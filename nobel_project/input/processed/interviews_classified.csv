Question;Response;Author ID;Predicted Category
Professor Zewail, let me first congratulate you to this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry for your pioneering work on femtosecond spectroscopy. Would you like to tell how you got started in this interesting field that you have developed?;"Well, you know, Professor Forsén, you know everybody thinks some times that science is done as a master plan and that somebody like me came from Mars and figured out everything and so on, but that’s really not the way it worked. We started at Caltech asking very simple questions: how do we understand the molecule dynamics or the dynamics of molecules, emotions and so on, molecules but in a coherent fashion. These molecules, there are millions and billions of them in the sample that we want to study, and they are all at random. And there are no relationship among them and we would like to just order them somehow so they all can behave at the end as if they are a single molecule at rejectory.
So in the beginning we were trying to develop new laser techniques to see how these molecules, if we prepare them coherent then study them in a coherent fashion that then we can learn about the intrinsic processes such as how does the energy move in the molecules, how molecules changing their orientation and so on. So we did some of the analogues of the powerful nuclear magnetic resonance techniques which you are very familiar with and used coherent pulses and pulse sequences. But then around 1980 I was asking the question: can we do the same thing in a single isolated molecule, completely isolated from the rest of the world? The environment is not there. So the question of using then a combination of molecular beams and ultra fast lasers came to mind and we started to initiate this research area which I had no idea what’s involved in terms of molecule beams but we had my students and I had to get into this area. And fundamentally we’re thinking about if we now excite an isolated molecule, no collision no /- – -/, that if we excite certain vibration in the molecule how would the energy move into all the other modes in the molecule.
And that was really the beginning of femtochemistry science …
There are many theories and many ideas of how this, and the typical one it goes back to your Arrhenius, namely that the energy will go in a random way. But to the pleasant surprise of all of us is that the energy was not randomising on the short time scale. We found actually that the energy goes from this mode to another mode and comes back even though we have millions, we have a whole forest of modes in the molecule, but the molecule is behaving very selectively and coherently and the molecules are very complex that we were studying. And that was really the beginning of femtochemistry science, because it immediately indicated to us that if we can excite molecules and initiate this in molecules on a very short time scale prior to their vibration and rotational and scrambling of energy and everything we should be seeing a whole new world of ordered coherence in them and by -87 we made what the Nobel citation called ‘the breakthrough’. Namely that by so doing we’re able to see the motions of the real atoms inside the molecules and with atomic scale resolution of the dynamics.";365;Creativity
Professor Zewail, the resolution at which one can study chemical reactions has been constantly decreasing over the past century. Do you think it will be possible, or is it even necessary to go further, right there in the future field of autochemistry?;"This is a legitimate question actually, because I wrote something about this, but the Nobel citation, which was very well written, actually pointed out that this is hint of the, if you like, there is a Guinness time. The reason for that it’s fundamental. It is not that we have to keep shortening the time. It turns out all molecular and biological systems have speeds of the atoms move inside them, the fastest possible speeds are determined by their molecular vibrations and this speeds is about a kilometre per second. One thousand metre per second, which means that if you have femtosecond time resolution or 10 to the -15 or 10 -14 second you have a distance resolution of about a 10th of an Ångström. That means really that you are now frozen all the chemical or biological structures on that times kill you can’t do any better.
What I think the OCT or sub-femtosecond is going to be important and I suggested this in one review article would be to go into the motion of the electrons. So, who knows it may be that we will see one day how we can localise also the electron just like we did with the nuclei. But I think that will be beyond the realm of chemistry and biology, you will be now addressing issues in physics looking at semi conductors and high energy physics and so on. But that’s … I don’t want to commit myself and then proven to be wrong later but that’s basically what I think about it at this point.";365;Future research
How do you see fusion directions in the studies of chemical and biological phenomena or time is loosen or the aura of femtoseconds, would it be possible to make sort of a snap shots x-ray the fraction in femtoseconds time scales or electron defraction. How do you see the future let’s say the next 10, 15, 20 years?;I’m glad you asked this question, Professor Forsén, firstly because I thought in my Nobel Lecture I pointed that I was delighted that the Swedish Academy of Science did not quote anything about my current work right now, because the current work that my group is focusing on is actually both the time resolve electrons and possibly x-rays to be able to get the architecture of these molecules, the molecular structures themselves, of very complex biological systems. That’s the ultimate goal. We have succeeded so far to do this defraction type experiment on smaller molecules and look at intermediate transit structure but you can imagine the power of this maybe in 10 years, when we are able to look say at the intermediates of proteins process. Or the motions of some of the DNA structures that we are interested in. The effect of salvation does the hydrophobic forces play a fundamental role in the process of folding. There was just a numerous questions I would like to ask and we really have to look at these snap shots at early times.;365;Future research
Femtochemistry provides really strong possibilities for new drugs, do you think it will ever be possible to study at that level in a living cell, perhaps study enzyme reactions?;Well. that will be really a fantastic advance. Of course the difficulty usually we get into this at this point in time is that in the cell there are the medium itself and the water and so on but one advantage of the femtosecond time resolution, and we demonstrated this in a number of studies, is that even in liquid type environment same coherence I was talking about and the motions that we see we can actually isolate because the protonation from the solvent is not turned on yet on that timescale. So, some people have started to use actually femtosecond methods to image processes in cells. There has been work on DNA, in fact I’m involved in this with my colleagues at Caltech in the looking at the transport of electrons in DNA. A lot of work has been done on proteins including cytocromoxides and others so, you’ll see a variety of applications in the coming years.;365;Future research
I know that you have been or you have a strong desire to promote science and help young scientist’s in your country of birth, Egypt. What are your plans in this direction? Could you tell something about that?;Yes, I do feel quite strongly about this that probably one of the things that unfortunately this age now to get a Nobel Prize is to really use part of it to help the young people get excited about science. In the States, in the world at large but also with particular focus on Egypt because I came from Egypt and I owe Egypt a lot to what I am now. And I do feel that there are tremendous amount of talent in Egypt, human resources. Human resources are just tremendous in Egypt but we need the science base, we need the correct science base. How to get these people to interact with each other. When I give a lecture on Egypt there are thousands of people in the lecture hall, so obviously they would like to go to science and they would love to do science, but you really have to get the correct science base in order for them to interact, so we are hoping to have maybe a little Caltech maybe a little /- – -/ do you know that just to start something there that really both Egyptians and colleagues from the western world and so on can interact with each other, give the students the exchange and do science at the frontiers.;365;Advice  for young scientists
I think the Nobel Prize will help you in this respect?;I think the Nobel Prize helps for a number of reasons. Number one, if I can be frank, there is these people will feel by getting a Nobel Prize that I’m one of them, that it is possible to contribute on the world map of science and technology. That’s not only in the hands of the Swedes and the Americans and the British and so on. That they could if they worked hard and they have the abilities and so on, they can achieve even on the highest level. And the other thing also which I’m hoping for is that the government in Egypt is willing and interested in promoting science and technology and this is an ideal time now to be able to do something.;365;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Are there certain fields of science which you think might be especially well suited to young scientist in Egypt?;I think in Egypt and all over the world you know, David, there are many books I read talking about the end of science. There are many, many books I’ve read and I think this is quite naïve actually because we all just try to uncover something. But the universe at large is full of questions that we still don’t know anything about and there will be always young people brilliant who are going to make new discoveries. I mean if you think in 1999, now this is an ending year of this millennium and you just think about the world of the very small, thinking about manipulating the atoms and the molecules. Think about the whole world of biological complex sciences. We still don’t understand the way a protein folds the way it does. I mean it’s an amazing thing. So, all of this is opened up, you go to the very big, you go to astronomy, we still don’t understand how the big bang and evolving all the way to the human species and so on. So all of this is going to be a very, very exciting to the new people. But for me to sit down here, even as a Nobel Laureate and make a prediction about which science I think that will be a mistake.;365;Advice for young scientists
Scientists are supposed to be creative and surely they certainly are and you were a most creative man. What are your best creative moments, is it in the shower when you are listening to music in the early mornings can you say something about that?;Yes, it’s a crazy actually moments you just never know. Well, one of the things I enjoy most is to be left alone with a book. I am not one of the new media experts working all the time with my computers and the PowerPoint’s and things of that sort. So, I’m an old fashioned still in this regard but these are the moment where I really can be creative, if I am, to be left alone with just a book and piece of paper and to be thinking. And I think actually one of the messages to the young people building on David’s question, is the internet and all this wonderful thing we have, these are not thinking machines. These are information gathering, but you should have some time to think and that’s very important.;365;Environment
Nobel Laureates usually complain that getting the Nobel Prize perturbs their life infinitely and how do you try to get away from, to find your sort of precious moments or creativity in the future?;Well, I’ll tell you a story and I’ll tell you how I’m trying to do it. When they called me with the Nobel call from Secretary General of the Swedish Academy it was twenty minutes to six and he said well that was well hope I’m not disturbing you but I am the Secretary General of the Swedish Academy. Of course you can imagine I was frozen in time when he said that but then he made a very famous statement, something to the effect that this is the last 20 minutes of peace of your life. And he was right at six o’clock exactly until today I just have not had the time to be in equilibrium with myself. We receive thousands of e-mails and faxes and so on. But I want to really focus on doing this two things I really would like to focus on science and the excitement of science and to help with science. So, that’s my intention to focus my efforts there and I hope I will be able to do so.;365;Impact of the Nobel on you
Back to your previous answer going to the internet, there’s a lot of talk about information overload that there’s so much information flowing out especially with computers and things that people get sort of too much and can’t think any longer. Do you think that that could be a problem for scientists that it could eventually even become detrimental that there so much information that it becomes difficult to sort of concentrate on a specific area?;Yes, I do have a concern however, humanity has a great way of adapting and I’m sure scientists of the future, probably after I leave this planet, earth will have a new way of dealing with the internet but I do have a concern in the transition period, namely that … I’ll give you an example, when I was a graduate student and we get a journal, let’s say in your case molecular biology or if you’re not chemical physics or something. You know we are dying to take the whole journal and find out the different areas of science. Professor Forsén is aware of many areas that going on in from physical chemistry to molecular biology but because of the internet nowadays people are getting more and more specialised and so you found that I found with my students they don’t necessarily look at journals any more, but they print right away from the internet what’s relevant to what’s he doing you see. Yes and you’re probably a living example.;365;Role of Science
We have actually received a question from Egypt from a student at the American University in Cairo and he says Sir, addressing you, in your judgment, who was the best chemist, physicist, biologist in this millennium?;Millennium, yes, not century, well I think that’s a million dollar type question. But I would like to tell this young person who’s asking the question from the American University in Cairo, is that in science doesn’t work this way. Scientists contribute in a variety of ways and I don’t think I can singular one even including Einstein, that I can say that he’s the best. We don’t work like the best basketball player and the best musician and so on. Science is a collective effort. I built on the efforts of a previous scientist, others will build on the work I’m doing and if I look at the whole scope from chemistry to biology to physics, it’s just the list is too long to mention just one and it’s not fair to the others.;365;Advice for young scientists
Professor Kohn, thank you for seeing us today, it’s very nice to meet you. You got the Prize in Chemistry 1998 and that took a few … that was quite a number of years after you did your remarkable discovery. How have you dealt with this prize, this award and how has it, how has it affected your life?;"I’ll answer this in two parts. I mean one is simply how has receiving the Nobel Prize affected my life and the other one is, the second part is how has the fact that I’ve suddenly been transformed into a chemist affected my life and it’s, in both cases really very positive. Insofar as the first half of your question is concerned I think most of my colleagues who have received a Nobel Prize have probably had the similar experience. The fact that you receive the Nobel Prize suddenly means that broadly speaking people take you more seriously suddenly and that means that if one has some principles, some convictions and is not totally satisfied with the world as it is, one now has …
… here is the leading country in the world, but look at its health system …
Let me first say an opportunity, but really in certain sense a responsibility to do something with it. Not to let it be. I mean whether one’s concern is for example as an American I’m very concerned about the fact that here is the leading country in the world, but look at its health system. So health system is on the one hand in many areas the best in the world, on the other hand, if you look at the fraction of people, including millions of children who are getting very poor, sometimes no health care, it’s shocking. So as an example of something that I felt very upset about for many years.";366;Impact of Nobel on you
Do you speak out about that?;Yes, you know, I speak out on it and, and the same about several other areas that concern me, so.;366;Meaning (Values) of Work
And during your speech in -98 you said that for example working for peace is something of importance.;"Yes, and I continue to do this quite actively. I’ll just mention something very concrete, I’m a research Professor at the University of California, the Santa Barbara Campus, and the University of California is, has been managing the two, the two nuclear weapons laboratories in America, I think I’m correct in saying that every advance in the effectiveness of nuclear weapons – and one has to stop for a moment and ask oneself whether the word “advance” is the appropriate word – was done under the management of the University of California. It’s my University. It bothers me a lot and so the …
This management of the weapons laboratories by the University of California with some little glitches and some modifications is negotiated typically for a period of five years and then in the past has always been renewed. But it has to go through a renewal process. So the renewal process is just in progress now and I’ve spent a lot of time on this. I have spoken not only on my Campus but I’ve had a video made and the video has been used in Los Angeles at UCLA and so I had this what I call the opportunity and I personally felt the responsibility to speak up on this question.";366;Creativity
And the other part is that you got it for chemistry, but you are not a chemist.;"No I, yes that’s quite correct and well, that’s the situation, I’m actually very comfortable with it. Chemists do use my work extensively and they appreciate it and they are, because they appreciate it they are without exception very friendly towards me. They would be in a position extremely easily to embarrass me terribly, but no-one has ever tried that. I can tell you a slightly amusing story.
The day after I received the Prize of course it was quite a sensation in my little town in Santa Barbara, so I walked across the Campus and two students, two women students, are walking in the opposite direction, and they must have seen my picture somewhere, perhaps in the student newspaper, and so one of them turns around and comes back and says to me “Are you the guy who won the Nobel Prize?” and I said “Yes, I am” and so they both gave me a very friendly hug and then they kept going again, but then one came back again and said “Do you mind, we are just going to a chemistry exam, can we ask you a question?”
… at a certain theoretic level chemistry and physics are very close to each other …
So yes I was in a very tight spot! So I said “well try me” and I started praying very hard because I knew that the more elementary the questions would be the less likely that I could answer them! And so then this one young woman began to ask a question and then I recognised an interesting fact. You see my … the fact that I got the Nobel Prize in Chemistry reflects the fact that at a certain theoretic level chemistry and physics are very close to each other, but also at the lowest level they’re very close to each other and these girls didn’t really know the difference between physics and chemistry. So the question they had for me was in fact a physics question. So I gave them a brilliant answer! They were very impressed.";366;Motivation
Is it that these areas that you getting the Prize in, so to speak, maybe they do overlap more and more in the modern scientific world?;Yes, I would say yes, but I would not go along with some kind of world picture that all sciences will become unified. I think different sciences, and of course each science evolves over time, but by and large they do have their own characteristics which differ, and I personally think that’s for the good because then science as a whole is enriched by this difference. Vive la difference!;366;Diversity in sicence
If you advise students today at the Campus, or people who are … who would listen to this interview who want to go into scientific research, what would you give them, what kind of advice would you give them?;First of all I would like to get to know the person a little bit before I offer any advice, because promising young scientists are already rather exceptional people and they are all different from each other and …;366;Advice for young researchers
Then a specific quality that you have to have, do you have to endure long nights of hard work and days?;"Well, many yes, and some no. So I wanted to make a caveat before I say anything, because what I say is perhaps broadly sensible, but there will be some cases where it will be absolutely the wrong advice, and well let me think about this, I’d say perhaps two or three words of advice. Number one: Be prepared for some great excitement and great personal rewards but mostly disappointments, and you must last through disappointments and you have to be prepared for them. So that’s one piece of advice.
… I myself feel very much like a global citizen and it’s one of the best parts of my life …
Another piece that I would offer is, but again I would come back and say, I know people who would not say that, but in general I think scientists have a great opportunity to combine their intellectual or in some cases mechanical abilities on the one hand with playing a useful role in society, and whether it’s their town, or their country or whether it’s global, and of course scientists are a very global group and of course Nobel himself sort of highlights this globality of science, and I think I myself feel very much like a global citizen and it’s one of the best parts of my life. I mean I’m just coming from two hours conversations with students from all over, you know, the kind of students that come here literally all over the world and it’s very few things that are more richer, that richer experience.";366;Competencies
Professor, you said you, you know, the scientists feel like a citizen of the world often and certainly one can describe you as a citizen of the world. You were born in Austria, but your childhood was made traumatic as you had to flee during the Nazi takeover of Austria. Could you tell us something about that?;"I had traumatic experiences in my childhood. The traumatic experiences were related with the so-called Anschluss, the joining of Austria to Germany during the Hitler time in 1938. Before that, looking back at least, I feel I had a generally good childhood. So my problems were … many people of course suffered under the Hitler regime, my family and I suffered like all other people who were in the same situation because of our religion. We were Jewish. Now the … was that traumatic? Yes, it was terribly traumatic, I mean the entire family was totally uprooted, destabilised, maltreated, I was thrown out of my school in a day, as I remember, and so there were things of that sort. Now I want to say first of all that my parents did succeed to help both my sister and myself to emigrate, we both emigrated first to England, unfortunately they were unable to emigrate and they were eventually murdered.
I did not ever even think about returning, it was unbearable for me …
Both my sister and I had a wonderful experience in England, a family that we had not ever encountered personally had some business relationship with my father took us into their home and treated us as family members and were absolutely wonderful. My sister eventually returned to Vienna after she married an Austrian, another Austrian émigré. I did not ever even think about returning, it was unbearable for me, and after, so then I had bizarre experiences, in retrospect right I was threatened with extermination by the Austrians and Germans but on the other hand the English regarded me as a potential spy for the Germans, and in turn me and thousands of others who are close to years, and so I had bizarre experiences of this sort. Of course compared to the horror of people who had to stay behind I was in my personal body, so to speak, I was fortunate, the loss of my parents was of course disaster.";366;Motivation
So after the years in England you went to Canada, you emigrated to Canada, or was sent to Canada. What happened there?;"Well, in Canada I, together with I think approximately within five and ten thousand other people in similar situations, was put into an internment camp. You may wonder how did they happen to have this internment camp ready, well they had it ready because they arranged, the Canadians, with the British at the British request to build these internment camps in order to be prepared for the thousands of German prisoners of war they expected. Well the war didn’t go that way, in the initial period the British, the little British expeditionary force in France they were incredibly lucky to get away with their skin and they came back to Britain and I think a single prisoner came back with their skin, so there were these camps waiting and here were we, the suspected spy.
So, yes we were put in these camps and I want to say right away we were treated very humanely. It was sometimes difficult because there were a few real Nazis in there, a small minority, but they were very in the early phases of the war, the war was going splendidly for the Germans and so whenever there was a great victory on the East Coast, right, these people would have their celebrations, and of course the rest of us got very upset about this. So it was unpleasant, nothing really serious, nobody lost his life but few people lost a few teeth! Otherwise, there was a wonderful man there I encountered several times in my life these people that were there, this was a man by the name of Heckscher, a German art historian, and we encountered him as this dedicated person, very capable, very intelligent and he was going to establish a school in camp for young people like me. Himself was about 20 years older, in his late thirties, and he inspired respect by everybody including the officers who treated him pretty much as their equal. He was not Jewish but he had been … his family had been in the business of helping camp prisoner of war camp inmates for the second generation, his father had done this in the First World War and so he took over the family tradition. So he established a very good camp school.
There were some brilliant people in the camp and so I divided my time roughly half to studying and the other half we were given the opportunity, but not required, to do work of different kinds, so the work, I had two kinds that I liked best was making camouflage nets for the British Armed Forces, that’s very calming for the nerves, you stand there and you have sort of three movements that you learn in five minutes and then you repeat them tens of thousands of times and of course you no longer know you are doing this, and you can dream, whatever, talk to your neighbour. And the other activity in Canada, you will be surprised, was lumber work, cutting trees. So of course I mean from time to time we felt a little sorry for ourselves, I mean why are we in this camp and why can’t we go out and so on, but …";366;Life
When did you set your heart on science then?;Perhaps the most influential person was somebody I encountered after the Anschluss in Austria. I was expelled from my school, there was some temporary arrangements, complicated, I skipped them for a few months, the Anschluss was in March, next September some of us who had high grades in school were given the opportunity to enter into a newly organised, that’s not quite correct, but let me just say to enter into a re-organised school which was exclusively for Jewish students and with Jewish teachers. Many of them did not survive. The director was a physicist and so he directed the school and he taught physics. Then his Latin teacher was arrested and didn’t come back, and so the director who had taken Latin in school also taught Latin, and he didn’t know much Latin but he came into class with the books that were supposed to be read, some of the classic Latin poets, Ovid, Virgil, and a dictionary. So he taught us from the books and the dictionary …;366;Creativity
Which way was he influencing you to become a physicist?;Well, he taught physics also. He influenced me both very much just admirable personality generally and inexplicably it was evident to me from the beginning that this man really knew science. Really understood science. Then about ten years later I found out that he had been an assistant of Einstein’s and he was an incredible man. I think without meeting him, and I had another very good teacher, a mathematician in the same school, without these two gentlemen I probably would not have become a scientist. My interests before that time, I was very enthusiastic about something but it wasn’t science, it was Latin.;366;Motivation
How did you come to end up in science? Was there a family background in science? What started you?;"My family has no scientific background. As a child I lived in a small town in the West of England. My father was a shop keeper. He owned and ran the men’s clothing store in this town. My mother’s family were mostly farmers from different parts of England. So I had no professional scientific background in my family. As a child I did become extremely interested in mathematics at about the age of 11 or 12. I was by that time already keeping my father’s accounts, large sums to be added up in pounds, shilling and pence, which is quite complicated mathematics. And I became very facile in doing this sort of thing.
I used to make sometimes deliberate errors in mathematics classes so that I would not appear to be too smart …
But then at the age of 12, when I started being exposed to algebra in school, I became extremely fascinated and spent much of my time teaching myself at the age of 12 more advanced parts of mathematics. In fact, I taught myself calculus using an old book which I found in a waste basket and I took it out of the waste basket and read it from cover to cover. So by the age of 12 I was already actively thinking about mathematical problems. I was thinking about permutations and extending tables of factorials to non-integer values, various projects which I formulated and tried to solve, not always successfully, but I was doing research projects in mathematics when I was quite young. So that was really my introduction to academic subjects. Actually at that age I was quite secretive about it. I did not tell my teachers that I had taught myself calculus. And for a while I was reluctant for this to be known, and I used to make sometimes deliberate errors in mathematics classes so that I would not appear to be too smart. One feels the pressure from one’s peers at that stage. But then after two or three years I sort of went public with this. Then the school authorities, this is at Bristol Grammar School which did have a very fine mathematics teacher, they told me that I should study for the scholarship exam for Cambridge. So I spent the last two or three years really preparing for this competitive intake at Trinity College Cambridge, which is where mathematicians tend to go in Britain, because they have a great history in development of mathematics.
So I went to Cambridge to take the scholarship examinations in the middle of the War, in 1942. At that time it was not too easy to go to University because almost all young men, I was 17 at the time, were conscripted into the army. But there was a programme for a small number of mathematics students to go to university, to Cambridge, to take a mathematics degree in a very short compressed period and then go into government service in some form of operations, research. This turned out to be a very successful programme. Some of the people who were in the programme before me that were older than me had made major contributions to the British war effort. Freeman Dyson was one such person. He was in exactly the same programme two years older than me, and he was in Cambridge between 1941 and 1943, and I think he went on to become an adviser to the air force in the latter part of the war. In my case I went to Cambridge in 1943 and by the time I’d completed my degree in 1945 the war was just ending so I never really did anything useful in the war time.";367;Creativity
Then you went on to PhD studies?;Yes, in 1945 as the war was ending I was, the government didn’t quite know what to do with me because the war effort was winding down. So I was sent off into industry and I worked for the Bristol Aeroplane Company for two years, not doing anything very significant, until I could get back to Cambridge to start a research career. And so I returned in 1947. I spent one year doing sort of post graduate courses in all branches of applied mathematics and then it was after that that I decided to become a theoretical scientist. And at that point I picked on chemistry as a field that I would enter. But until then I had no background in chemistry. I’d given up chemistry at a quite early stage in high school. I decided this was a good opportunity. It turned out well.;367;Creativity
Also you started working on quantum chemical methods and development on computational techniques?;"Yes. In the early days a felt that a theoretical chemist should really address all branches of chemistry and I did work as I told you on liquids, statistical mechanics or liquids. And I also started doing some work on quantum mechanics, there’s early papers on that by 1952. And then I did the nuclear magnetic resonance. So I used to switch from one topic to another every two or three years. But that became more and more difficult I think because as fields grow you need a great deal of technical expertise.
So in 1958 I took an administrative job which was for several years which I didn’t like very much. And when I gave that up I decided that I would return to full time research, with the main emphasis on quantum mechanics, of electronic structure of molecules, which is the most fundamental part of theoretical chemistry, basic understanding of how molecules, why molecules behave as they do. So that is the time at which I moved with my family to the United States.  And the projects for which the Nobel Prize was awarded were started around that time.";367;Motivation
How would you see also the future development of quantum chemistry? Will faster computers influence quantum chemistry?;Progress has taken place in both respects. One has been able to achieve more efficient or new methods, or more efficient ways of handling the same method. Certain theoretical computations may start off being rather expensive and hard to use except for very small molecules. But then one can do a lot of research on new mathematical schemes which will get the same answer with far fewer operations. That has been a major focus of work and that has enabled the techniques to be applied not only to very small molecules but to many molecules, larger molecules, and to begin to make really significant predictions about chemical behaviour. And that will certainly continue. Computers are clearly going to get faster and faster and we are continually working on ways of making our methods used to fewer and fewer multiplications to get bigger and bigger systems. So this is very much a development along the same path. You can never tell whether a totally new method will come in and demolish all existing procedures, but I don’t see it at the moment.;367;Future Research
Would you see for example a kind of fusion of molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry?;Yes, that’s right. The good quantum chemistry, high level theories can still only be applied to systems of up to maybe 100 electrons. And it’s important to be able to examine systems which are in solution for example, where you have to take account of all the rest of the material. So there’s important work going on on kind of multiple techniques where you use a quantum mechanical study of, a good quantum mechanical study of a central part of a molecule or system, that you need to study carefully. And it’s surrounded by a solvent or the rest of a large protein or something which are simulated in a cruder fashion so that you can still get the general effects of the medium on the chemistry that’s going on.;367;Future research
At this meeting many things have also happened. Two days ago there was a joint announcement by groups from the States and Britain and other countries that have completed the sequence for 99 or 97% of the human genome. It’s regarded by many as a milestone in the human history, science history. And probably rightly so. I know that you take an interest also in biological systems and would you like to comment on these recent events that we have witnessed?;Yes, well that is certainly the complete knowledge of the human genome would be a big step forward. I think from a scientific point of view one may well desire to have the sequences of many more species before we can begin to really get a further understanding of evolutionary processes and how they have taken place. Biology is really a giant study in the history of particular chemical reactions which has gone on for three to four billion years over a complicated fashion. And the fundamentally interesting point is how did this come about and how did it develop in its various branches. And we’ve heard something of this of course in the talks this morning. So I think this is a big development. It’s clearly the way that the future of the science will go. I’m sure there’ll be the sort of political pressure to work primarily on the human condition rather than other species, which might be more informative, and on which one might be able to do it as was pointed out this morning, on which it might be possible to do more actual experiments.;367;Creativity
You have had a lot of students over the years, what advice have you given them during their carreer?;For my students? Well I’ve had a very fine set of students. I’ve always tried to advise them to handle research in an innovative but critical manner. It’s all about, research is all about getting new ideas. It’s always desirable to question existing ideas. It’s always desirable to formulate your ideas in as simple a fashion as possible, to test them as carefully and as fully as possible for the whole series of steps which I think constitute good research. And many of my students, I think, are very proud of their subsequent careers, have done very well. I’ve got to the age where I actually find myself going to dinners for retirement of people who were students of mine. So after one’s own retirement one starts attending other people’s retirements or 60th birthdays and all those things.;367;Advice for young researchers
So then you went to university, was that in Wisconsin or?;Paul D. Boyer: That was in Wisconsin. One of the professors at the University of Wisconsin had discovered that you can put vitamin D into milk by shining ultraviolet light so they patented it and the monies from that, they set up for scholarships and when I finished at the University of Utah, there was no course in biochemistry. I hardly knew that biochemistry existed but I was interested in, I knew enough to know that it was there but I didn’t know nearly the extent of the field, but there was a scholarship notice on the bulletin board that the University of Wisconsin, there was a scholarship that you could apply for to study biochemistry.;368;Creativity
Sounds good, but this is also where you began with your work on the enzymes in energy metabolism in more serious ways?;Paul D. Boyer: Most of my career I spent working on these big molecules, they’re called enzymes, they do catalysis, they’re ones that make chemical reactions go and at that stage, I worked actually on an interesting enzyme in the Nobel Medical Institute and had a nice little publication with Professor Theorell from there. It was actually, well I won’t tell you what it was.;368;Research
No, no. But so then, when did you actually do the work on the ATP synthase? When did that begin?;Paul D. Boyer: That began in early 1970s. We had spent a considerable effort in the 1960s, in this process, as you know, of oxidated phosphorylation, the ATP, there’s lots of it made, it’s a very important compound. We thought from the paradigms in biochemistry, the way that we knew from other biochemical things that there should be an intermediate in the thing, so we spent lots of years looking for intermediate. Now I have a tendency to be lucky, because we did find a substance that we thought was an intermediate oxidated phosphorylation in making the ATP as we breathe oxygen. It turned out to be, though, an intermediate in a lower cycle, not the big problem, but the small problem, but it was a new chemical compound, never seen before in nature and it’s phosphohistidine, the first time it had been described and so then we’d at least, as I’ve sometimes said, we were reaching for a gold but we got a brass.;368;Research
So then maybe if we now look at the work today in bioenergetics, what would you say is the most important questions that should be looked at today in this field?;"Paul D. Boyer: The immediate questions, well the enzyme that I worked with is ATP synthase. Now, to tell you what I think the most important questions are, I need to tell you a bit more about the molecule itself. The mitochondrion, the inter-cellular organelle of which this is made, has a membrane in which the enzyme can, I know you’re well acquainted with this, and that’s through this membrane, you develop with the oxidations and electrochemical grating the charge across the membrane that wants to push positively charged protons through the membrane.
Now, we worked mostly on the part of the enzyme that was above the membrane. This is the membrane, we worked on the part that was above this. That’s where the adenosine and triphosphatase push is, as you know, and so we found that the protons, when they go through the membrane, cause the internal part of this to rotate like a motor and change, as you know, with the outer sub-units. I’d say one of the biggest problems in bioenergetics at the present time relates to this proton translocation. It’s not known how the proton translocation makes the bottom part turn. We know that it turns and does this, so one of the immediate important problems is try to get the structure of that bottom part and to deduce how it turns. Now that holds, then, not only for this one but for a whole host of bioenergetic processes that use membranes and translocation of ions across the membrane.";368;Future research
And did the hormone denominate, to some extent, these processes?;"Paul D. Boyer: Yes, to look for other things, for active transport of amino acids, you see, and it still is not known how the lactose transporter works in any detail, so there’s these problems in bioenergetics at the same level of explanation that we sought for the ATP synthase. Now those are the, what should I say? Those are the visible problems, those are the ones that are continuation of present aspects to get more explanations of them. Now, that doesn’t mean they aren’t important because our ATP synthase work was a continuation of trying to understand how oxidated phosphorylation occurred and then in terms of the bioenergetics and the mechanisms, the whole field of motion and contractility is opening up in a lovely way. We don’t yet, though, know how cells move across each other.
For example, in evolution, you produce, we think of the evolving of life on earth as working into a single cell organism and this is the way it was for billions of years. For billions of years, there were only bacteria, you see, and then we achieve a mollusc cellular organism. In order to do that, we had to have cells to start communicating with each other. Now, communication and control is in one sense bioenergetics, you see, and they had to learn how to move with respect to one another. How do cells move during development, you see? What is this type of thing? How do you use it to that? And the control of that movement, you see. The control of that movement makes it so that that movement produces an ear on this side some way.";368;Creativity
That may come for the future. Ok. Well, is there anything you would like to add that we haven’t talked about that we should discuss?;"Paul D. Boyer: Oh yes. If you push a button on a professor, he’s always willing to talk. I would like to comment on two things. One, the Nobel Prizes. The responsibility of the Nobel committee is, as I’m sure you’re aware, they’re writing the history of science. They choose just one to the problem but the ones they choose become then much better known in nature so I think this is one of the prominent functions of the Nobel; but the other one relates to the public understanding of science. I think the fact that there is a Nobel Prize, that it gets in the newspapers, they’ve done a good job, up until my selection, of goods selections, you see, so that it’s been well received on it. This has helped the interaction of science and society because I feel that the privilege of being a scientist at the present time in our society is a remarkably fine thing, both for the scientist and humanity.
I think within a grouping of a university setting, where you can get a grouping of students and post-doctor of follows, that are sitting around a table here with 10 or 12 of you trying to understand the experiments you’ve just completed, trying to devise the experiments you want to do next, discussing them in an atmosphere where it’s bringing the best thoughts of these people. Out of this then comes the milieu and the things that makes it possible for me to think of a new approach at a different time, you see. I think that grouping of scholars in a university supporting now by society, they give us billion, they give us monies to buy instruments, is the finest thing that’s been developed to try to understand nature, to try to get the answers of science and then, so I appreciate that, I think that this is something that we need to tell humanity we appreciate.
Now, the other part of that is, is that what is produced out of basic research has done so much to change the world. Now, either you want to understand how the world operates and let it change and let it enrich the lives of the other people. To me, when I can listen to a fine piece of creative music, that’s an enrichment that somebody else gave me but I think for the general public, when they can learn about how the oxygen that they breathe, what it does or how the last aspect of astronomy, I think they appreciate it. I think there’s a beauty to it so I think we return to the …";368;Creativity
Professor Curl, I believe I read something about you, that you got your first chemistry box when you were quite a small child? Was that how it all started?;"Robert F. Curl Jr.: That’s right. 
Robert F. Curl Jr.: Yes, it really is, I got this chemistry set I think it was for Christmas it’s a little hard to remember for sure. I had a little room over the garage that I could play with it in and essentially what I did was all of the little experiments that they suggested in the booklet that came with it and I hadn’t exhausted possibility for mixing up chemicals so I tried mixing every possible combination to see what happened. And I became fascinated with chemistry and decided essentially then to become a chemist.";371;Creativity
You didn’t scare your parents, did anything that sort of upset them?;Robert F. Curl Jr.: I did upset my mother on one occasion, this was much later when I was in high school, I was doing some experiment on her stove and boiled over some nitric acid and ate the enamel off the stove and did bother her quite a bit. In fact, she talked about it for years.;371;Family/Home Environment
Is that something, if you have children in your family or grandchildren or so on, do you encourage that kind of you know experimenting and being so curious?;Robert F. Curl Jr.: I encouraged … I’m beginning to despair because neither one of my two sons who have gone on to be quite, you know, they’re adults and actually middle aged now and been quite successful, are not at all interested in that sort of thing. I would buy a little kit to do electronics or something and they would not be very interested doing any of the little experiments;371;Creativity
Not even after you got a Nobel Prize?;Robert F. Curl Jr.: They were of course adult by that time. My grandchildren have not been particularly interested so far. I have one yet coming that’s not yet five that may turn out to might be interested in doing something but no, it hadn’t happened.;371;Impact of the Nobel on you
Did you think that there was a possibility for you to get the prize when you discovered what you discovered together with your colleagues and put them together and started to work together?;"Robert F. Curl Jr.: No, I always have judged the interest in things on the attitude of organic chemists. They’re, in the United States at least, the organic chemists are the ones who create the atmosphere for chemistry. And they … I remember in the years following doing this experiment that I would go and give a talk about the work that we had done on carbonate some place and I’d give this talk and people would be interested. They would inevitably at the end of the talk, there would be some organic chemists who would raise his hand and say can I see a sample of this material? And then I would have to explain that no we were only talking about a few thousands molecules in a big machine and that we’ve never actually seen a large sample and they would immediately lose interest.
And so I couldn’t conceive that there would be a prize if the organic chemists were not interested in it. And what changed things was the work of Wolfgang Krätschmer and Donald Huffman who made and developed a method for making microscopic samples of these materials. Then the organic chemists could get their hands on it and it was at that point that I thought there might be a prize for either them or us.";371;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I was thinking now and when patent is becoming or has been but is becoming more and more important and sometimes it also become a big quarrel between the scientist and maybe the university or the company that you’re working for, when you do your major discovery, how can one get around that or has it badly influenced the social aspect of research do you think?;Robert F. Curl Jr.: I don’t know that it in terms of academic research I don’t know that it has. For one thing, certainly in the past, most university professors were not working in things that were immediately patentable. That’s changing, people are more interested in doing things that are of practical importance. In my university, occasionally we get into an interesting paradox because by university regulation the PhD final oral examination is public, it has to be publicly announced and anyone can come and for some of us, some of the professors who are working with very commercially interesting things they find themselves in a really serious bind.;371;Creativity
You did say after having received this award that people ask you all sorts of questions and you’re sort of supposed to know all the answers to it, all different issues and what goes on with humankind?;Robert F. Curl Jr.: You get used to saying I don’t know. I hated that because you know you’re trained to avoid ignorance to try to know things and so to constantly have to say I don’t know is, you know, it’s hard, it takes a while to get used to that.;371;Impact of the Nobel on you
Has it changed your working life though, this award?;"Robert F. Curl Jr.: Yes, it changed it both positive and negative ways. The positive way has been that it’s been easier to get money and co-workers I think. The negative way is that you get a lot of e-mails of course not a whole lot but enough to be significant of email correspondence about things that you would really not particularly want get involved with. Things like getting messages from students.
There are two kinds of messages from students, the one kind is the one where the student really seems to be genuinely interested and has some question that shows that they’ve actually thought about something and then there’s the student who has a homework assignment and feels that this would be a good way to get help on their assignment. And so the first kind I enjoy, the second kind you know I don’t want to feel caught on a crux because you don’t want to discourage any serious student, but you don’t see how it actually helps their development for you to supply them with answers to their assignment, so.";371;Impact of the Nobel on you
Any specific … do you think that scientists of your calibre, those who have received the award from the Nobel Foundation, have any specific responsibilities?;Robert F. Curl Jr.: I don’t think we have any more responsibility than the average citizen has, we don’t, you know, we haven’t become brilliant overnight. Getting the Nobel Prize did not increase our intelligence, let’s put it that way. And it certainly didn’t make us experts in all areas. So, it does give you a certain ability to get people to listen. And so, therefore you have a responsibility as any citizen would have if you feel that there is something you have to say that people really need to listen to, then you should definitely go ahead and say it and try to do what you can to either improve things or try and help overt disaster.;371;Impact of the Nobel on you
So your basic degree was in chemistry and then you specialised in spectroscopy after that?;Sir Harold Kroto: My best subjects at school were geography and art and then sciences. We weren’t encouraged to consider art as a possible career. We were encouraged to consider going to Oxford and Cambridge, to do Latin or something like that. I went to quite a good school. It was more easy in those days if you passed exams to go to certain schools. This school is now really more of a public school or what you call in the States a private school. I was able to go to this rather good school called Bolton School. I got a few little scholarships worth eight pounds a month or something like that to help. But I was good at chemistry, and gradually …;372;Creativity
Microwave spectroscopy became your speciality at some point?;"Sir Harold Kroto: Yes. What happened at university is … I was introduced to quantum mechanics and the experimental data that underpinned quantum mechanics is spectroscopy and I was in chemistry and I was taught spectroscopy by Richard Dixon as an undergraduate. And I somehow got quite fascinated by it. The fact that a molecule could count, you know there were regular series, beautiful patterns which I got interested in. Although I was very interested in organic chemistry at that time. I thought … When I wanted to do my PhD I’d like to do spectroscopy. I was in Sheffield where George Porter was, who got the Nobel Prize for flash photolysis, and so it was very exciting time because George had set up all this flash photolysis apparatus. There was that apparatus that belonged to him and Richard Dixon and I worked for Richard but I saw George all the time. He and Richard were quite influential in this.
I enjoyed it. I could play tennis and I could do graphics for the university magazine. I could play the guitar because in those days all the kids at university could play the guitar and sing in folk groups. I was having a good time. and then went to Ottawa to do more flash photolysis. Electronic spectroscopy. After one year in one lab I moved to work with Cec Costain, to do microwave spectroscopy, which is actually a lot simpler than the others. Electronic spectroscopy you have electronic motion, you have vibrational motio,n but in rotational you just have the rotation. So in a sense it’s simpler but more precise. And I was a chemist. So you could use microwave spectroscopy to study moderately complex molecules. I started to realise that it would allow me to do chemistry and identify the molecules and study them by what we call microwave spectroscopy.";372;Creativity
I read here that in the mid 60s you went to the University of Sussex. Was that for your further academic career?;Sir Harold Kroto: Yes, because I went to do a post doc in Canada at the National Research Council for two years. 1964 to 66. In 67 I went to Bell Telephone for a year. My boss there, Johan Powell, then went to Case Western Reserve, and I had an offer of a post doctoral tutorial fellow. Slightly above a post doctoral fellowship at Sussex. When Johan left to go to Case I thought I’ll go back to Sussex. And that’s where I went and after half the year I was fortunately, or unfortunately, offered a permanent position there which I took. I spent five years trying to do something as a lecturer at Sussex and if it didn’t work I’d probably go and do night school and go into graphics and design. After five years things were starting to tick over. But I would say it took seven years to get really going which is a long time.;372;Creativity
Was it very hectic? You were busy all the time?;Sir Harold Kroto: Well, it wasn’t. It was hectic, but I had an idea that this would work. A student would have an idea. Results just seemed to pour out during that period in a way that they haven’t happened ever since.;372;Creativity
What is carbine?;Sir Harold Kroto: Carbine. It’s supposed to be a solid made from polyines and whenever you try to condense polyines they blow up, so if carbine exists at all it can only exist for a very short time before it blows up and cross links to form a highly exothermic reaction in which things blow up. And I’ve seen these explosions anyway, so I had problems with it. But I thought they were graphite sheets. Sheets of graphite and you could rationalise that a sheet with an even number of atoms would be a little bit more stable than a sheet with an odd number of atoms. I looked at it but I didn’t pay a lot of attention to this. I thought that looks like what these things are. I think I should have been smarter than that. I feel I should have looked at that in more detail. Most of the experiment had been carried out. They hadn’t done the reactions with hydrogen and nitrogen that I’d wanted to do. There was another group at Bell Labs that also did the same experiment. In the Exxon work they had seen C60. But anyway the Bell Labs had seen C60 and picked it off. In our experiments we carried out some experiments which really changed the conditions. Really pushing this experiment. Not let’s do this in random and then rush to the next one. We found that the 60 signal could be made extremely strong. I’m sure if Exxon or Bell had persevered and changed the reaction conditions in the way that we did they would have seen the same results and they would have discovered C60. They would have said this thing is so strong, what structural explanation is there for this strong signal. And they didn’t do that. So I wouldn’t be sitting here being asked about it because they would have discovered it.;372;Research
Can I round off by asking … Now it seems that there are coming some practical applications that you make materials out of …maybe not balls but at least tubes of this kind of materials. Do you have any ideas about this or would you say it’s more of the beauty of nature?;Sir Harold Kroto: I think there’s still some major problems to be solved. There is no doubt that the round cages are beautiful and they’ve changed our understanding of graphite and how graphite behaves, that it can close up into a cage. The nanotubes which were discovered by Japanese Sumio Igima. They’re very interesting. They’re elongated cages. They bear the same relationship to a dome or a ball as a tube does to these so called nanotubes. They’re fascinating. They can conduct like metals you know inorganic super conductor. They’re extremely strong. Probably the strongest materials ever made. But to actually use those properties is a major problem which has yet to be solved. And maybe quite difficult. I’m a bit apprehensive that the applications of nanotubes and C60 will be in the near future still have big technological problems. There’s always the hint of exciting promise. Getting that promise to the marketplace is another matter.;372;Meaning (Values) of Work
Dr Crutzen, I would like to begin to ask you something about your family background, where you grew up and where you went to school and so on?;"Paul J. Crutzen: I’m born in Amsterdam in 1933; well until 1958 I was basically all the time in Amsterdam. My family was a worker’s family, my father was a waiter, a restaurant waiter, my mother did some work in hospital. Life was not always easy and of course from 1940 to 1945 there was the World War and the Netherlands were occupied by the German Nazi troops. So we had that experience also. So even after the war, of course, things were a little slim. Because of course everything had to be built up again.";374;Family/Home Environment
But so how did your interest in science then begin? Was it at an early age at school already or did it come later?;Paul J. Crutzen: Firstly, I did quite well in school. It was easy for me to learn, especially natural sciences but also languages. I was early interested in languages because my father was very good in French and he wanted to show this off on me so, we had some competition in that way, you can almost say. And my mother was born in Germany so I could speak German pretty good.;374;Creativity
So you were multi-lingual from the beginning?;Paul J. Crutzen: Yes, I was basically from home to bi-lingual, but then through school and through contacts with my father also French and then English and later of course Swedish when I moved to Sweden. But natural sciences I became interested in, I don’t know how, it’s just by reading books and the first books maybe were about explorations you know, the people, the Jules Verne books, the stories about the march to the North and to the South Pole and so on. And I remember at home we had a fantastic picture book about Yellowstone National Park, it was black and white of course, but that book fascinated me so much and things like that pushed me sort of in the scientific area;374;Personal Characteristics
Then I understand that you did not immediately start to work in science, you were educated as an engineer from the beginning and also worked as an engineer as I understand it?;Paul J. Crutzen: Well ,subject which I was also interested in was bridges, of course in Holland you have plenty of bridges. So, that I read a lot about. When I did my final exams for entrance into the university, the last year of our high school, I was very sick and had to do my exams with very high fever over a two-week period and so I had to do it that way because if I didn’t do the exams I would have to wait another year. So, there were no other opportunities.;374;Creativity
But then you also moved to Sweden after this period of studies I realise?;"Paul J. Crutzen: I met a Finish girl on the mountain top in Switzerland. She was vacationing and I was sort of hiking in Switzerland and we started corresponding and I visited her and then in 1958 we married and then we decided to move half way between Finland and Holland and that is Sweden, and I learnt Swedish, which is a reasonably easy language to learn. It’s not very difficult, the grammar is relatively simple. So I worked in a house construction company for about 1,5 years and then I saw an advertisement by the University for Stockholm, Meteorology Department. They were looking for a programmer, computer programmer, and although I had no background in that area and … but I thought well must have something to do with mathematics which I liked very much.
I applied and among quite many candidates, they picked me for some reason. That was my big luck, because I then started working at the Institute of Meteorology of the university as a programmer, but they allowed me to go to courses in mathematical statistics and then meteorology, very theoretical courses. Because I could not afford doing the more experimental courses which take time, you have to spend a considerable amount of hours in the lab and I couldn’t afford that. One of the reasons why I became a theoretician is because of practical reasons.";374;Creativity
So this is when your interest in atmospheric chemistry rised in this environment of meteorology or did it come later?;"Paul J. Crutzen: It came later and initially I studied as I said mathematics, mathematical statistics and then finally I decided, let me try out meteorology. I must say it was a little bit of a shock because mathematics is so clean and mathematical statistics … and meteorology is a very much also an intuitive science. You have to bring in, you apply of course the laws of dynamics and thermal dynamics, but then there’s so many … the system around us is so complex, you have to be very, very intuitive to pick the right things.
And at the Institute after a while, and it’s about 10 years or so, well a little less than 10 years, I became a programmer for a US scientist who was coming to get his PhD at the Institute of Meteorology. So I did the programming for him, the subject was always ozone, was one of the first models of the virtual distribution of ozone which we developed. And while I was doing that I started studying photo chemistry and I got suddenly fascinated and in spectroscopy and so on. That became then my … and one of the very important things I found out is that people just repeated themselves. It is obvious that, these sentences that this and this is true.";374;Creativity
Yes of course. But this is an interesting question: Did the society immediately see the serious consequences of this just because you were a scientist’s projecting something or that was accepted?;Paul J. Crutzen: That was surprising. It was surprising because I mean the ideas were on the table and very soon of course no measures were immediately taken. The industry was hoping to build these planes. But it was clear that major studies had to be conducted before this expansion of the aircraft lead would take place. And we did several years of research, three or four years on this topic. But at the end suddenly there came another problem which already existed namely the release of chlorine into the stratosphere and by the chlorofluorocarbons gases.;374;Advice for female scientists
Why is that so? Why do they grow up can you explain that in simple ways or?;Paul J. Crutzen: Well, it’s not so simple, you need a blackboard to write some equations down. If we only would consider the chemistry of the nitrogen oxides and indeed ozone would be depleted everywhere. However, low down we also have the emissions of hydrocarbons from automobiles but even more by force and it is the products from the oxidation of the hydrocarbons together with the catalytic action of NOx which then creates ozone and of course you need sunlight. That’s why the photo chemicals were mainly due in summer on the very stable conditions when hydro carbons can accumulate in the lower atmosphere and also nitrogen oxides, then you get these. But this was known already for say Los Angeles area but one did not consider that these reactions basically take place everywhere.;374;Advice  for young scientists
And would that be enough to heal the hole do you think?;Paul J. Crutzen: We cannot do more. There have been, it will take 30 even up to a 100 years before the ozone hole will have disappeared. But that’s … nature must have its way now because the chlorofluorocarbons gases are so diluted in the atmosphere that you cannot just take them out and destroy them. It’s too late. And all the ideas which have been spread around so far on mending the ozone layer have been totally unpractical. And mostly many of those are also lounged by former military laboratories who wanted somebody to save the world. But nothing practical.;374;Life
Another a worse problem perhaps. So then maybe we should spend a few minutes on the greenhouse effect and your opinions about the carbon dioxide problem and what’s your opinion of our future there?;Paul J. Crutzen: We have still … maybe you can repeat the question … We have still one, you asked me at the end, have you forgotten something and that of course is one thing that we should also talk about and that is nuclear wind.;374;Environment
And how could that happen then? Does one know that now?;Paul J. Crutzen: What we had not considered is that ice particles which form in the stratosphere at low temperatures below minus 80 degrees that on these ice particles reactions take place, which lead to the conversion of relatively stable, we call it reservoir molecules, into very aggressive chlorine atoms and chlorine monoxide radicals which attack ozone very efficiently. And the formation of the ice particles is a, you can almost say natural, process, that is dependent on that’s what is happening over Antarctica because it’s simply cold in winter time, early spring. But the reactions on the ice particles involving chlorine, they are of course coming from human activities.;374;Impact of Nobel prize on you
You mentioned one other thing you wanted to speak about when we talked about is different scientific topics. I had also another question about what is your major interest right now so to speak, but maybe you want to bring up this question to begin with?;"Paul J. Crutzen: With nuclear wind, well, one of the things I have been very much involved in the past with studying the effects of by a mass burning in the tropics on atmospheric chemistry. It’s normally assumed that the tropics is a very clean part of our environment and people go on vacation to the most wonderful places and of course they are not thinking about pollution there. However, pollution is not only created by industry but also by mass burning and that is happening a lot in the tropics. We have deforestation activities, we have people burn just to cook or they burn to get rid of stubble or old wood or old plant material so they burn everywhere. In the Savannah regions of the world of the one about every year half the area is burnt to get rid of the high dry yellow grass which is not very fancied much by cattle for instance.
So this is a lot of pollution coming into the atmosphere in the tropics so that has been one scientific activity of me and related also to human activities but out of that and my interest in that came totally by chance one day thought that maybe the fires which would be raging following a nuclear war a major nuclear war in cities and oil refineries etc bringing large amounts of soot into the atmosphere. What that would do to the radiation balance of the atmosphere and what we found out and that was actually, that work was initiated by an invitation by Ambio, a Swedish journal issued by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. They asked a number of scientists to think about what would be the environmental consequences of nuclear war. Initially I didn’t want to participate in this study. I thought well a nuclear war everybody’s killed five or six times over and I was in the belief that this would be true, but then finally I realised this is not true. You can kill one person or a number of persons six or maybe even more times over really, theoretically, but people are spread all around the world.
And you cannot wipe out human race just by nuclear war, you can make an awful world, but to wipe out humans altogether is a story which is not true. But then one day when I thought about it what is happening when all the soot gets into the atmosphere from heavy fires deposited higher up in the atmosphere and then we found out that would block sunlight from reaching the earth’s surface and we then would create almost something like an anti-greenhouse effect in other words that, because of that, the earth’s surface would cool very strongly and the higher layers up into the atmosphere where the soot is were warm.
So you get a temperature profile which is totally opposite to what is usual when it is warmer low down than higher up. So you turn it the thermo structure of the atmosphere upside down. And of course photo synthesis is reduced under these circumstances, then additional this became a big international study and additional facts were found for instance that temperatures at the earth’s surface may go down below freezing and that of course would be even during summertime this could happen. And that would of course then be disastrous for food production and so on. So suddenly this idea that mankind or a large part of it could be really at risk by nuclear war suddenly became a hypothetical reality.";374;Motivation
When I was briefed about you and your work from one of the people at the Nobel Museum in Stockholm, they said there are a number of people who have done great jobs who have received a prize, but one of them who has made the most outstanding contribution is Professor Rowland. And it was in the work that you have done regarding the environmental issues. How do you feel when people are saying something like that?;Sherwood Rowland: I do think that the question of the chlorofluorocarbons in stratospheric ozone turned out to be a very important problem. We didn’t plan it that way but that’s how it turned out. And so it has for many people become a symbol of what the environmental movement can do and I agree with that. The Montreal Protocol is an agreement among many countries and it’s actually working.;376;Meaning (Values) of Work
But do you feel it’s a burden almost or is it an excitement to carry that, you have been part of something so big?;Sherwood Rowland: I think it’s more that that was part of my life and I certainly don’t regret it. I enjoyed it while we were doing it because it was very exciting science. And to have it work out that we have, the Montreal Protocol was added to it, that it was recognised and acted upon.;376;Creativity
Were you already then interested in environmental issues?;Sherwood Rowland: I’d been interested, I wouldn’t say, in one sense I don’t think that I came into this from the environmental camp. I came into it from the scientific side of an interesting scientific problem of what would happen to these compounds which … they’re man made, they hadn’t been in the atmosphere before, they are very useful technologically and one of their major technological advantages is they don’t react with very many things, in fact almost nothing that they react with. And that’s a technological advantage and it’s the fatal flaw in the earth’s atmosphere is that the only thing that happens to them is up in the stratosphere, relieves chlorine atoms, chlorine atoms attack ozone and you have a problem. And so you can’t go on doing that. You have to quite manufacturing and using these compounds. So there was beyond the science there was political and environmental questions that had to be faced and over a period of time they were.;376;Motivation
But have you become more interested in environmental issues? Are you being …;"Sherwood Rowland: Once we got into this then we began … the laboratory that I set up … I was an experimental chemist so you have a laboratory, and we set up a laboratory to measure chlorofluorocarbons and other molecules in the atmosphere. And if I may say so we have a very good laboratory, and as a result if you collected air sample in Southern Chile and you bring it back and you analyse it, we can find out how much of chlorofluorocarbon-11 is in it. We can find out how much of 200 other molecules are there. And you’ve already collected the sample, you’ve already analysed it, and that takes you into studying of other things that are going on in the atmosphere.
We began to measure for example methane, which is also influenced by man but it is not an industrial product in the general sense. It’s a product of molecules that are released in rice paddies, they’re released by cattle, many other uses. And that becomes … and methane is an important greenhouse gas and so we’ve been measuring that now on a global basis for about 25 years. And then you keep on looking and there are other interesting molecules in the atmosphere relative to what’s going on in Chicago or Oklahoma City or Beijing or Tokyo. And so we have become clearly working on the environment but working on the atmosphere as it exists in various places. And that makes you aware, frequently this turns out to be an environmental problem on a local basis or maybe a regional basis or global. And so you start worrying about how you cut off these problems before they become something that takes effect in cities all over the world.";376;Motivation
Of course what we see by the thinning of the ozone layer is that it’s a man-made problem to a large extent. Can we as human beings reverse that? Can we repair it? Can we do something?;"Sherwood Rowland: In terms of reversing it, nature will take care of that, and I don’t see any way to do it faster. And nature will not take care of it rapidly. They major molecule that’s involved, there are two major molecules, but the longer lived of these two is dichlorodifluoromethane or fluorocarbon-12. Its life time in the atmosphere is about 100 years.
And just to make sure what life time means, it means that at the end, about 1% goes away every year, but what that means is that at the end of a century then 37% of it is still left. And at the end of two centuries there’s 15% and at the end of three centuries there are about 6%. So we’re not going to be free of dichlorodifluoromethane for several hundred years. But we will have rapidly, not rapidly, but progressively less as we go through the coming centuries. Fluorocarbon-11, the other major molecule, has a life time of about half a century. And so it will go away somewhat faster, but will still easily measurable quantities for hundreds of years into the future.";376;Environment
Would you advise young students to get into this field? I read somewhere that we only know very little yet about the atmospheric field.;Sherwood Rowland: I would encourage young students to get into something that they find very interesting, whatever that is. And there are a lot of interesting environmental problems. There are some where you can, if you clean up the air in your own city you can see the result fairly quickly. In India for instance, in Delhi, in the last several years they’ve made a remarkable improvement because they have switched away from diesel fuel for trucks and taxis and three wheeled vehicles. So the people in India that are working in Delhi can look up and see blue sky where they didn’t have it before, and they can certainly get a feeling of satisfaction out of that, as well as having solved the scientific problem along the way.;376;Advice for young researchers
But do you think we as human beings on this earth could have changed quicker, we could have other kinds of use energies, different kinds of cars, if there was not enough pressure?;"Sherwood Rowland: No, on the question of the stratospheric ozone question has been treated a reasonably satisfactory solution about the best that we could has been reached. And we know that this Montreal Protocol is working. Global warming on the other hand is a continuing problem and it’s one that not everyone is facing. Most countries are not really facing the real magnitude of what that problem is.
The Kyoto Protocol that was agreed, negotiated in 1997 and has gone into effect eight years later, meaning this year, and not everybody clearly in the United States has not agreed to it. But the Kyoto Protocol is just a bare start. In order to reduce the effects of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we need not to get rid of six or seven percent of the carbon dioxide, but more like sixty of seventy percent. And since carbon dioxide comes from burning coal, gas and oil, that means that we have to be working very hard on all of the opportunities to find energy substitutes from burning the carbon fuels.";376;Role of Science
When you received the prize, were you surprised? Had you expected it?;Sherwood Rowland: The answer to that is no, I hadn’t expected it. One is sort of aware that it might be considered but the Nobel Prize is rarely given for someone that does work that’s outside the laboratory, amidst physics and chemistry. And whether the destruction of the ozone layer was counted as chemistry or physics or geophysics. If it were geophysics then it probably wouldn’t be eligible. So for much of the time when we knew that it was getting a lot of attention, wasn’t it at all clear that it would qualify for Nobel consideration.;376;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Did it in any way change your working life?;Sherwood Rowland: Changed it in some ways. I think for many Nobel Prize winners the change in their life is that they become a public scientist and that happened for Crutzen and Molina and myself back in the middle seventies when the destruction of stratospheric ozone became a front page topic. Then we started doing things like this, of doing television interviews or talking with newspaper and magazine people. So that aspect hit very hard in the middle seventies and again in the middle eighties when the Antarctic ozone hole appeared. So having been a public scientist for a couple of decades certain things weren’t so different. But clearly the Nobel Prize is widely recognised and honoured and it’s sort of as though your name has just been changed. It’s not Sherwood Rowland, it’s Sherwood Rowland Nobel Prize winner. And that certainly is a difference.;376;Impact of the Nobel on you
What was it in your life that made you want to become a scientist?;Sherwood Rowland: I was always good at mathematics and science, but I don’t think, I really don’t think that if one went back to when I was a college student, I majored in chemistry. But I could have imagined if something had come up one might have gone off toward journalism or something of this sort. But I did work for the college newspaper. Maybe if somebody had come to me then and said we want you to do this I would have been side tracked in that direction and who knows? But I went to graduate school in chemistry and found that I was fortunate at the University of Chicago to have been dropped into the middle of a hotbed of outstanding science from people that had come out of World War II with scientific projects to work on, now that they were no longer working on military projects. And that was a very stimulating time period. It became not at all difficult to say this looks like this would be a good career.;376;Motivation
Here in Lindau there are many young people who would like to talk to you, who are here because they are outstanding in their own fields. How do you feel about meeting these people? Is it exciting?;Sherwood Rowland: I think it is interesting to tell them and to listen to them … when I was in their position that was 50 years ago and a lot of things are different. So that some of the things which if I describe my early years as after I had my PhD it’s like coming from an alien world for them because it is so different from the way science was organised in the time period, 1940s, 1950s.;376;Advice for young scientists
"family background and early education; his discovery and the Nobel Prize (5.17)
I’m sitting here in Lindau in Southern Bavaria, this is the 50th anniversary of the Lindau so called Nobelpreisträgertagungen and I am sitting here with George Olah who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1994. I would like to ask you first, Professor Olah, could you tell us a little bit about how and why you became a scientist.";"George A. Olah: I was born and grew up and lived in Hungary until I was 29. When I was growing up and going to school, I must confess I had absolutely no interest in science. As a matter of fact it never crossed my mind that science would be an area I would be involved in. I had much interest in history, literature, languages, even philosophy. At the end of World War II, in war-devastated Hungary in central Europe, when the time came to enter university, it certainly became clear to me that I’d better try to get into a profession that I also could make a living. When took my first chemistry class I fell in love with chemistry – don’t ask me why because I can’t explain why you are falling in love, but I am still in love with it. It’s maybe disappointing, but I was not one of these wunderkind who at age ten already knew exactly what he wanted to do and studied /- – -/ before this.
Maybe I should mention Eugene Wigner who was also a Hungarian born physicist. I read once he wrote about his life and when he was finishing high school his father was a businessman sat down with him and asked what he wanted to become. He said that he would like to become a theoretical physicist and his father, who I guess never had heard of theoretical physics, answered ‘And tell me how many jobs in this little country of Hungary are for theoretical physicists?’ His son, who was an honest guy, said ‘I guess two, maybe three.’ At which time the conversation was terminated his father enrolled him as a chemical engineer, but later on he shifted gears.";377;Life
The question is, of course, when you were out driving the car and you realised that you’d cracked it, you know that was it, you know you’d got it, I mean, what was it that made it and what was it that led you to that?;"Kary B. Mullis: Well, it was, you know, it was typical of a really interesting development in that I was looking for something else, and PCR was the possible outcome of a solution to a hypothetical problem that didn’t really exist. I mean, I was working on trying to sequence the single base pair, you know, I think they’re called SNPs today, single nucleotide polymorphisms, because those were medically important and I was trying to do it with all nuclear tides because I ran a lab that made them and we had really improved the efficiency with which we made them over the three or four years prior, so that we could make them a lot faster than the company, Cetus, that I worked for could use them.
I had seven people working for me and I was thinking, well I’m either going to have to cut the staff down to like about three, because now we’ve got these little automated devices that will do that, or I’m going to have to increase the demand for oligonucleotides and so I started thinking of what else can you do with them. And I thought it’s possible that you can make a rapid clinical essay for single base polymorphisms like sickle cell anaemia was a good example. That took, back then, maybe going to a clinic and take a sample and maybe three weeks later you’d know, which is a lot of agonising, kind of, and I thought, you know, it would be nice to have that in one shift in a hospital, kind of go in and they’d let you know, and I thought oligonucleotides maybe were the answer there, but I was a chemist, I still am a chemist, and I really didn’t have an appreciation for the hugeness of the human genome compared to, say, a 5,000 based plasma that I was using as a sort of a model system. And I was thinking of this method that would require a couple of oligonucleotides and one of them would sort of be a control, but they would be pointed, like, toward each other just like in a PCR reaction and I was thinking of how am I going to get rid of the excess of the axinucleotide triphosphates or something.
There was a couple of technical problems I was trying to solve and one of them, the way I decided to solve it, was to like run a sort of sham reaction first with the oligonucleotides in place and the sample and then I add my radioactive traces and stuff and run it again and this was going to use up the … it was just not for the idea at first, duplicating the signal, but then I realised the side effect of that was going to be that I was going to double the signal if there were enough, like, the axinucleotides available. I was trying to get rid of those if there were any coming in with the sample.";378;Creativity
Do you think, a danger for many young students and scientists today? They have brilliant idea, brilliant minds and then, you know, particularly today when so much is driven by commercial interest, that if they’re not careful, they might lose out?;"Kary B. Mullis: Well, you know, if you really are in it for the money then science is not the place, because generally speaking, you’re not going to get filthy rich being a scientist. I mean, once in a while some people do but it’s more likely that you’ll end up being a professor in a university, it’s not a bad job. But, you know, industrial scientist isn’t all that bad even though they won’t grant you the rights to some, maybe, you know, most people are not going to advance something that’s going to make a lot of money anyway, you know, so these days I would say if I was a student, I’d probably do just about the same things. I like the industrial kind of, like at Cetus they did have some good things. One of the good things was that they said 10% of your time you should do whatever you want to do.
That was a sort of, most people didn’t pay much attention to that but I said, you know, it’s hard for them to measure what 10% of my time is so I can use as much of my time as I want to for my own sort of just curiosity and that was a nice thing and then if you wanted some piece of equipment or something, you didn’t have to wait two years, like, for a government grant to come through and get funding and all, you know, there’s a lot of red tape involved in government for your … and stuff, which I’m dealing with now because the nice thing about a government grant is you keep everything yourself. I mean, if you come up with something interesting you patent it personally and so I’m doing that now and I’m going to probably be looking for, actually I’m not looking, I’m sort of screening investors now because I’ve decided to take some private money.";378;Advice  for young scientists
You’re working with research now in an institute with regard to children’s health, am I correct?;Kary B. Mullis: I have a position at the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, but that’s one of the places where research is going on on this idea that I had some time ago about how to design drugs that would engage an already present immune response that a person had. Like, you’re immune to a lot of things already and when you get a new disease, it would be nice to just tap into a present immunity with a pharmaceutical that would take that immune response that you’d already made for one thing and turn it against the pathogen that you’d just been infected with. That sort of like would be the ideal way rather than having to say new pathogen, it’s going to probably take 11 or 12 days for me to get immune to it, my immune system has to figure out if this thing is actually bad or not and then it’s got to figure out how to deal with it and all of that takes a long time and sometimes the pathogen wins, like a really serious case of an influenza, like the kind of thing that happened in 1918. That killed about 30 million people in 18 months.;378;Research
May I ask how far you’ve got into this research?;Kary B. Mullis: Well, we’ve cured a couple of diseases in mice and rats and we’re now going to try the approach in, we’ve got these kind of mice that are minus the enzyme that makes this thing called alphagalapatose, they’re kind of like people in that regard. We don’t make a particular kind of chemical and we’re immune to it. It’s probably something that happened maybe 25 million years ago because chimps and orangutans are the same way. We’re allergic to just anything that makes up a one-three alphagalbon which is probably real common in pests that we started eating somewhere 25 million years ago so we started being immune to it and I’ve got some mice now from somebody in Australia made that have that same thing, so they can be immune to it, so they’re kind of like, otherwise there’d be these experiments on chimps. So we do them in mice and we’re going to try to protect mice against the form of the flu that was prevalent like in 1957, the Asian flu they call it or something like that, or the Hong Kong flu and if it works there, then we’ll go to rather a deadly strain of the flu that’s now circulating in southern China, in Vietnam and Thailand.;378;Research
May I ask if your research would have any implication on the race that we have now for finding some kind of vaccine for the HIV and AIDS epidemic?;Kary B. Mullis: It would be perfectly useful. It’s not like a vaccine in the sense that it doesn’t make a new response. It takes one that’s already there and using …;378;Creativity
I would like to come back to the issue of the award, the Nobel award. Was that a kind of, for you, having done the discovery you made and then when you got the prize, was that some kind of feeling of justification but also that your knowledge and your idea was finally acknowledged and that you got some kind of, you know, payback after having …?;Kary B. Mullis: There is nothing like getting the Nobel Prize. I mean, there’s just nothing quite like that as far as I’m concerned. By 1993, I didn’t need any confirmation that this was a useful thing because every time I’d pick up Science or Nature or Cell or any scientific kind of magazines, there’s not only articles that are using the technique but there’s full colour, full page ads for the equipment to do it with. It’s pretty hard these days even to find an issue, in fact you couldn’t find an issue with Science or Nature or Cell or, you know, PNAS or anything that didn’t have lots of people using PCR.;378;Impact of Nobel on you
But did you wait for it? Did you think, ok, one day I will get it, or did you think, ok, no?;"Kary B. Mullis: No, I really didn’t think that much about the Nobel Prize except for the fact on the night, then I thought ah yes. I told my girlfriend. I said, you know, this is the kind of thing you get the Nobel Prize for. This will change DNA chemistry, you know, for a long time and she didn’t take it very seriously but I didn’t think of it too much after that until years later somebody, my mentor when I was in graduate school, Joe Neilands called me one day and he said something like if you’ll start talking to the press about all kinds of issues and stuff, and I was starting to talk about AIDS … because they were using PCR to detect it, the HIV molecule, and I was going to a lot of those meetings and I was thinking these guys are on the wrong track and they’ve got blinders on them in a sense, he said if you just stop that, you know, you’re probably going to get the Nobel Prize but they don’t have to give it to you until you’re dead; I mean, they don’t have to give it to you until right before you’re dead, so make it easier on yourself and just, I said you wouldn’t stop talking about something that you thought was important, would you Joe? And I knew he wouldn’t because he had been a real activist against Vietnam and that kind of stuff and that was the one thing I learned from him, was that scientists had a responsibility.";378;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Do you feel that after you got the Prize, that you have had to, I mean, is it more responsibility, not just as a scientist but also as a Laureate, to bring up issues of importance, things that you, I mean, environment issues or other issues that you feel very strongly about?;Kary B. Mullis: I don’t think I’ve felt any more responsibility. I’d already felt some, you know, but I don’t feel, for instance, like it’s necessary for me to get involved in things that I don’t know anything about and have an opinion on those things. Like, I noticed in the symposium the other day here where every single member of this channel talking about climate change and stuff, introduced himself as saying, well I don’t know much about this, I’m not an expert in this field. I would feel kind of funny standing up and saying, I don’t really know anything at all about AIDS, I haven’t read any of the papers and stuff, but here’s my ideas. Like, who cares? You know, on that issue, I said I’ve read all the literature, I’ve read more of the literature than most of the people that I’ve listened to at this meeting and most of the people who consider themselves to be experts haven’t really spent the time reading. I love to read, so there are some things I have opinions about.;378;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What do you, when [young people] come up to you and ask you what field to get into, what would you say? What would you advise them?;Kary B. Mullis: What interests you now, you know. If you don’t really like it, there’s no real reason to go into it and there are a lot of people that like it. If you like, you know, more chemical kind of things, get into the biochemistry kind of stuff. If you like dealing with more biological stuff, that’s, you know, I mean, this sounds stupid but, you know, you have to follow your own interests. If I really was doing what I’m doing now because I felt like I should or it was helpful for the world or anything like that, that would not be sufficient reason to sit there and every time that, you know, there’s four or five journals that come to my house, some of them once a week, some of them once a month, but I read them all the way through and that takes a lot of effort and then I try to digest that and then I write research plans and stuff that needs to have absorbed that kind of stuff. It’s a lot of effort and I do it for fun now. I don’t do it for, it would take a lot of … I don’t know, if you don’t really like science, it would be a dumb idea to go into it. There’s a lot of other things out there to do.;378;Advice for young scientists
Many Laureates actually are sons and daughters of immigrants. Did they encourage you to go into higher studies?;Rudolph A. Marcus: I think that was the sort of atmosphere in my family. Now, I’m not sure if you’d regard the following as encouragement, but when I was a baby in a carriage, we lived near McGill University and my mother used to wheel me around McGill University and tell me that I would be going to McGill University. I suppose that’s a form of encouragement.;380;Creativity
After McGill, what happened next?;"Rudolph A. Marcus: After McGill, there was a chance of applying for a fellowship to go to France and of course that would give one a chance to see Europe. It’s true, I’d been to Europe before, because when I was six months old my mother took me to see her parents and her family but I didn’t remember much from that time. So this would’ve been a chance to see Europe but somehow I felt I was kind of frivolous, you see, and so when somebody came down from the National Research Council of Canada, which was just beginning a post-doctoral programme, the NRC, as you know, in Ottawa, just beginning the post-doctoral programme, came down to seek people to apply for fellowships.
It was before the fellowship programme so we were called junior research officers you see, but we were doing the same thing that later on fellows did and so that was such a natural thing, so I sort of just drifted. In fact, I think all along, up to my first few years there, it had really been just sort of flowing, drifting and not sort of thinking great things or what have you, just flowing naturally. I mean, for example, there was no question I was going to be in science earlier on, but there was a question was it going to be math and that terrible statics in physics? Or whether it was going to be chemistry, so it ended up being chemistry but of course eventually it was the kind of chemistry where I was able to draw on physics, and that played a big role, androns, a little mathematics.";380;Creativity
There is one special thing about today because today, the 26th of June, the year 2000, there’s been a joint announcement by groups in the United States and in Britain and elsewhere about the first published, I would say almost draft, not completed, but the human genome is now sort of put officially on paper, so that everyone can study it and read it and look at it. And there has been even a joint discussion between Bill Clinton and Tony Blair about this event and so I can say that this is a major event in the history of mankind, actually, not just science. Would you like to comment about this?;"Rudolph A. Marcus: Yes, of course everything in that field is far from my own, but one thing has been clear over the years, is how much biology is drawing upon chemistry and physics so that in a sense biology has become so much more molecular and now with the human genome project and the business of understanding the genes and understanding disease on a molecular basis, you know, I think the future for young people is just immense. I mean, I know a little bit about certain narrow corners of biology and I’m excited by those corners, so imagine with a broad area.
One of the wonderful things, and of course the Nobel committee has recognised this, one of the wonderful things is how some of these complex structures had become known, determined and of course to understand some of these biological processes, or understand any chemical reaction, you have to know something about structure as a starting point. Now in chemistry, for simple molecules, that’s well understood. I mean, automatically we assume we know what the starting structures are and the final; we don’t know the intermediates, that we learn about but the starting we don’t. Well before this, in the biological area, as you know, not much was known in detail about structure but now so much is being known. Like, for example, the prize on photosynthesis and how that fitted into the detailed studies of reaction mechanisms involving photosynthesis, or the transfer of energy that’s picked up from the sunlight to this photosynthetic reaction centre, the structural information there, or very recently with the prize for the ATP synthase, how nature’s smallest rotary engine, I mean what a wonderful device, what an exciting device to have in one little sort of unit. An ion current going across, an electric field being applied, something rotating and in the process forming ATP, which is such an important agent. And, of course, these rotary motors and linear motors are sort of ubiquitous so I mean there’s surely plenty of excitement.
I know there are already quite a few experiments, of course, but I think that things are just opening up. What we have learned so far at the basic level for basic understandings has so many potentialities for applying to these more complex systems. You know, are we going to be able to use the same rules or is there going to be a kind of simplification, for example, of protein folding? Is somebody going to come out with something which says, ah, you don’t need everything at this complete level of detail, but this is the broad outline and if you understand that, you have understood a … I mean, I have no idea, it’s not my area, I don’t know, but I think there’s so many possibilities. Of course, that’s one area, ok? And certainly the genome is going to expand it into molecular medicine, which is already very active, but of course there are other frontiers where physics and chemistry and mathematics meet, you know, and construct all sorts of the nanostructures, molecular computers eventually, goodness knows what. I think it’s exciting for young people to have these opportunities, but of course there’s been excitement for a long time. Many of us were excited by it. Yes.";380;Meaning (Values) of Work
Dr Richard Ernst, welcome to this Nobel interview. You come from Zurich and from the very famous school there, University ETH where also Albert Einstein have studied for about 100 years ago. But today you are very critical to the way the university function in the society. What are the major drawbacks in the university system?;Richard Ernst: I was just two days ago giving a lecture in Luleå in the north of Sweden and I was showing a transparency of the gentleman you just mentioned, Einstein, and he said it’s one of the greatest miracles of mankind that after 20 years sitting in a school bench one still can maintain some creativity, and I think that’s indeed one of the problems that we try just to listen and to accumulate knowledge without doing anything and some of the students, and also the professors, have lost contact with reality. I mean I might express it in a little bit too extreme way, but I think it’s a tendency and we should try to get more into contact with reality.;381;Environment
What do you mean by contact with reality?;"Richard Ernst: There are different aspects. First of all, I mean there’s the necessities of life so that we all end our research projects to what really mankind is needing the relation between North and South between the super-rich and the super-poor. That’s one aspect and the other aspect is that we also try to develop more responsibility for what is going on in the world. In the moment the world is so to say governed by politicians and by industry and both they have urgent problems to solve.
Today to survive for tomorrow and I think we need somebody who is looking more into the future on long term and I mean we have been granted freedom to do essentially what we want but whoever has acquired freedom he also has to accept responsibility. So we have essentially to do what is needed to be done and this is long range planning. Long range planning on a global scale that we really try to develop new concepts. How can we safely survive also in the future?";381;Competencies
So you mean this would be a task for a community of scientists all over the world?;Richard Ernst: Yes, exactly, that’s true. Not a single individual can do that. We don’t need specialists for that. Political science of course it’s important of futurology or whatever you’d like to call it that’s fine to have a few specialists but I think everybody should be concerned and one needs to collaborate and work together in order to develop new concepts and it means essentially that we have to work as a scientist on two levels. First of all we have to do our detailed work, we have to concentrate on our details and go as deep as we can into the ground, deep and deep to the foundations so that we have solid foundations to build our future on. But on the other side we should also work on an upper level and develop bits and foresight and have global views for what is going on in the world. So these two levels they should essentially work side by side.;381;Role of Science
Why do you think that scientists can be, what do I say, better moral leaders in the world than other people?;Richard Ernst: I mean they are not … but again what I said before, politicians for example they are so much in their business and they can’t afford, I mean they have to survive personally in the next election for example and business people they have profits and the shareholder value is so important that they can’t have this long term vision so I mean universities are essentially left for taking such a job. Of course we are not particularly well suited for it perhaps because we are so specialists and have been trained as specialists but still I think we are those who should develop these ideas and especially because we are actually training the leaders of the future.;381;Competencies
What do other people, your colleague scientists, say when you tell them that you have to take more responsibility for the long term thinking in the world?;Richard Ernst: Yes, yes I mean they say it’s nice talking it’s easier to talk about it than to do it but that’s, I ‘m aware of that and they don’t completely disagree, but they try to ignore it.;381;Environment
What about students? Are they broad minded?;Richard Ernst: That’s true, the students, if I talk like that in front of an audience than the students that would come to me and say “Oh that’s great and we thank you for these ideas” I mean that’s exactly how we feel. So the students they are very motivated for that. The professors they just see their own limits.  But the students they would like to get more involved in that. You see it’s so difficult today to motivate young students to go into the sciences. Chemistry in particular. We don’t have enough chemistry students but I mean if one would combine the detailed science with the broader view I think we could also motivate bright young students with the broad mind to study natural sciences again.;381;Advice for young scientists
Why do you think that young students and people don’t go into sciences today?;Richard Ernst: I think one reason is that it’s become so specialised and so detached from the human interests. I mean if you are married it’s so difficult even to tell your wife what you’re doing and she might not care and might not understand and doesn’t want to understand. So I mean you need something in common with other people as well to be part of a community otherwise if you are just a group of specialists, of course I have friends everywhere in the world in different cities who understand me and who understand my language. But I mean you need also people like that in your immediate environment.;381;Motivation
Did you have any idea that this apparatus would work in this way?;Richard Ernst: Not really. At the beginning I didn’t see the power of it but I mean it was always my goal. It was my goal to develop something which could be used afterwards and in essence I’m not really what one would imagine to be a scientist who wants to understand the world. To understand how the basic principles of a human being, I was more interested in really designing tools. So I’m a toolmaker and not really a scientist in this sense and I wanted to provide other people these capabilities of solving problems.;381;Research
Was this the motivation for you to go into the university and study chemistry to be useful for the society?;Richard Ernst: Not really. I mean initially I once discovered in our old house a box of chemicals when I was 13 and I started to play with this box of chemicals and I survived and our house survived and so I became very interested in this phenomena, this strange phenomena of chemistry and at that time I really wanted to gain understanding. So at that time I had more scientific motivation. And for this reason I went into chemistry but later on I developed more in that direction of a toolmaker.;381;Motivation
Let me ask you first of all, you are the son of an immigrant. Did your family encourage you to go into education?;Sidney Altman: Yes, my family felt that the pass to advancement in the new society that my parents had come to was through education. That education was the means to understand new things, to understand the new world they were in and to enable their children to do better than they had done. And some of the older relatives in my family were teachers of one kind or another so it was not so out of the question to think so highly of education and the value of education.;383;Environment
And they didn’t push you in any special direction?;Sidney Altman: No, I feel very fortunate about that. That they didn’t impose what their views of what might be the best things to do. For example many kids who were in the same situation I was in were encouraged to go into medicine or law because they were very secure professions. And I never had that kind of constraint put on me by my parents and I felt free to choose whatever I enjoyed and whatever I was interested in.;383;Family/Home Environment
How did you become interested in science by the way?;"Sidney Altman: I have of course been asked that question frequently and I try to remember it correctly but it’s always hard to know if you remember the past correctly, let’s put it that way. I recall a few incidents. And one of them may not be so exciting in terms of the rest of what the world may perceive as something that interested me, but I somehow knew about Einstein when I was growing up as a kid. I think I had been given a book, short biographies of great men for children, and I was six years old when the atomic bomb was dropped to end the Second World War in Japan. Naturally the whole world was full of the news. The newspapers were full of pictures. The story of the bomb and how it was built was written up everywhere. And the role of scientists and pure research in generating the ideas and then the success of the bomb were clearly laid out at that time and a direct connection to Einstein, although he might not have wanted it to be so direct, was there.
So as a kid I was impressionable, being young, and this made me feel that science was very important. At the same time I was interested in natural phenomena. Obviously if I didn’t have both sides of these things going I might not have pursued it. But I would say in terms of the specifics of science, when I was about 12 years old somebody gave me a book to read, and I can’t remember who it was. It was written for I would say kids or the layman and it was called Explaining the Atom. But the significant thing I remember in it was the periodic table. A very lucid explanation of the periodic table and how Mendeleyev formulated his ideas and even more important the notion that Mendeleyev was able to predict the properties of elements that had not yet been found. And to me that was absolutely amazing when I was 12 years old. It was so elegant. So beautiful, that I think it was at that time I decided really to try and study physics which I went on to do. And so that was the beginning, I think, of my real interest in science.
I switched to molecular biology later on, from physics. And I do remember actually reading one paper when I already had my Bachelors degree in physics. I just came across it one day in the journal Nature. I wasn’t looking for it because I wasn’t knowledgeable in the field of molecular biology. It was a paper on the nature of the genetic code. It said that the genetic code is read in groups of three letters from DNA essentially. And it was a paper from Cambridge England and Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner were the senior authors. And I remember thinking to myself, not merely this is again very elegant, beautiful, but thinking to myself how could they possibly have understood this. How did they find this out? It seems magical that you would be able to say something about the way we are encoded in a sense in nature. And that stimulated greatly my interest in molecular biology as a discipline also. I thought it was something I’d never heard of before. Something I wasn’t really in touch with. I’d heard about DNA. I knew a little bit about it but to be able to do that kind of experiment I thought was amazing.";383;Motivation
It’s striking when you read the autobiographies of the Nobel Laureates that many of them started out in a field very different from where they ended up. I sometimes sense that youngsters of the day are a little worried that they start out in the wrong field and they will get trapped there. Would you like to say something about that?;"Sidney Altman: Well, I think that I’m not sure that I would include myself in this statement, but a lot of the people who for example are at this meeting are extremely imaginative and curious people. And I think people like that will always be looking for new challenges and new ideas that are not necessarily established ideas in their own field or derivative ideas from things in their own traditional disciplines. They will always be looking at the borders of knowledge. And one can’t predict exactly where that will take you. I think that’s part of it. I don’t really want to get into a sociological analysis of today’s students but in my particular field molecular biology, I will say that it was not really a field per se for example when I went to university. So that everybody who came into it before that time and about the same time as I did had to come from another field. There was no training in molecular biology.
Today, because of the success of modern molecular biology, every university department has a department of molecular biology or called something else maybe. But similar. And you have a lot of people going into what is now an established field. And a lot of these students, as you say, do it because they know there are jobs available at the other end. And that’s what they want. And there’s nothing wrong with that. A lot of people go to university for security and a profession and that’s fine. But one hopes one still gets the occasional student who has that restlessness of intellect and curiosity to want to go on and do research.";383;Advice for young scientists
Today, the 26th June 2000, is a very special day in a way that a joint group of scientists from many countries have announced that they have completed and also published at least the first version of the human genome. This is of course is a major step in the history of mankind and history of science. Would you like to comment on that?;"Sidney Altman: I think there are several important things to say about the actual announcement which I just happened to see when I was taking a little rest before. And it was very interesting for a number of reasons. First of all let’s talk about the science. Of course if you are in molecular biology you knew this was coming. So it’s not striking or surprising that this stage has been reached in our knowledge of the genome. I thought that during the talks given by various people today it was clear that they are trying to be very careful about the practical implications and the timeline for fulfilling some of the practical promise of this knowledge. We have to understand exactly what all this information means. We have a huge amount of information in front of us. We don’t know how much of it is relevant to the everyday function of the human body. We don’t know at the moment. But I am perfectly confident as are the scientists who have been working on this project that within five to ten years, perhaps even sooner, we will know a tremendous amount because of this information. About how the human body works. That is to say in comparison to what we know now. We’ll know much, much more. And it will have a very major bearing on our understanding of human disease and probably give us new insights into treatment of disease.
Now I’ve made some great generalisations just now and I’m probably not the person to become more specific about it, except to say that I think I agree with you it is a milestone event and it is important but it will be a few years before we derive the benefits. But that’s not surprising. It happens with every major scientific advance. I also want to comment on some other thing that were said and how the announcements took place because I think they’re almost equally important. There were two factors in addition to the science that I thought were important. One was the fact that you had the political chiefs of two of the leading countries of the world. Leading in terms of advanced technology, financial comforts, standard of living and things like that. The Prime Minister of Great Britain and the President of the US participated in a joint transatlantic television conference which in itself is interesting. And both these heads of state were clearly knowledgeable about the advance. They seemed to feel at ease talking about what it meant.
But what it meant to me was that the political establishment in both countries and all the other participating countries in which there are several, therefore the people the societies themselves, were behind this whole enterprise. This is one of the few times I think in history where so much has been devoted by so many countries in a truly international effort with the political heads of all the countries behind them to participate in this project which will benefit mankind in a great way. And I have to also say that both heads of state and the other scientists who spoke did speak about minimising the potential harmful effects that might arise from this new knowledge. The use of the information for example. As an aside I will say that Mr Blair used that word minimise. He didn’t say you could make zero the potential negative effects. He said minimise which I think is the correct way to put it.
The other aspect of this announcement which I thought was very interesting and very significant in many ways, in the States you had accompanying the President the head of a large commercial enterprise which was involved in producing this information as well as the head of a government lab. Actually the head of the international human genome project. And they clearly had reached before this announcement an agreement about how the information was going to be used. How the commercial enterprise would be able to benefit from it but still work together with the public enterprise to make the information available to everybody.  Now we don’t know the details of that agreement yet but I think it is significant that after a few years of rather bitter wrangling supposedly this conflict between funding of private research and public research has either come together or been ironed out with some kind of compromise which will allow everybody to benefit from it. I think that’s also very important because governments alone cannot do everything. They cannot support all research. And this is one case where the private sector has been very energetic and ambitious, and so it’s significant that, in the end, it’s worked out its differences and terms of intellectual property sharing with the government. So that’s my rough reaction to today’s announcements.";383;Meaning (Values) of Work
On a more lighter side, I noticed that in science there has now been a kind of betting scheme on how many genes there are in the human genome... Would you like to make a bet on how many genes there are in the human genome?;Sidney Altman: Well, the low numbers are very interesting, because the other genomes that have been sequenced recently, for example the fruit fly, Drosophila, and some other bacteria, the nematode C. elegans, have all turned out to have fewer genes than we thought that they would have. However, a mammal is different to some extent, and so I’m not willing to make a wager, but I would say fewer than 100,000, and I also repeat a comment that we heard earlier today, made by one of our colleagues saying that predictions are very hard to make, especially those about the future. I would hedge my bets there.;383;Meaning(Values) of Work
How on Earth did you feel and what did you think about when you sat there in the lab and saw all these results coming out that could only be explained in mechanism that no-one would believe in?;"Thomas R. Cech: We ourselves did not believe it for more than one year and I was working very hard and encouraging the people in the laboratory to work very hard to find a protein that we were sure must be responsible for the RNA splicing and …
Thomas R. Cech: It wasn’t there and we kept getting evidence really that it wasn’t there. For example, we would take the RNA preparation and we would subject it to detergent, which is very bad for proteins, and the splicing reaction continued unabated and we would boil the solution, which normally denatures and unravels protein chains and again, the splicing reaction continued after that treatment. So the system kept trying to tell us that there was not a protein but for a long time I refused to listen and kept urging people to look harder for that evidence for the protein.";384;Creativity
But you must have thought of the risk of being ridiculed when you came out on the stage, in the open air, with all those results. Were you, by the way?;"Thomas R. Cech: Not immediately. The world was sort of waiting for this result because Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel and others had speculated about such a possibility in the mid-1960s. I’m embarrassed to say I had not read those, I was too young, I had not read those papers and I was unaware of this, but others, who were more senior, were still thinking that maybe RNA could tell us this would be perhaps important for the origins of life and that the fact that the ribosome was composed of partially RNA seemed to many people to be a hint that RNA had a very primordial role in catalysis.
Now, since there were no examples, that had sort of faded away in the meantime but once we provided this evidence, there was really great excitement. I think the fact that we did the experiments in this obscure organism, this pond animal Tetrahymena thermophile allowed many people to think of this as a curiosity rather than something that would be central to biology, so that perhaps also prevented us from being ridiculed. We said Oh this is a weird organism, it does weird things, it’s interesting but we don’t have to incorporate it into the centre of our thoughts.";384;Creativity
But there is a very exciting mechanism that I want to know something about inside now. I mean, how do you really break down a paradigm? Because that was what you did. I mean, how do you function as a scientist to be able to do that in the first place?;"Thomas R. Cech: You have to, of course, have an open mind and you have to have very rigorous experiments and you have to be your own worst critic. You have to be so demanding to get very sharp proof yourself, in your own laboratory, that by the time you announce it to others; they have to accept it because you’ve done things so carefully.";384;Creativity
Yes, but how come that your mind is starting to think of something that no-one else thought of?;"Thomas R. Cech: Well, as I said, we were a bit slow to come to that realisation. It took a full year and you just … As a scientist, you get hooked on these questions and you’re thinking about it all the time, you think about it in the shower in the morning; you think about it in the middle of the night, you think about it when you’re riding your bicycle and you just keep turning over the possibilities and the important thing is to recognise that there could be other explanations.";384;Creativity
So now this is 15 years ago, so there must have been happening a lot since then. What is going on in the field now?;Thomas R. Cech: The important thing for what we called ribozymes which means ribonucleic acid that has catalytic activity, and I think this was key to the Nobel Prize, was other people finding more examples because if it had only been the one example in this pond animal, I’m not sure the interest would have been so sustained. But within, well the next year, there was another example and then the year after that several more examples and then literally hundreds of examples of RNA catalysis in nature and that helped not only sustain the interest but increase the interest so that there actually started to be conferences on catalytic RNA. There was enough of a community that hundreds of people around the world were working on this and they would get together and talk and compare their results, so that was one development that we had no way of predicting but that was of course very exciting, for us and for the field.;384;Research
This must mean that all this talk about junk DNA and DNA that is not working or RNA that you don’t know any use of, it will totally change in the coming five or six years? There will be no junk left?;Thomas R. Cech: I don’t know. I think there still could be some junk. Much of the junk appears to be almost parasitic transposable elements which inhabit chromosomes and then have a strategy for copying themselves without damaging the ability of the host organism to function properly, so there could still be some junk but I think buried, you’re correct, that buried within what now appears to be junk may be some RNA transcripts which have activities that are not yet imagined.;384;Future research
Is there an equivalent perspective on the biosciences and the 21st century?;Thomas R. Cech: Absolutely yes. I think it’s already starting to happen. The completion of the human genome project was a wonderful event, but it was not an end in itself. It provides a tool which will allow the medical sciences to understand both healthy human life and also disease in a much different way than they were able to do before and we, as we learn more and more, we will learn that particular variations of genes that each of us, one person to the next has thousands of differences, some of which may be inconsequential but some of which may give us a resistance to a virus or a susceptibility to heart disease and as these are, the meaning of these differences is unravelled, then medical science will be able to use these to better diagnose and treat disease.;384;Role of Science
But how will it affect our lives? Will there be eternal life or will agriculture be something totally different?;Thomas R. Cech: I hope not in terms of the eternal life because if you remember the gods on Mount Olympus from Ancient Greek mythology, who had eternal life, they were wasting time and drinking and partying all the time. They did nothing useful with their lives because there was no time pressure, so I think that having, I think the fact that life is finite is what makes it so valuable and what gives us incentive to make the best use of every day.;384;Meaning (Values) of Work
But surely it will affect the way on our route to the final end? I mean, what will the journey look like when bioscience is ripe?;Thomas R. Cech: Of course, the dream is that people will live a healthy productive life, as many people are now, but even more people will be able to look forward to having a life that lasts for perhaps 100 years in a productive healthy manner.;384;Meaning (Values) of Work
What about the greatest riddle of them all, how life originated?;Thomas R. Cech: Yes. That one is fascinating to think about and one wonders if it will ever be solved because if you think about it, it’s not so much just as scientific question, it’s for historians to talk about, but how do historians normally ask questions about things that are that ancient? That are almost, you know, over three billion, perhaps close to four billion, years ago? You look for fossil evidence if you are a paleontologist and single molecules, such as RNA, do not leave a fossil imprint, so it’s very difficult to ask the historical question. Instead, as scientists, we try to recapitulate steps in what might have been a plausible scenario for the origin of life.;384;Motivation
But to get these answers, if they are impossible to get, you need people coming into science. Are there enough people coming into science in United States and also in Europe?;Thomas R. Cech: Well, certainly in the developed countries, we see a discouraging decrease in interest in sciences. In the United States, the only thing that is sustaining our biomedical sciences is an influx of very talented students from Eastern Europe, from Russia, from Asia, especially China, some from South America, from countries where people are hungry for opportunity and I’m afraid many of the American students have an easy life and this seems very difficult, to have to think about the scientific concepts, so we see a declining interest. It worries us a great deal.;384;Environment
But don’t you think that also the scientists are a little to blame because the idea of putting scientific knowledge in peer reviews or in scientific papers is to rip off all the emotions, to limit it to the pure knowledge and nothing of the excitement should be left in the paper when it’s in nature or science, so how can you ask people to walk along a street that lies in darkness when not even the people are walking there are illuminated?;Thomas R. Cech: Of course there are some museums which now do quite a good job of, I think, communicating the excitement of science and also allowing the public to play around with various experiments and have an interplay with an experimental system. There are some television shows and some web based activities. Now you can do virtual laboratories on the web where you’re actually mixing things together in a test tube and seeing what happens, so I think that there are quite a number of points of light around the world where people are doing some innovative things, but the overall picture is still that we’re not doing enough and that only a small part of the general public really gets exposed to these ideas.;384;Role of Science
What do you hope to get out of that?;"Thomas R. Cech: We recognise that biology has changed over the last decade and that technology, both computer technology but also instruments for peering into the function of cells, what we call imaging, to be able to see how molecules move and combine with each other and perform reactions in a living cell, that it’s very difficult to explore those areas in the best way in a university setting, because in universities, the biologists are in a separate building away from the physicists, who are separate from the engineers and the chemists are yet somewhere else.
And so technology and biology really need to be working more shoulder to shoulder and the university puts people in separate places who need to really talk to each other, so we decided to build a place where there was a single building with great horizontal spaces so that physicists, chemists, engineers, computer scientists could be working shoulder to shoulder with biologists and learning about what kind of technology was really required to drive biomedicine to the next step.";384;Future research
So small groups, a lot of money and people coming from all different sort of disciplines, putting them together in one place and make them talk, that is the recipe?;Thomas R. Cech: That’s part of the recipe. The other part is that we are very close to Dulles International Airport in the Washington DC area, and so we hope to have visitors from all over the world who come, because we want to share the things that we create. We don’t want to just hold them to ourselves. We want to make them accessible to the world, so we have built a hotel for 100 people and we have built 48 apartments so that people can come and stay for a month or six months or a year, and then the proximity to the airport should make it very easy for scientists to come from all over the world to join us there, to bring their ideas or maybe bring their problems, bring their samples to put in a microscope or to learn a new bioinformatics algorithm, so we want to have a very active visitors programme as well.;384;Creativity
So what will this laboratory have explained to us in 10 years from now? The secrets of consciousness?;Thomas R. Cech: Maybe the secrets of consciousness will be more 100 year goal, but one step towards that will be to unravel the network of neurons that are responsible for behaviour and we don’t want to, we’re ultimately interested in human behaviour but the human central nervous system, the human brain, is too complicated, so we will work with simpler organisms such as the fruit fly, the zebra fish and the mouse, that are genetically tractable organisms and also ones that are smaller so that we can apply this imaging technology, this advanced microscopy to visualise these neurons in action.;384;Future research
Along the path from physics to at least biophysics and biochemistry had you also had brushes with other branches of science? Had chemistry figured for instance at that stage?;Johann Deisenhofer: Not very much. I knew very, very little about chemistry and that was in part because among physicists at that time chemistry was considered a sort of a second-class science. You could hear people say Well, I mean, quantum mechanics describes everything and chemistry is the detail.;385;Creativity
Where does that leave biology?;Johann Deisenhofer: Pretty stupid point of view, but they were present, and so in the curriculum for budding physicists chemistry played sort of a very minor role so we had to take one course, I think, in the first two semesters and a practical course, that was it. Compared to let’s say, the math that we had to take at the same time, chemistry was indeed, or at that level was quite easy.;385;Future research
Do you think things are still the same when you study physics? Is chemistry still seen as a second-class subject?;Johann Deisenhofer: I don’t know. I hope not because it is not justified as I learned the hard way later.;385;Career Devleopment
And you found yourself very much at home with Robert Huber, what was it about his style of leadership that particularly appealed to you?;Johann Deisenhofer: He was pretty young, only a few years older than I was, I think six years older and was very liberal, modern thinking. He had many ideas to do things differently than his mentor as always and he, for example, introduced the custom to address him as Robert and not as Professor Huber.;385;Mentors (Role models)
And the resources were tremendous, I imagine, at the Max Planck?;"Johann Deisenhofer: Yes. I mean I didn’t pay attention to what things cost at that time. They had the modern machinery, the x-ray generators, even a computer controlled data collection, machines and so on and there was the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in another part of Munich which had I think one of the fastest computers in Germany at that time an IBM 370 something or 360 91 … I’ve forgotten the details but this was for anybody who had the calculations it was almost ideal conditions.
So I became a computer freak for a while at least and indeed at that time computing was one of the limiting resources in crystallography especially protein crystallography. If you look at the pictures of the beginning days of that field Max Perutz and his students. When they were collecting paper tapes … I mean this was really pioneering work with a very, very limited availability of computing resources. And luckily this is all changed now, our laptops can do a lot more than the IBM machine at that time could do.";385;Environment
Was that the norm for the environment you were growing up in?;Johann Deisenhofer: No not really. It had to do with my personal history. I was not meant to become a scientist. I was meant to become a farmer and when it became clear that I would never be a good farmer I had lost one or two, three years at school and I had to catch up and for some reason the German army desperately wanted me so I had to lose another two years in the Army or one and a half years but in practice this amounted to two years and so that explains why I was relatively old when I got my PhD.;385;Environment
Just referring to your childhood and the expectation that you would become a farmer. Are there, despite the fact that you didn’t follow the family path, are there the nevertheless familiarly aspects to the way you work?;Johann Deisenhofer: I enjoyed being on my own, being by myself. I certainly played with other kids and interacted but I had no problems with being on my own and that is still so. I think I enjoyed the occasions most when I had a well-defined project and I could solve the problems by myself.;385;Family/Home Environment
Having got your PhD and then embarked on post doctoral projects looking at the structures of a number of different proteins, you then had a momentous meeting with Hartmut Michel in 1982 when he revealed that he had crystallised a membrane bound protein. Did lights flash in your head at that moment and you thought this is the project for me?;Johann Deisenhofer: It took me a while because it was, at that time the larger protein the structure of each would be solved and it was not clear at all, there was no precedent whether the standard methods of structure determination would work and so I think everybody hesitated for a while but not very long. I like Hartmut because I knew him, I knew that he tried to crystallise membrane protein in a different group at the Max Planck led by Dieter Oesterhelt so we occasionally talked and then at some point it was clear that we would collaborate.;385;Life
It all moved quite rapidly at that point and you’ve written before about the fact that you were deeply excited to be involved with it and so excited that you couldn’t even sleep. Can you describe how it felt to reveal this structure?;Johann Deisenhofer: There’s one point in every structure determination when you can see the general idea of the protein. In this case the biggest question was how are the chromofores arranged in this protein? It has four chlorophylls, two chlorophyll derivatives and heme groups and iron and quinones and it has lots of those and the task of the protein is to keep these in the right geometrical arrangement so that the electronic properties follow from this. That was the most exciting point when I recognised in the electron distribution the chlorophylls and I immediately got hold of some models of, I mean atomic coordinates of chlorophyll molecules, and fit them in and it was very clear that that was correct.;385;Research
What was the biggest surprise about the structure for you?;"Johann Deisenhofer: Its symmetry. It was known from spectroscopic experiments that there was a, known is perhaps not the right way to say it, but some people proposed that there was a pair of chlorophylls in close contact and then there was a so called pheo-phytin that was the acceptor of the electron.
But only one and then a quinone and then a second quinone and there were all kinds of models out there in the literature that accounted for the pair and the pheo-phytin and the quinone and the second quinone but when we looked at the structure it was clear that there were two branches of chlorophylls and pheo-phytins that looked to the naked eye almost identical. They’re not identical they’re subtle differences in distance and in the protein environment but everybody was speechless at first about the symmetry.";385;Research
And you trusted your structure determination above any of the previous evidence yes?;Johann Deisenhofer: Yes. The electron density is obtained without any previous hypothesis. I mean you cannot manipulate the /- – -/ information of 50,000 reflections such that they wrongly produce a picture that come from your own preconception, that is impossible, luckily, so there was not always easy to convince more senior scientists that, I mean it’s not our fault that this protein has a symmetry. They all thought we had made it up to make it more, or may in their hearts they thought then it was never really said but it took quite a while for the whole field to realise that they have to live with the symmetric reaction centre.;385;Creativity
Those didn’t exist when you were doing these experiments and therefore that wasn’t a potential problem?;Johann Deisenhofer: The example you mentioned indeed came from a piece of software the apparently was never really carefully checked and it caused us a severe kink in a bright young scientist’s career yes. But it could have happened to us too but it didn’t.;385;Creativity
End of story yes. And having determined the structure of the reaction centre then you and your group moved centre stage. Was that hard to deal with?;"ohann Deisenhofer: Yes it was. It meant a difference in my way of working and in my lifestyle, because before that I went perhaps to two meetings per year and after the structure came out and it became known that we had a structure, we were inundated with invitations. So there was one year when I travelled to the States six times and it was really amazing how much interest that structure created.
And the most peculiar meeting was in a hotel near the Pentagon which apparently was organised by the Department of Defence and they were at that time trying to think about molecular electronics, and they thought Well, this is indeed a prime example of molecular electronics and there were these four star generals. It was a little strange yes and especially the selection of talks was very, very unusual. I mean there were some talks that were about things that maybe 200 years in the future or something that sort. It was more science fiction than science but I mention this only as an example.";385;Creativity
So this period of activity culminated in your decision to move away from Germany and come to Dallas which was quite a major move. What brought you to Dallas?;"Johann Deisenhofer: After my PhD I thought I might, and because at that time the situation of protein crystallography was not particularly good because this was pre recombinant DNA technology and the proteins were hard to get. The whole field stagnated for a while and the opportunities for young people. So I stayed at the Max Planck and I … for quite a while I was prepared to spend my whole career there and then came this success story and I was asked many times Would you look at the position at this institution, that institution. I seriously looked at two places in Germany and one of them was the EMBL had as a consequence that somebody at UT Southwestern got the news that I was looking for a job.
And so, out of the blue sky came a letter would you like to visit and look at the possibility to join the faculty and I did some research because I had no clue, it was called UT Health Science Centre at Dallas at the time. I had no clue but I got very good recommendations from people, especially a colleague who did his PhD in Houston and he knew quite a lot about UT Southwestern, so I decided to visit and there was a very stark contrast between the way recruiting is done here and how it is done in Germany. It’s essentially going from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market and that impressed me a lot. So I decided to come for a second visit and then got an offer and still to my surprise one evening I pick up the phone and I call the chairman of biochemistry saying Okay I accept.";385;Environment
You mentioned the question of learning how to recruit people and building a team. From your experiences of the people who recruited you and your own working methods, what were you looking for and what do you look for in people you bring in to your lab?;Johann Deisenhofer: People who have a clear idea of the general direction they want to go. People who, now I’m talking about postdocs or in some respect also students, people who are willing to use their own head, who are not waiting for me to tell them what to do and who are hard working I mean that’s almost …;385;Competencies
It’s the same problem on a different scale?;Johann Deisenhofer: It’s a different scale yes. I mean the main part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute is essentially supporting investigators all over the United States and some scientists are in other countries but what they’re doing now, their research centre in Janelia Farm is something of that sort. I mean they must find people who can work together and the whole idea of this new institute is to promote collaboration between small groups of scientists and multi-disciplinary approach and all the buzz words that you can hear all the time but essentially it goes down to hiring the right people and that’s a big project.;385;Creativity
So it could have thrown people on the wrong track for a while?;Johann Deisenhofer: Yes. It would have created a sort of not quite correct picture of membrane proteins so these were the competitors we knew about, but our project could hardly have gone any faster than it did. Perhaps nowadays of course it would go much faster because we would have a different technology that collect data and we would synchrotron radiation. We had that at that time also but it was still a wilderness trip to go to synchrotron.;385;Creativity
So staying with the theme of structural biology for a while, do you think that the discipline itself and indeed the way that structural biologists are contributing, is changing?;"Johann Deisenhofer: Yes I think so. When I was young it was a very young discipline still and you could still fit all the protein crystallographers into the ballroom of a small Austrian village which happened actually, yes. But nowadays the field has become very, very large. We talked about the structural genomics and I have the feeling that the job description of structural biologists changes, that institution who hire new faculty, new researchers look for people with a lot broader perspective than just, let’s say, crystallography. On the other hand crystallography the methods have been streamlined to an extent that one doesn’t need to know much anymore. So I’m talking about computer programmes, I’m talking about data collection facilities at the synchrotrons.
The number of synchrotrons has increased and essentially we will soon be at that point where we send the crystals by mail and get data back through the Internet. This opens of course a certain risk that, I mean, crystallography’s still a complicated subject and on the other hand, if you can’t follow, you can go through the motion and get a structure. There will be cases in which people who are not experts go through the motions and think they get a structure, or the computer offers them a structure but it may not be the right one. So at South-Western we have tried to start an initiative with a core facility where well trained expert crystallographers offer their collaboration to anybody who’s interested. They provide training and in the essence they provide expertise and a reasonable assurance that all the necessary precautions have been followed to exclude the possibility of wrong structures and so on. So I think that could be a very popular model actually. Of course you have to find the right people. As far as people who are doing their individual research projects, I think, as I said before, there will be more and more requirements for much broader approach to biological problems then just one technique.";385;Research
So the problem with providing structures as a kind of service industry in the same way as you might provide DNA sequencing or something is that once you have the structure that isn’t really it. You need to understand more about the derivation and, so it has to be a collaboration, it can’t be a provision? And these structural biologists gathered in the ballroom in an Austrian village which is a beautifully European conception, they were crystallographers pure and simple?;Johann Deisenhofer: Yes. I mean they were, at that time crystallography was the most difficult part of protein structure determination. I mean you had to be a computer programmer, you had to be skilful with your hands, and you had to be very, very careful to keep track of what measurements you made and so on. I mean, as I said before, the computers were a huge bottleneck so you really had to know a lot about crystallography to do that job and the people I mentioned in the ballroom many of them were physicists, some chemists Max Perutz was a chemist and you could clearly see from where they came from. I mean do you know Michael Rossmann. Michael Rossmann was obviously a physicist and he was into developing computation methods.;385;Creativity
Compared with what size for the crystals …?;Johann Deisenhofer: When I joined Hoover’s group in 1971 I was very disappointed that the crystal was slightly under a millimetre and that means a factor of 1,000 in volume. Because in my physics time I was working with ruby crystals which you could buy and you could specify the size and so we often used 10 by 10 by 20 millimetres or so just to make them easy to handle. One can say through my career I have used smaller and smaller crystals and at some point the whole thing must end at a single molecule but that of course is the dream of the people who want to build the free electron lasers and the, I mean, extremely powerful next generation of synchrotrons and I don’t know whether I will live long enough to see that.;385;Creativity
It’s a nice dream to hold though. The last thing I think that I’d like to ask you about is to return to the question of what the Nobel Prize meant for your work and indeed your life outside of work. You’ve mentioned that there was a slight hiccup in research productivity. In terms of benefit, what do you see as the most tangible benefits of the Prize?;Johann Deisenhofer: There were two let’s say categories of benefit. One funding and the other one on my internal attitude towards work and towards science and if I start with the latter I really could, I was much more relaxed. After the whole ballyhoo had died down I was much more relaxed than I was as an obscure researcher because I could tell myself, well if I accomplish any more the rest of my life, at least I’ve done something quite /- – -/ so that was good. And funding was of course easier to come by. It has a definite affect. People don’t like to say no to Nobel Laureates so easily. I mean they do but …;385;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Yes because you mentioned that there were no financial pressures when you were working at the MPI that, for instance, nobody was going to turn around and say, you can’t crystallise membrane proteins, so you can’t do that project. And that free funding environment must be very liberating?;Johann Deisenhofer: Yes it is but of course, in principle there could have been the Hartmut Michel’s boss or my boss and we could not have done much about it. And I would say it’s not necessarily unlimited the funding in Max Planck. It looks great but on the other hand the groups are much larger and I think less streamlined than the research groups in America and so the groups in Max Planck they tend to become, or at least some of them in Martinsried tended to become worlds of their own, I mean independent, and they became reluctant to interact with others and so on and here we don’t have the money to maintain a group of 50 and it would be an enormous nightmare for me if I had, I mean so I’m perfectly fine with a much smaller group and more interactions with colleagues.;385;Environment
Today and during the Lindau Meeting there are many opportunities for young students to meet great scientists. What does it give you?;Robert Huber: I like to interact, to speak with students, and I just like to encourage them to approach me and the other Laureates. We have the forum sitting on the stage. We Laureates are lecturing and I very much hope that the students afterwards come and question us about what we have said and other things. In meeting us I can see the ease for the students, very much so. They do come – 500 this year from all over the world – that’s very good.;386;Creativity
Is it important for young students and scientific researchers to have role models and do you have a responsibility, do you think, as a Nobel Prize winner?;Robert Huber: I have a responsibility, as an academic teacher I would say, that is not much different from what I do at home at my university or as a visitor to other universities, to speak about my field of science and tell the students that this is interesting, it’s worthwhile to pursue, and to convince them that they work in my field. This is what I do here too. Perhaps it’s a more mixed, more international audience than what I usually have at home or at some universities I visit. So I like it, I must say.;386;Mentors (Role models)
Were there times when you were a student or back when you were working where there were failures in your work and you maybe felt despair and you had to have a role model? How did you then go about it when there were times which were difficult maybe in your work?;Robert Huber: You always have that, clearly. And I had excellent teachers. I studied in Munich, chemistry, and I had wonderful teachers in physics and in chemistry, inorganic and organic chemistry, so they were my heroes. The students right now are perhaps a little more to the earth.;386;Creativity
Can you remember a specific time when you faced some difficulties and it was just sheer hard work?;Robert Huber: I do remember that. It was when /- – -/ I considered giving up my study of chemistry. There was some practical work in technical chemistry which I didn’t like at all and I did not succeed with some of the experiments and had to repeat them and repeat them a second time. I was an excellent student with the best marks and there was a failure. And I felt very miserable concerning myself because it was a failure in a field that I didn’t like.;386;Creativity
When you were given the award, people said that if there was a possibility of recreating this artificially, one can solve the world’s energy problem. Where are we standing at that point?;Robert Huber: No, I never thought that. It’s certainly not the case. We learned a lot about biology. We learned about physics as well – the physical principles behind biological reactions. But it had no consequences in technical application. So we learned a lot about the method and instrumentations and techniques that we had to use to solve this problem, which was a crystallographic problem. And these methods are then applied to proteins of very different sources and very different biological function. And there is a very clear applied aspect – all those proteins that play a role in disease processes. And there is, as I see it, the future of pharma research and drug development.;386;Future research
What would your message be to a young student? What is your opinion? How can one encourage people to go into this field?;Robert Huber: The young people certainly want challenges. They would like to work in the forefront of science and we, the Laureates, try to convince them that work in biology is in fact in the forefront and it produces, even with simple experiments, often unexpected results opening new avenues for research. So to bring that forward there is so much to be discovered, in particular in biology, where we just have scratched the surface of an understanding of the biological phenomena. And on the other hand there are the methods available, an enormous development in methods that we have now available to study biological phenomena. So I would encourage them to study biology and work in biology. There’s so much to be discovered.;386;Advice for young scientists
Would you like to get the general public and companies and others to support the scientific world and the young students in a different way?;Robert Huber: It very much depends also on the media, you see, to bring forward that message that science is fascinating, it is rewarding. It is necessary for countries like ours, like Sweden and Germany – there are no natural resources except our brains – for these nations. So to bring that forward also the media can help.;386;Environment
What is your greatest memory from your time as a scientist?;Robert Huber: I can tell you what was very important for me as a student who had just finished his first exams and started to work on a scientific problem – which looking back right now was a very minor problem, but at that time it was important – it was a small molecule a Nobel Laureate was working on and a famous professor associated with him. I joined them as a diploma student, aged 22 or so. And I did a simple experiment and found that they were wrong, they made an error, an essential error, suggesting the molecular shape of this molecule incorrectly. And I could correct them, you see. This was great – I, a nothing. All of this was then very friendly and they liked what I had done. But, for me, it convinced me that I could achieve something and it was very decisive for me to stay in science.;386;Life
You’ll have a short talk with us here today. It’s a few years now since you received the prize, in chemistry. What is it today that you have use for in what you discovered at that time or what are you using, on a daily basis, in that discovery, so to speak?;Hartmut Michel: From the discovery mainly it broke down barriers that now we and other people, more and more other people, try to get structural information about membrane proteins. I work mainly all the time on photosynthesis for materials here, for the synthesis here occurs in this plant, but it also occurs in some bacteria in a more simple version and at the time I worked on that simple version it was good pleasure, because these proteins were nicely coloured and it makes fun to work with nicely coloured material instead of this usual whitish protein stuff.;387;Creativity
Was it then also easy in a sort of a way to explain what you were doing to make this structure and is it important to be able to explain what you’re doing in a sort of visual way?;Hartmut Michel: I wouldn’t say it’s easy. It depends also to whom you talk, but in general the prize had two major points. One point was that it was the first membrane protein, as I mentioned already, and to crystallise membrane proteins, when I started, was considered to be impossible. There was even a text book statement that it is impossible to crystallise membrane proteins and I thought this statement cannot be true and I worked hard in order to prove the opposite and at the end I was right and it was a lucky coincidence that I worked and I decided to work in photosynthesis, on the heart of photosynthesis, which is in the centre, of course, of the energy conversion which you get from the sun. So all that energy we have, apart from nuclear energy and maybe also a little bit of energy from the deep sea, is derived at the end from the solar energy so this is a very central process on Earth.;387;Research
And today, you’re continuing to work on the membrane proteins?;Hartmut Michel: I gave up mainly photosynthesis and actually I thought at that time that photosystem 2 is still pretty good to go. Photosystem 2 is the system which converts water into oxygen. And the oxygen is released as a waste product and all the oxygen which you have on Earth is derived from the photosynthesis and this kind of photosynthesis in evolution was established about maybe two billion years ago and I still think from the chemistry, to split water, to take away the electron centre and the proton centre, to take away the oxygen molecule, is a highly interesting reaction but I thought it so complicated that it will not make fast progress and I always told people that I will re-start with this difficult project after my official retirement but for the moment, other people made big progress …;387;Future research
You have mentioned that about 80% of the different drugs that are available on the market today for treating different medical disorders or diseases are working on these membrane proteins. What implication does that have on your scientific works and what is it that you want to achieve there in terms of new discoveries?;Hartmut Michel: Oh, actually my personal aim is to understand how these membrane proteins perform their function. What is their mechanism of action? What do they, how do they that? And when you know that, you also have some side, beside, projects and this can be used in uplight research and when you know the structure, say, of a hormone interacting with a receptor and when you know how the receptor converts the message and transduces the method to the other side of the membrane, then you can interact with the message and most of our diseases are simply caused by the fact that the messages aren’t getting from, either there’s no message or there’s a permanent message and when you know how the messages are converted, then you will be able to find compounds which stop the wrong message or which correct the message and this is what drugs in the end do and when we have this drugs knowledge, we should be able to develop new drugs against many diseases which, for the moment, cannot be cured or that the drugs are not specific enough or have harmful side effects.;387;Creativity
Could you give us an example where you can see it would be very, very useful for humankind?;Hartmut Michel: There are many, many diseases in the area but we work mainly now is practically each area of application. Asthma, inflammation, obesity, neural diseases … these all defects in the same kind of class of receptors and this class of receptors, it’s about, I said 58% of all drugs act on membrane proteins and about 60% act on one specific … membrane protein, so called G protein carbon receptors and we have not much structural knowledge. The rhodopsin in the eye which converts the light energy which detects the light energy and you use for vision is the same class of molecule. There we have structural knowledge since two years, it’s a related molecule but of course light is a substrate there, light is used there to trigger the reaction but normally it’s chemicals, it’s hormones, it’s neural transmitter for that. Mainly neural transmitters in the brains are used for the communication between the cells so many psychoses and Parkinson, schizophrenia, are caused by disequilibrium in these receptors in the brain and we would like to understand these better.;387;Creativity
So you can take a drug and then you eat something and it will have a different effect on you than it would have on another person, for example?;"Hartmut Michel:
That is one example and the other example is that many of these enzymes involved in drug metabolism are induced, they are not there if there is nothing to convert, and one example is grapefruit juice and grapefruit juice has many flavonoids and this compound induce enzymes which work for drug metabolism and when you have drunk grapefruit juice, you get these enzymes active. They are not there before, only a very little amount, so they are made and once you have consumed grapefruit juice, then your drug metabolism’s very different then from the day before. This is not only personalised medicine, it’s also medicine from day to day basis and this is difficult to…";387;Environment
That leads me to the kind of responsibility, you have mentioned, for example, that drug companies develop drugs to make money, it’s profit involved, therefore there are places on Earth where people do not receive certain drugs – we can talk about malaria, for example, it’s changing at the moment. In which way could people like you contribute to that discussion or would you like to contribute to that discussion to make it more clear, you know, if there are any responsibilities on that level?;Hartmut Michel: I think for the moment the big drug companies, they are clearly aware of their responsibility and they invest also in the tropical diseases, also malaria and I’m very optimistic that with our current methodology we will be soon able to fight malaria and I think one approach which looks for me very promising which was actually discovered in India is that malaria has the synthesised fatty acids themselves by a mechanism which is very different from the mechanism which your body, my body uses, so malaria has to synthesise fatty acids and when you block fatty acids, as it’s in its synthesis, the malaria causing organism is dead so I’m very optimistic for that. We know all now the enzymes which are responsible, most of the enzymes now and for that, we find out which are essential and I think the chance that we really can fight off malaria is very, very good.;387;Role of Science
What are the necessary qualities in a team building like that?;Hartmut Michel: Everybody has a separate project or a certain task within the project and when you are assigned a task, you have to think, you have to consider the education of the person, the knowledge of the person and also the behaviour, how the person would fit into a team.;387;Creativity
And your role?;Hartmut Michel: My role, I would say mainly I compare it with soccer playing and I’m now the coach, I’m no longer the player.;387;Mentors (Role models)
How do you view the difference between applied and basic science and what role does an institution like Max Planck Institute, where you work, have?;Hartmut Michel: If you look back, all of the discoveries which changed our life, improved our life, come out of basic research, not of applied research and that’s the reason why we have to go on with basic research, especially if you go to biomedicine and you look for single cascades in the body and for using and … molecules, then immediately when you discover and you’re into leukine or something like that or xylocaine which has a function in the body, stimulating the growth of a certain type of cell, then this immediately could become very important in medicine so the gap between basic research and applied research in biomedicine in basic, is very, very small. I shouldn’t even say it’s a gap, it’s a bridge.;387;Diversity in Science
And to be working at the institute like this, what is the driving force, so to speak?;Hartmut Michel: The driving force is the best is if people are really interested to get results and to get new knowledge and of course some people try to just to finish a PhD in order to have the title PhD but these are not the type of research students we would have like to have. Some people like to have the PhD chance in order to further their careers in business or somewhere else and we would like really the people who do the research to create new knowledge. They must have a very high motivation and on the other hand I should say in India the conditions are such that they have many, many students but only very few are allowed to go on to PhD thesis so the competition is very, very hard so their motivation to work hard is extreme, I have to say.;387;Environment
Is there a moment working in the lab, working with your wish of discovering new things, which was of major importance to you, that you can’t forget?;Hartmut Michel: In our field it was getting the crystal and especially I clearly remember the summer in 1981, July 1981, when I first discovered the crystal of the reaction centres in my numerous crystallisation attempts. This is number one. The second gap, then, is you have to show what the quality of these crystals is by X-ray crystallography, so when I did the first X-ray photograph and the crystal reflecting beautifully, it was quite clear that I had made the breakthrough and the rest was working it out. So these were the two moments – getting the crystal and showing that they reflect well.;387;Life
One last question – in which way did the Nobel Prize change your life, if it did, and would you like another one?;Hartmut Michel: How did it change my life? One point is that I got it at the age of 40 and this is of course pretty early and as a result of that, your lifestyle changes, not your personal life, like how you live at home. Say how you do, because you are now a person of public interest and this means that you are very often invited and people ask you for advice in society and politics, so you end up on many, many advisory boards. Advisory boards, supervisory boards, and you get many, many more requests and as a result of that, for quite some time I only could react, I could no longer act on myself and I would think if I would have gotten the Nobel Prize much later, I would have been a more successful scientist. I would’ve had much more time which I could have devoted to my research, to my own projects.;387;Impact of the Nobel on you
Welcome to the Nobel interview, Professor Jean-Marie Lehn. You are one of a few French Nobel Prize winners I would say. How did the prize change your life or academic work?;Jean-Marie Lehn: It didn’t change my work because when you are a scientist you have your own way of looking at things and the prize doesn’t change that so much. It may make you think about starting to change fields. That is possible. On the other hand, it changed life quite a bit. First of all one has more to speak about science and chemistry because of this resonance the Nobel Prize now has in the society, in newspapers, in media. You are supposed to be interpreter of science in some ways. To speak in more public occasions which we must do. One may or may not like it but one must do it because it’s a way to talk about your field. To talk about your colleagues. To talk about what’s going on in the area. Maybe more generally even to talk about what science is doing in society. And this is the most important I would say. I like to talk about what chemistry has been doing, which often is underestimated and very much neglected. But more generally I think just trying to tell people that science is part of culture. Not only literature and arts. Science is also part of our culture. It penetrates our life in practical terms even more than any other forms of human culture.;389;Impact of the Nobel on you
After the Nobel Prize, did you consider changing fields?;Jean-Marie Lehn: Yes, you consider it but you know, on the other hand I’m of the type where I like to deduce things from one another. So the field has evolved enormously. And in fact, what we are doing now has absolutely nothing to do with what I got the Nobel Prize for. But it is deduced from it. It came out rationally by expanding it and by going to other areas. It’s a total change in subject in the type of the things we are doing in the laboratory. But it is not a change in the direction. It’s an evolution which when you look back at it looks quite logical.;389;Impact of the Nobel on you
What kind of molecules do you study? All super molecules?;Jean-Marie Lehn: Life is short. And the day is only 24 hours. That is the problem. We would like to have days with many many more hours and life’s much longer. So you have to select things. So we started with trying to understand simple processes. The idea is the following. The way I started is sort of an inductive way. It starts from something small and you see it’s wider than you initially thought. And then you go ahead with it.;389;Research
When did you start?;Jean-Marie Lehn: 1967. 66/67. But it started in what you might call an awkward way. It didn’t lead to that. I didn’t call it super molecular chemistry at the start because you don’t realise when field is very broad you get the broad ideas only when you see what you are doing is more general than what you thought it was. So I was in fact interested in neuro chemistry which seems to have nothing to do with it. In fact I was interested in philosophy first. I wanted to study philosophy first.;389;Creativity
Philosophy of science or philosophy?;"Jean-Marie Lehn: Philosophy in general. Philosophy of knowledge. That’s what I was interested in. I was extremely interested when I was a youngster in the way we think. What is in there? Of course a fantastic problem. But you soon realise that I don’t think we have an answer to that. So let’s be more modest and study something where progressively we build up this area. At least approach it. And so I thought neuro chemistry, neuro system, has something to do with thinking so why not start there?
And then if you are a chemist you realise that the neuro system is extremely complicated and you cannot approach it like that. And one simple way of approaching it is to try to see if there is a process inter neural system which is simple and which one might have access to and might study. This is the following which I became interested in. In the nerve membrane the propagation of the electric influx, the neural influx occurs by pumping or by exchanging across the membrane of the nerves of two types of ions. Entities called ions. Potassium and sodium. That’s exactly how our nerves function. These run along like this.";389;Motivation
That was the backdrop to you somehow developing an interest in science as a child. Where did that come from?;Dudley Herschbach: Actually, I can tell you very specifically. I just had my 11th birthday and we were visiting my grandmother who lived, like we did, near the edge of San Jose. I always enjoyed going there because she had a National Geographic magazine, which of course was filled with beautiful photographs and all. This one had an article on the heavens above by Donald H. Menzel, Harvard college observatory ‒ this is way out in San Jose, California. It was certainly the first time I heard of Harvard and I wasn’t even aware of hearing it, but then of course … but had these gorgeous star maps with the mythological figures for the consolation super bowls, I fell in love with them. My grandmother gave me that issue because she saw how much I was taken with it, and I started making my own star maps and reading about astronomy and climbing up a tree we had in the backyard at night and I had a flashlight, it just clicked briefly, I didn’t want to light adapt my eyes, picking out the pattern I made and print pick the paper with patterns of the constellations. It just fascinated me.;391;Creativity
Was there an appropriate sort of structure to foster this interest, this burgeoning interest in science then?;Dudley Herschbach: Well, it was fostered. I was then in a little four room school, two grades per school. My graduating class from that grammar school was 11 kids, but there was a bookcase about this wide, about this high, and it had a couple of books, as my teacher pointed out, about the planets and all. Those were the first scientific things I read. Then of course our town had a little library and I began reading things there and I just got more and more interested in science. By the time I went to high school, of course I was interested in taking science courses and all, but even then, I wasn’t even thinking of going to college yet for people of my vintage and that social category it was not something you expected to do. But I was a good athlete and my coaches would say, “Of course you’re going to college”. Then my teachers began saying the same thing because I was a very good student, so then I began to realize, oh, I guess maybe I’ll try college.;391;Creativity
But the original impetus to come to go to college was coming from the sports side, a sports scholarship?;Dudley Herschbach: It was, yes. I was quite a good football player, American football, and in fact, when it came to applying to college, I got many telegrams, congratulating me on being admitted to colleges and universities I hadn’t applied to at all. I had not applied to them, but the football coaches would get their admissions committee to accept a student who hasn’t applied.;391;Creativity
You were a hot property at that point?;Dudley Herschbach: Well, any rate, I was offered several athletic scholarships, but back then, at least at Stanford where I went, the academic scholarship I was offered was more valuable than the athletic one, so naturally I took that. Now I doubt it’s true anymore, sad to say.;391;Environment
What’s a punter?;Dudley Herschbach: A punter is on fourth down. You have to kick the ball down the field or you risk … If you don’t make your first down of enough yardage, the other team takes over, so usually they punt. I didn’t like that because suddenly in spring practice they had all these other coaches telling us what to do. Whereas before the game really belonged to the players, that was a whole philosophy, coaches weren’t allowed to signal in plays from the sidelines, anything, it’s completely the opposite of what it is today, and so I said, “Well, hell, I don’t want to play that way”. Today it would be different if you have some talent to do well in a sport like football, you’d have to do it at least because as a decent player you get millions of dollars a year as a rookie, even in the pros.;391;Research
You were taken very early on by the idea of reaction kinetics and the field grabbed you. What was it that you found so appealing?;Dudley Herschbach: My freshman advisor was a young chemist that really I owe to the fact that in high school, the most outstanding teacher I encountered was in chemistry, even though chemistry, when I first encountered it in high school, mystified me. Anything else I started, it seemed obvious right away with the general idea the subject was and all, but chemistry looked to me a hopeless hotchpotch of odds and ends. It took a while before I began to get a feeling for it. I now, after years and years, have a way of explaining why I think a similar reaction with many people when they meet it in high school or college, you can come to that later if you like …;391;Motivation
That’s an interesting word to choose as a description for Bright Wilson ‒ an architect of understanding. Do you mean by that, that he was able to pull all the pieces together to create a framework for understanding?;"Dudley Herschbach: I’ve often said that people think science is essentially a technical thing. I think the kind of science we’re talking about is better described as architectural. An architect has to understand quite a few technical things, but not in the same way that the engineer or the building contractor needs to. Those technical things are not actually the essence of architecture. The way I think of an architect is someone who recognizes that at a particular time, the building materials and methods available allows them to create space in a way that’s shaped to not only be the practical sense, effective, structure to carry out its purpose, but it conveys something beyond that, that inspires people to realize that it opens their eyes to new possibilities that you didn’t anticipate would be there. That’s what really frontier science is like, it’s a human enterprise.
Often the exact content, I think, is not very important compared with how it inspires other people. I’ve often said that it’s the spiritual content of an experiment or theory that has the greatest impact, because science depends on how other people respond to it, just as in art. I think you value a great piece of art or a performance because in some way, having witnessed it, it changes how you think, how you react or what you do next. It is exactly the same in a fine work of science that the people who come in contact with it, they are after thinking in a different way. They probably do something different in their own work often and so on. Most people think, Oh, it’s just some technical thing and you do this or that, but there’s much more to it than that.";391;Mentors (Role models)
Why would one do anything else in life if you’ve got the chance to be wrong all the time?;Dudley Herschbach: Maybe it’s a temperamental thing. I often say to students that, what you want to find out as a student is some domain which appeals to you temperamentally as well as in terms of what seemed to be your special talents. That’s part of what the student needs to discover, by exploring different areas and all. What you want to try to achieve in your education is competence in some area and confidence. You need both those things and you want them in appropriate measures. If your level of confidence is much higher than your level of competence, that doesn’t work out well and vice versa.;391;Creativity
Do you think it would be hard to get support for the risky?;Dudley Herschbach: I think there’s no chance. If I wrote a research proposal in today’s climate that was akin or similar to what I was doing back then, that wouldn’t get funded. The whole attitude is such, you don’t find that anymore.;391;Environment
Why has that change taken place?;Dudley Herschbach: Partly because there are many more scientists and the whole business of proposals has changed character. Now it’s almost a commercial enterprise, what will come of this and so on. That wasn’t true way back in the late fifties, when we were talking about, when I got started as a young faculty member at Berkeley, it was okay to do something that was pretty far out blue skies.;391;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What was so special about him? What is this about him?;Dudley Herschbach: I met you Yuan Lee when he first came to this country from Taiwan as a graduate student at Berkeley and his English still wasn’t too good. It was wonderful to see his transformation, but, as it turned out, I moved to Harvard only a year after he arrived at Berkeley as a graduate student. He really did, as he explained to me later, want to work with me, but he misunderstood when I was telling him, because my general policy was always to accept any student who wanted to work with me. I felt I had a responsibility to do that, but I wanted to be sure since it’s a very important decision for them that you talk with other faculty and think of other possibilities. I always stressed this and then if they came back another time or two, then okay, I would be willing to let them do this reckless thing and work with me. But I think because of the language thing, he didn’t quite understand any …;391;Mentors (Role models)
He thought you were sending him away?;Dudley Herschbach: Yes, well I can appreciate it now, but when he came here to post doc with me, it was now at Harvard, he actually wanted to do theory because he had as a graduate student at Berkeley, done a beautiful off scale experimental work. I knew that Yuan was something super special as an experimentalist, but he really wanted to do theory because I was known for doing both theory and experiment, but he wanted to fill out his background. But he was too shy to tell me this. When I was ranting about, Oh, Yuan, the time has come to make this jump and build us new apparatus that will allow us to go beyond this limited family of reactions we had been able to study up till that point. Of course, he went ahead and did, that was great success. There’re about a hundred machines there in the world now that are essentially like the one that Yuan led construction of when he was a postdoc here.;391;Creativity
Indeed. On being a nice person, it’s not the image of the single scientist working alone, isn’t it at all? It’s community?;Dudley Herschbach: Yes, that’s right. Even the people like Einstein who are the iconic model for the lonely genius, it’s completely misleading. I’ve written a paper on Einstein as a student, who was for one of these celebrations in 2005 of his miracle year, and I looked into that pretty thoroughly and Einstein himself would say how much you owe to many other people. It’s very clear when you study his early years.;391;Environment
Could you summarize the approach to science that you’re trying to impart to your students? What do you tell them to do? How do you encourage them to approach the questions?;"Dudley Herschbach:
My basic philosophy is that science should be thought of as part of a venture of our species just as artistic things are. I try to teach science as a liberal art. To me that means the highest aim, as I understand it, of liberal art is to bring students to the habit of self-questioning, critical thinking, not just accepting what they’re told and all the rest. Science should be a very important component of this, and it’s not generally the case for most students who go through college in the United States, at least. Even those who are studying science don’t think of it as part of liberal art education for the most part, they tend to think of mastering technical stuff. The technical stuff certainly you need, no doubt about that, and it’s very satisfying to master some part of mathematics, particularly because it’s like a language, you’re empowered. You can do things, you can compose things, you can work out things and all you could do otherwise. It’s a very satisfying thing.";391;Advice for young scientists
Turning just for a little while to the collisions themselves, they allow you to study the making and breaking of individual bonds, which is sort of the basis of everything in chemistry. Maybe it’s too broad a question, but has that ability changed the way one views chemical reactions?;"Dudley Herschbach: Yes, I think it’s had quite an influence in the way people think, which is in the end for a long time. Chemists, as I alluded to earlier, wanted to map out these individual molecular steps, but they had no way of looking at individual steps and checking if that’s really what happened because, often you have what are called, intermediates ‒ they are so reactive. There’s a special, not very stable, combination of atoms, they’re so reactive they don’t stay around long enough to be observed by ordinary means. They’re postulated to be there maybe, and when you made deductions from what you thought the influence of that intermediate might be, you’d try to test it by varying the temperature or the concentration of reagents and seeing if things changed in a way that seemed consistent with a postulated presence of this intermediate species.
Often it didn’t agree with experiments, so you’d postulate something else. That was the way the game was played for a very long time. Of course, in addition to our ability to observe a single collision so we could see whether the step that was postulated took place more and more, you had other means to probe in particular laser techniques. Ahmed Zewail for example is a spectacular example in that he could follow reactions in time and trace them. Whereas the beam experiment is a different thing. Fundamentally, you prepare things that are on the molecular scale very far apart. They come in and interact very close together. They fly apart and you observe them and they’re far apart again. But what has happened in between is influencing the speed with which they come apart, how rapidly the molecules are tumbling, how they’re oriented in space, how fast the atoms vibrate, all those things you could observe was they’ve come apart.
But  /- – -/ you didn’t have a way to follow them all the way through in time, that was a very satisfying thing. More and more techniques have come along that augmented this ability to study the individual steps and detect in particular whether there are very short-lived intermediate species reacting intermediate in all the rest, probed what’s called a transition state when they’re really close together. Chemists also now have much better ability to compute from first principles from quantum mechanics what the forces are like. We have both better ways to test that and compute it but is not yet fully under control. Chemistry is charged difficult enough and complicated enough to keep you humble. We don’t understand all that we’d like to, new things keep being discovered, even in this domain we’re talking about, but of course, many other domains and frontiers of chemistry. It’s a very rich and ongoing enterprise.";391;Motivation
If one’s able to start defining the intermediate states, can you start to reclassify chemical reactions in terms of the intermediate states through which they go?;Dudley Herschbach: Yes, I always felt that what we needed to do and needed to aim at doing in this business of single collision, chemical reaction dynamics, was in a way to emulate what Pauling ‒ and he’s the label for this whole field of molecular structure ‒ understood in terms of electronic structure, because electrons are the key part of governing what goes on in interactions between atoms and molecule. We needed in these experimental tools to develop ways that we could connect the dynamics to the electronic structure. That’s what we were able to do in an observational way. Now theory allows you to connect it with quantum mechanics more directly, so that overall aim is being more and more approached and fulfilled along the way. It’s very satisfying to see how that works out, and every day we are getting a little bit further along,;391;Research
Just a last quick question. How do you solve the problem at school of people not being able to get the correct distance from chemistry to really get the picture early on?;"Dudley Herschbach: My short answer is you teach a liberal art. You realize it is that kind of thinking and you help them understand that our ordinary kind of conversations about many things have this character that is the level of approximation or abstraction in chemistry, that you use changes as you talk about bonding. One moment about terminal overall properties of bulk substances, another speed of reaction. They all have a different level of projection and approximation and vocabulary and all that. But the chemist in ordinary discussion goes back and forth, back and forth. fluidly. We do too in ordinary discussions of many topics. When you stop to analyze it, that’s the case. But when you are accustomed to a language, say like English, it’s a holy mess from a linguistic point of view, it’s a sloppy mixture of several other languages, and all the rest. Well, so is chemistry, and once you understand that you see, Gee.
I’ve been talking like a chemist all along, except I use different words and I don’t realize talking about people instead of molecules or institutions instead of molecular processes. But the chemist sees all these analogies and when you bring them out in teaching, I think it helps people to see. It’s so much fun to make connections. For example, one thing I love to do when I talk about the gas laws, a standard topic, you always have to discuss in the chemistry course. Suppose Hercules was confronted with a 13th labor to weigh the Earth’s atmosphere. Put it that way, because that’s a consequence, and a so-called gas law. Then I say, let’s figure out what the atmosphere weighs and it’s easy to do. Then they say, But that’s a big, big number.
How to make it meaningful? To make it meaningful, you compare it with something else. What else? Everyone knows that one atmosphere will hold up about 29 or 30 inches of mercury, that’s equivalent to 34 feet of water. It’s significant. How much pressure does that exert? It turns out that the pressure the atmosphere is exerting right now can be compared with how much you exert when you stand on the floor. We take your weight. We take the area of your feet and pressure is force pre unit area. It’s a gravitational force your weight, and it works out. You’re about 80 kilograms, more or less, your feet occupy about 400 square centimeters, and the atmosphere is one kilogram per square centimeter turns out. So if you take 80 over 400 that’s one fifth. You only exert one fifth of the pressure. When you stand up that the air does, doesn’t that make you feel lighter right away, you can dance practically. This is the way you say it to the class, it makes them see it in a different way. There are countless opportunities like this to teach chemistry as a liberal art. That’s what I mean by it.";391;Diversity in sicence
Welcome to this interview Professor. I want to start off by asking you a little bit about your childhood and what made you want to take the way to becoming a scientist. Was there something particular in your childhood?;Yuan T. Lee: I was born in Taiwan before the end of the Second World War, so when I was young, airplanes from America started bombing Taiwan every day. That was when I started my elementary school. So war certainly influenced everybody’s lives. And the bombing and airplane flying – all those scientific things came to our minds very early. But after the end of the Second World War Taiwan returned to China. At that time China was very chaotic. Very weak. Everybody believed there was only democracy in science would save China. I’m also interested in using my bare hands. And also the creations. So when I went to High School and read a book on Madam Curie I thought that it would be a good thing to become a scientist so that’s why I decided to become a scientist.;392;Motivation
That is interesting. I want to come back to that, but we could just briefly say that you did return. You went to America, you returned, and you’ve been back in Taiwan for 11 years now. Can you see these changes? Can you feel that you have influenced?;Yuan T. Lee: When I went to America in 1962 I didn’t plan to stay in America for so long. But after I got my PhD people gave me a professorship and it went on and on and before I knew it I found myself to be 57 years old and I had spent 32 years in America. I decided to go back to help because Taiwan needed my help more than California. So I did go there. Taiwan is a small place with 23 million people – a small island. According to physical law, if you push the acceleration is invert in proportion to the mass so Taiwan is relatively small. With many people returning to Taiwan from America, tried to push science and such a transformation, and it seems to be moving.;392;Environment
Which is the greatest challenge do you think for Taiwan in the field that you are working?;Yuan T. Lee: I think history goes through the democratisation. In 1996 Taiwan allowed people to elect a president for the first time in the history of China. So -96 was an important change. But by the year 2000 it was the first time the ruling party, which has been in power for 50 years, has been overthrown by popular vote. So that really marked another phase of democratisation. So when I went back, what I was really happy to see was the society become more democratic. So human power would be liberated because of the democratic process.;392;Future Research
You came back with a Nobel Prize and of course you have many students today and I would imagine that some of them are also going to America to do some of their research and then come back. How do you feel that somebody is going away for a while? Is it a loss for Asia?;"Yuan T. Lee: In the 1960s and 70s it certainly was a big brain drain. Many people went to America and stayed there. But now, during the last ten years, I asked many established scientists including the member of National Academy of Sciences, several of them returned during the last years to Taiwan. And so I would like to look at it this way: it’s the brain circulation. Young people go out and they learn something and then they come back.
On the other hand, the situation in Taiwan improves more and more students like to stay at home rather than go abroad. So now we are sitting looking at scholarships, who is supported, and sending them out to foreign countries. We really need them to see the world before settling down in Taiwan.";392;Impact of the Nobel on you
What did it mean to you that you were given the Nobel Prize back in 1986, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry?;"Yuan T. Lee: I was really surprised, first of all. I have been enjoying science with all my students and actually I’ve had some kind of record in America. If you look at the faculty member produced in major universities, famous research universities like MIT, Caltech, Berkeley or the Chicago or Cornell, I have former students in all those universities among the chemistry faculty. I learned that I produced more professors for American universities than anybody else. So I really enjoy doing science and by the 1980s we know that we are doing the best because we see many chemical researchers and many things nobody else in the world can do. So we are very happy that we are leading the world and people from Europe and Japan came to do post doctoral research. And as a scientist knowing that you are doing well is quite satisfactory.
But in 1986 I received an award from chemical society, /- – -/ White House. At the time I was a US citizen. They gave me the National Medal of Sciences. And then the Nobel Foundation gave me the Nobel Prize. At the same time Wolf Foundation in Israel also wanted to give me a prize and I was really surprised. Life suddenly changed. I was a very shy person. Even if I see a lady my face become red. I was very shy. But after the prize I had to be in the limelight so often to give after dinner speeches and then gradually I got used to it. But I remember during the first three months I suffered so much so my wife said ‘Yuan, you enjoy so much working in the laboratory with students, why do you have to become an after dinner speaker?’. And she suggested maybe we should return the prize to the Nobel Foundation and then you can go back to the laboratory.
 Well, that was my wife’s suggestion but I’m glad I didn’t do it since winning the Nobel Prize you have the different opportunities to serve different segments of the society. I went back to Taiwan and became the President of the Academy of Sinica in Taiwan. We run 30 different institutes in an assembly of academicians that belong to the office of the president. So I am certainly quite influential in Taiwan. I can talk to the President anytime I want. So I have been able to do quite a bit in Taiwan. That’s a good opportunity given by the Nobel Foundation.";392;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Is there any special memories that you have from the time you went to Stockholm that you would like to share with us?;"Yuan T. Lee: When I received the Nobel Prize people said ‘Yuan, you have to be a spokesperson. You have to speak for science. And people will ask you all sorts of questions that you don’t know the answer to but you still have to give the answer.’ That has been a big challenge for me so I studied very hard. Especially when I went back to Taiwan and took the position of the President of the Academia Sinica because academy cover humanity, social sciences, and physical sciences and biological sciences. As the President, as a spokesperson, I did learn quite a bit. So that was an exciting thing. Actually, Taiwan is a member of APEC, Asian Pacific Economical Corporation. Our president was not allowed to participate in APEC because men in China would not allow us to go. So I have been representing our president to attend APEC for the last three years. It was interesting.
First time I went there all the presidents of the countries of the pacific region including George Bush and all the people they are quite curious to see that a scientist, a Nobel Laureate, came to this political meeting and talking about economical development. It was quite interesting that they look at me in a very different way. As if I’m a different animal. Of course, for politicians scientists are very different. We all look at the things in the longer term. What is the truth? How can we do better? The politicians tend to think in short term. All they worry about is next year, maybe another election. They want to keep their position and so on and so forth. So that was interesting.";392;The impact of nobel on you
Definitely. That leads me to the next question which is about the environmental situation that we’re facing in the world today. You knowing so much about chemical reactions and so on, what do you think we are facing at the moment with global warming and ozone layer getting thinner? What is the reason for this and how can we as human being change it? Is it necessary for us to change the way we are living our lives?;"Yuan T. Lee: Yes certainly. Let me say this. Human beings developing on the surface of the earth in a biosphere for quite a long time. The earth is infinity for human beings. But 250 years ago after the industrial revolution we invented so many machines and used so much energy and people become so comfortable with the science advances. Population went up during the last century by /- – -/ now we have six billion people living on earth. So if you look a the development of the history of mankind last century we went through a critical point. It means earth used to be infinity. Now you become finite. It’s finite because of all the people. It means human activity is starting to damage the ecosystem and that was not happening 200 years ago.
But now it’s happening. But people are now waking up. People didn’t realise that we are going through the transition almost like water become ice. There is a fresh transition taking place on earth. So if you look at the development of China, India, or Taiwan, Thailand. All follow the pattern of western development but that was the time that earth was infinity. Now earth is finite. So we really have to change. Change the use of the energy. Fossil energy is going to dry out and we have to depend on the solar energy or nuclear. And that we really have to make our mind to do a lot of research.
So I do see in the next 20 years because the petroleum will peak, demand will go up. There will be a gap between the demand and supply. And there will be an energy crisis on the one hand. On the other hand earth has become finite so we have to worry about how our earth consume the pollutions. So those two conditions will make it extremely difficult for human society. The only way out I can see is to learn to use energy efficiently. For example lighting in the room. We can use about 25 percent of the electricity to get the same light by using light emitting diode. You can use the combined hybrid automobile even at the present time will save you energy more than factor two.
We do have enough technology to save energy. To use energy more efficiently. So that will go a long way. On the one hand, we have to learn to use the solar energy more efficiently but for the next 50 years saving energy, making energy more efficient, will be a very important way. As a scientist, I do believe that in spite of the fact that science and technology will help humanities but we have to learn to walk together as one community. Globalisation has gone halfway. So you do see economies is globalised but nation based competition still fiercely going /- – -/ so you see war, friction. Before the end of the century if we do not learn to operate as one community for the entire world I think the chances of humanity to survive on earth will be very, very small.";392;Environment
Do the politicians listen to you when you tell them this message?;Yuan T. Lee: They certainly listen and they seem to understand. But they look at the short-term effect. So nobody dare to change. I saw the President of Academy of Sciences of China, former academy of science president Dr Cho. I know him for 25 years now so when we met a couple of weeks ago I said we have been talking about China should develop a different way. Not following the pattern of western style. And keep on using the automobile and you should have the public transportation. But then he said ‘Yes we know but everybody believe that unless the automobile industry becomes successful it will not bring up the entire economy.’ So the automobile industry in Japan, Germany, you know you name it, China. It is producing millions and millions of automobile now. The question is where are you going to get the petroleum in the next 20 years.;392;Advice for young scientists
When you talk to your young students and ask them to look into the future for the future kind of research that is necessary, what fields would you suggest? Where will the big breakthroughs come in the next 20 years?;"Yuan T. Lee: For quite a long time we have been interested in the origin of life. Creation of the universe. Structure of matters and the forces operating in the universe. Last century because we understand the motion of microscopic particles atomic physics developed and that influenced the chemistry. So my field of study doing molecular sketching certainly is based on the advancement made earlier in the 20th century. But now you look at the biology because of the advancement of chemistry, the advancement with the tools, it is now possible to understand many phenomena related to life. So I do believe that in the 21st century life sciences will be bring lots of excitement. 
So if I were to start again probably I will pay more attention to biological sciences even as a chemist. But it was interesting when I started out as a chemist many of my friends told me ‘Yuan, if you want to be a chemist you have to learn physics better otherwise you will not become a good chemist.’ So I studied lots of physics. And I entered areas called chemical physics. It’s an inter discipline area. That certainly helped me develop other things. Now if the young people ask me I will see biology certainly given you excitement but you have to study chemistry better or physics better, otherwise you will not be able to go too far.";392;Advice for young scientists
Just one last question I believe that you’re a good sportsman as well. Do you get time for sport still?;Yuan T. Lee: Yes. Unless you do some exercise you will be melted away. I’m a tennis player. I play tennis. So probably you know this week is Wimbledon. It is going on. Last night I saw Davenport was playing with Cluster. Salapovo was playing with somebody else.;392;Creativity
Today we have had a session, a round table session on the creative environment and creativity in science. There were many views expressed there on how to best accomplish a creative environment. Would you like to comment, and how would you like to …, what is your, the elements of a creative environment?;"John Polanyi: Gosh. I mean that was a very free ranging discussion today which covered all the things that we tend to chat about in the evening as scientists when we’re exhausted. And I wouldn’t dare to try to summarise the elements in it. I think probably the most stressed thing at the round table, and rightly so, was the need to have freedom in order that you can be opportunistic. Because you cannot make plans in science and then doggedly follow them. If you do that’s really a prescription for disaster.
Actually I once sat on a committee which was required to examine the progress of a group of scientists who formed the team, and we were supposed to see that they had followed the plan that they presented in order to get the money to do the research. And I said well, all right, I’ll do it, but only with one stipulation, that if they follow their plan, then we’ll not give them any more funds because clearly, they didn’t discover anything. And so, people were rather shocked. But this had a really rather serious aspect to it as far as I was concerned. I think that the freedom of scientists to pursue discoveries where nature gives an opportunity for learning something, that freedom is being more and more restricted.
And it’s understandable that in well-functioning democracies people want to see accountability. But then they go and introduce a form of accountancy which is inappropriate and damaging and they say, well the sort of thing I just said in that story. They say tell us what you’re going to discover, tell us what those discoveries will, how they will benefit mankind, how they will create prosperity. And this involves scientists in either saying well, that’s inappropriate which is dangerous because you don’t get the funds. And so we start telling these stories and they’re not really true stories, they’re sophisticated sort of science fiction. And when you start to lie about the way in which science is done and the justification for doing it, eventually these things come back to haunt you and people say well, where is the application that you said would come, and in fact it will come. If you put intellectual power into people’s minds that can be used for good and for ill, it’s partly our job to see that it’s used for good. But it can certainly be used.
The irony of course is that as a scientist one has to face two different groups of people, one of whom are very concerned that you are taking public money, you’re disappearing into your laboratory and then you are amusing yourself by learning something about nature perhaps. And then there’s another group of people who see you taking public money, disappearing into your laboratory and they say each time you go into the laboratory you come out with something terrible. And you produce opportunities which we don’t know how to handle, you’re making the world a very dangerous place. Well, you can’t have it both ways, that we are spending our time futilely indulging our curiosity and at the same time we are revolutionising practice to a degree that nobody can handle it.
So which is true? I would say the second is true. So long as you are willing, this was a term used around the round table this morning, as long as you are willing to trust the scientists, and you don’t have to trust them very far, you have to trust them for three years, four years, five years, and then you have to say what did you do? And that’s legitimate. And you have to be tough about it.
But judge them on the basis of their ability to add to the store of human knowledge in a way that’s going to make a difference to people’s thinking. If you do that, you’ll get new ideas and you’ll get them in a cost-effective way. And the problem really lies not with good scientists frittering their time away and wasting people’s money, it comes later with the fact that indeed the discoveries will be made but then we have to somehow decide how to use them. We, not just we scientists, but we human beings.";393;Environment
Let’s turn for a while to university education. I find, at least in my country, that it’s still very sort of conservative in the sense that there is chemistry, there is physics and there’s biology, and to me it seems that the borderlines between the subjects are so fussy today that we might perhaps need to reconsider some of our education systems. Have you had any thoughts about that?;John Polanyi: I’m not sure I caught your thought and I’m not sure I’m going to respond in an interesting way to it. You’re talking about the division between subject areas?;393;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Would we as scientists have been too complacent about the changes that we have seen, about the requirements from governments that we should be more applied?;John Polanyi: I think that’s a very good question. I think the scientists are much too complacent and there are a whole lot of reasons for that. I mean one being that scientists want to be left alone to do science and if you start fighting battles of science policy you of course take large amounts of your time away from research. But there’s another reason and that is that biting the hand that feeds you is not encouraged, and it may be punished. And so people are loath to do that, not just for themselves, for their colleagues. You know, if I say this scheme which is actually helping your research and helping mine, but it’s a badly funded scheme because it just doesn’t take account of the fact that university research should be free. Anyway, so I argue against it and they cancel it, well not just I suffer but you suffer too. So a lot of people have a vested interest in scientists not complaining too loudly and they are not complaining sufficiently.;393;Role of Science
You mentioned your involvement in the Pugwash movement. How much of your time did you spend on these issues?;"John Polanyi: That’s very difficult to say but certainly not enough of my time. But I was involved in getting Pugwash moving in Canada but this was in the late 1950s and in that forum and in other forums I have been part of a sub group of the scientific community which has tried to, in the first place, tried to damp down the arms race by saying there are ways in which we could have arms control. Politicians tend to say it’s not been done, people will cheat, we’re safer just building a bigger weapon or a better weapon than our opponent. And so, I think that scientists have a role in saying the world can change, we should not rely always on winning the arms race with every other country because that way lies disaster. And scientists have been saying this but not a large enough group of scientists. That’s what Pugwash existed for.
So there were a succession of arms control issues in which scientists were providing technical advice, but they were doing much more than that. They were saying this is a rotten direction to go in, it’s dangerous, we should be going in that direction. It happened, in my country it happened with the question of should Canada get nuclear weapons, the United States actually wanted us to get them because we could help defend the US, this was late 1950s. Next question: should Canada build nuclear fallout shelters? I and other scientists said look, this is ridiculous, they aren’t going to work. But really what we were saying was we don’t want to live in a world in which we dig holes and all disappear in them. There must be a more happy, dignified outcome to the forward march of technology than that we all become underground creatures.
And so it went on. And most recently it has been the question of sophisticated missile defences. And it’s certainly true that under favourable conditions you can hit a bullet with a bullet and that you can hope to defend yourself poorly in that way. But under real circumstances where somebody does something surprising, there is a conflict, those circumstances you will never succeed in hitting a bullet with a bullet and it’s really part of every scientist’s experience that it is easier to make something malfunction, in this case we’re talking about a sophisticated defence system, than make it function. It is easier therefore for me to go into the lab where my student is and mess up his experiment than it is for him to make it work. And that being the case this anti-missile defence screen which has now been re-born as the US National Missile Defence which shortly will become the US and Canadian Missile Defence unless we argue against it, and thereafter will become the US Canada and Europe Missile Defence, and it won’t work. And what it will do is spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a direction which really offers no hope.
The direction that offers hope is to build up democracies, that requires spending money, give people in those countries the opportunity to reach levels of wealth which are satisfying so that they have countries which are open and to a degree contented. And at the same time establish an international rule of law which we’re trying to do, a new world is being born in which when the nationals of a certain country are victimised, other countries say this is intolerable, we’ve got to do something. That doesn’t mean they actually do something, but they say it and they mean it. Increasingly they will do something if we clamour for it. And I think that scientists, having gone so far along the path of saying what sort of world they think is a decent and civilised one, could help further that process and that’s what scientists in Pugwash and other similar groupings are trying to do.";393;Creativity
Thank you for coming to this interview, professor. I just wanted to ask you first of all, I believe this year, which is the year 2005, it’s the year of Einstein and people are trying to commemorate and trying to make the general public understand more about science. Do you think that it’s important that we highlight our genius, the geniuses that we have, who have been with us and those we have around us still?;Jerome Karle: Yes, I believe that it’s an excellent idea. Einstein was very special. He saw and understood things that really revolutionised the understanding of what the scientific world was all about 100 years ago. He changed things. It took something of the order of 40 years of various people, good scientists, trying to find out whether he was right or not, and trying to find out what they could do with it. And they finally ended up with some very important practical applications. Now the thing about Einstein was that he did things like that all his life. And when scientific developments come into a person’s head which are then passed on to others to think about, to work on, to develop, and if that comes or occurs time after time, then you have an example of true genius.;395;Future Research
Is it important for the scientific world to be able to have people that one could relate to the general public, to make us understand how important science is for the development?;Jerome Karle: I think that that’s very important because, in effect, the public generally, through their governments, need to support. I think that life would be very difficult for scientists if they irritated the public. No, but I think that the public understands. For example, with respect to medical questions, they don’t relate generally to esoteric science, but they can certainly understand when there are new developments and understandings that will be able to make life safer and better for them.;395;Roles of Science
In your personal life, in which way did it change after you received the Nobel Prize?;Jerome Karle: I don’t readily change very much. There was a fun part. For example, since my institution is a governmental institution, the President of the United States called me up and we had a nice chat for a while. The fun part was not only the telephone call but he invited me and my wife to come to some of the big dinners that were held at the White House and that sort of thing. So it was an opportunity to see things that generally speaking you’d never see.;395;Impact of the Nobel on you
That must have been great. I believe that you have worked with your wife for many years and she’s been very much part of your research and studies. Can you tell us a bit about the partnership that you two have?;Jerome Karle: What we did was that we continued a research problem that we had worked on when we were getting our PHD degrees. And we worked very closely on that. She is extremely bright and has all kinds of honours – in fact probably if one went down the list and so forth, she would have more honorary degrees and prizes and so forth – but she didn’t receive the Nobel Prize, which astonished me, because we co-worked on that together.;395;Career Devleopment
Do you think she should have had it as well, together with you?;Jerome Karle: Absolutely. And in fact one of the professors in Sweden who was responsible for the Nobel Prize was very outspoken about it and he did something which is never done and that is, after you receive the Nobel Prize you’re expected to visit universities in Norway and Sweden and give lectures. And he fixed it up so that she would accompany me and give her own lectures.;395;Mentors (Role models)
In general, afterwards, when you thought about that work, do you think you as a scientist have a responsibility for what you are creating, so to speak, if you look at the long term, the way the politicians and so on use the creations?;Jerome Karle: Yes. I have a story about that. I worked at the University of Chicago. They had a special set up there. There were – oh, I don’t know – six or eight major places around the United States working on this problem. And I can tell you that at one time, after it seemed as if we were succeeding in making what we needed to make, we wrote a letter to the President and asked him to please not be the first one to use it. And we thought that was settled. But, as you know, that didn’t happen. And that was always a source of discomfort to me.;395;Role of Science
Do you think today that too much research …? I mean you’re still working and I know that a lot of scientific research is being brought in to the military machine, not just in the United States, all over the world. Is it OK that so much money still is being spent on military research? Whether one could maybe do it more on other issues – or do they go hand in hand? Does it have to be like this?;Jerome Karle: I can only speak for myself. For myself, I certainly wish that it would have stopped a long time ago. But there’s another issue that’s close to it and that is the issue of trying to get everybody to agree to stop. I don’t know how to feel about it. Certainly let’s not build it up any more. But I’m not so sure about destroying it at this point.;395;Diversity-Women in Science
Can you tell us about your first years there?;"Aaron Klug: Well, I came to Cambridge as a graduate student from South Africa.
Aaron Klug: In 1949. And I thought originally I would do a Part II, which is the last year of the undergraduate, but my tutor, supervisor it was called, said I knew enough and I might as well start research, which I did. I should explain there was a fair amount of freedom which was rather important. And actually I had to find a supervisor. And indeed it wasn’t a very good choice of supervisor in some sense because my PhD was on a problem in solid state physics – my PhD is in physics – which didn’t lead anywhere directly, but it gave me the chance of learning a great deal of things which later turned out to be very useful, although I didn’t know it. In fact it was a preparation for things to come, without my knowing it; it wasn’t planned in any way.";398;Life
When you came to London?;"Aaron Klug: Yes, and that determined really my scientific career, because up to then I hadn’t had a firm idea of what I wanted to do. I wanted to work on the structure of matter by logic or inorganic. In fact I wanted to work with the problems in solid state physics, which I found quite fascinating. I’m interested in how things are made and constructed.
But I did know some biology because I’d been a medical student in South Africa before – well pre-medical – so I’d done physiology, biochemistry, things of that sort. So I wasn’t totally green when I came to work on viruses. And I wasn’t scared. Because most physicists can’t bear to touch wet, messy things, you see, but I didn’t mind mincing up a plant when I worked on plant viruses and doing a bit of chemistry and things like that. So in a sense it was quite a long preparation, but it turned out to be very good in the end – but totally unplanned.";398;Life
I see. So you moved to London and then worked together with Rosalind Franklin?;"Aaron Klug: Yes I did. She died while I was there. I met her in 1954 and she died in 1958. But during a few short years together with two or her researchers we worked out the general structure of tobacco mosaic virus and after she died I went on with the three dimensional structure – because it’s not an ordinary crystal; you have to develop new analytical methods for dealing with it. And I can do some mathematics. But I have always kept close to experimental work.";398;Mentors (Role models)
We’ll come back to viruses, but I know that you have written an article on Rosalind Franklin and she is quite known for her role, or the denial of her role, in the discovery of the double helix of DNA. Can you say some words about that? And Wilkins …?;"Aaron Klug: She did the basic experimental work which supplied Watson and Crick with key information, some known to her and others unknown to her. And she was a very single minded person, but she had no collaborator. She didn’t get on well with Wilkins.
Aaron Klug: Wilkins was the man who got the Nobel Prize with Watson and Crick. He had started the work on DNA, so in that sense he was justified, but later he gave up the problem and began to work on complexes of DNA in sperm, you see, because nobody knew at that time that the DNA would carry the secret of its action with structure which was very unusual then in science. But she, being a very systematic and very good physical chemist, which is what she was, she was able to sort out two different forms of DNA.
Up to then everybody had been working on mixtures and that had made it possible to get very good x-ray diffraction photographs of the two forms. And she developed methods – improved the x-ray method, again as another crystal in the ordinary sense. So if she had continued to live and if Watson and Crick hadn’t intervened she would have got the structure out but it would have come out in a less dramatic way. It would have come out in stages. I have no question about it and that’s what I’ve written about it in two articles – one in ’68 and one in ’74. But I did learn from her. I think the main thing I learnt was to be single minded.   I tended to do different things because I was interested in a curious amount then rather than being dedicated to a particular target.";398;Meaning(Values) of Work
Why was it so interesting to get this structure?;"Aaron Klug: It was there. Also, it became a test object, in the sense that some of the methods of working out large assemblies, which is what we pioneered – because you must remember that at the time, when I started on it, nobody had even solved the structure of a single protein; Perutz and Kendrew only did that in … 1962 they got the Nobel Prize. It came out in 1958 whereas I started working on viruses in 1954. And it was a time when people didn’t believe that Perutz and Kendrew could solve the structure of a protein, let alone a virus. We took risks in some sense, although I didn’t think of it at the time.";398;Creativity
During your career, what do you consider is the most significant discovery in molecular biology?;"Aaron Klug: I think the structure of chromatin which is a material of which chromosomes were made. And I began that after work on transfer RNA, which also are quite a major achievement. That was also done by Alex Rich. We competed with him. But the chromatin – and I would think another major achievement has been work I’ve done since my Nobel Prize when I discovered a new class of proteins which are involved in switching genes on and off. They’re called zinc fingers and they work in a modular fashion. Each of the fingers, which includes zinc, recognises three base pairs of DNA so it’s a modular system, a combinatorial system and after we began to understand how it worked and the fingers are flexibly connected so they can attach themselves and recognise the sequence of DNA.
And we’ve now used this to engineer artificial transcription factors which can switch genes on and off and there are now a couple of companies in the world developing it. I think that’s quite a major achievement and I’m still working on it. I’m trying to improve the specificity, because you have to be sure when you target DNA that you have to hit the right target and not hit something closely similar. In a human genome of 3,000,000,000 bases, if you have a run of DNA, a certain sequence, you might well have something very similar elsewhere and you want to be sure you get the right one. So you spend a lot of time trying to develop specific recognition.";398;Creativity
My last question then – where are you going to jump over to now?;Aaron Klug: Well I’m not going to live forever. Some years ago I started a group on Alzheimer’s disease. I started out in a managerial capacity but I got involved in the science and I cover quite a wide range in these methods and so we showed that there was a molecule called tau which aggregated in an abnormal form and killed the cells and that wasn’t known before. And so that has been quite useful. And I still keep a foot in that, together with my colleagues. I don’t work in it myself but I’ve done a few useful things there. I can’t say, but mostly I’m thinking about gene regulation, how to regulate gene expression, which is an immediate problem in molecular biology. Because if you can intervene in gene expression you can actually follow a biological pathway and develop a central pathway, or in the case of a disease. We have used zinc fingers to reduce the herpes simplex virus by a factor of ten, using zinc fingers to attack the gene of the virus. That’s done not so much to cure the disease but to be able to see what you can do. This is what I’m doing now. That’s my main interest.;398;Creativity
What is science and what is science in relation to other ways for humans to deal with the wonders of life, like literature and poetry or music or arts or religion?;"Roald Hoffman: First I think science is a social system of western European invention, not an American one, for gaining reliable knowledge. I would say not truth, and we can talk about why there is a difference. And it has several components to it. It has curious people, some of whom are interested in mathematics or good at it. It has people who are willing to get their hands dirty, experimenters, not just philosophers. It has a system for communicating that knowledge and in fact a compulsion if not an addiction for doing so, exchanging that knowledge. And it is a system which makes use of pretty normal people to get interesting things to learn about the world around us and for us.
It has another aspect and which sometimes has been lost, it was over romanticised in the 19th century and that is that it should improve the human condition in some way. And that is implicit in Nobel’s will, it is interesting that it is there because it is a 19th century document. I would say like Peter Medawar does that at least we should ameliorate the human condition, to make it a little bit better. It is a little bit lost when science has become so professional as it is but I think it is important to revive it.";400;Role of Science
Are there any similarities between the scientific way of searching for answers and for example religious or for artistic?;Roald Hoffman: Well, let’s talk about religion and science a little bit. I think religion and science come out initially from some of the same roots and that is a desire to understand the world. The mysteries of the world. The lightning, the lights, the stars, the fine patterns in it. Now they start out also for many religions with a feeling that the world is real. Some religions have added on that the real world does not matter and what matters is the afterlife. But a lot of religion begins with the idea that the world is real and that the actions of human beings matter, whether you are good in some way. I think that is actually a fairly common starting point. After that I think that there are differences on deciding who is in charge of the order, let’s say. But I think they start off from some similar things. What was the rest of the question?;400;Creativity
Are there some dogmas in science that you just not mention?;"Roald Hoffman: One can look for dogmas in science and I think they are there. At the same time the edible complex is very strong in science of young people making careers by slaying their fathers, by drawing out ideas and that is an accepted way of doing so. A much less respect for authority in the end. But there are dogmas. So why are there dogmas? Because there are human beings at work.
But somehow the social system of science that there are many people doing things assures that in the long run those dogmas do not stay dogmas. Whereas the social system of religion perpetuates the authority often. And makes it more difficult to introduce change. Interesting balance between change and stasis in science. You do invoke authority that is in part what those footnotes are about in papers, but at the same time you want to do something new. An interesting system.";400;Creativity
Do you think there is such a relation between truth, beauty and simplicity?;"Roald Hoffman: No. I think this is a falling into the weakness of the human mind to think that the world is simple. And it is an interesting tripartite relationship. I guess I’m fighting in part what I would say is, pernicious ideas of physicists coming into chemistry who think the moment you can write up Sherman’s equation that all of chemistry is solved. And behind that are statements by the Iraq great physicist, theoretical physicist about this equation that an equation, if it is beautiful, must be true.
Yes, some are in the old world but not in this world that we have. The equations are simple in part and yet complex. Symmetry is there, symmetry gets broken. Things happen in a body especially when they are subject to evolution things in incredibly complicated ways. The way a message is sent from one nerve to another with an intermediate of a molecule, dopamine on serotonin and there is one thing that sets it loose and another one that detects it, but it is not done in one way. After a while this thing looks like what we would call in the United States, a Rube Goldberg machine, one of those cartoons where there is something that does something else that does something else and terribly complicated.
So those things are I think those are natural, that things are complicated. I think it is the dreams of the simplicity of our mind which cannot sometimes be over complexity and that’s true of personal relationships as well as it is with politics or with science. What is interesting to me is that scientists should fall for simplicity. Given that they are faced with the realities of complexity all the time. And they will come back and tell you, physicists, well if you take it apart underneath there are some simple equations. Yes, but the taking apart has destroyed the essence and the reality of anything that is real, and they never put it together. They only take the watch apart like children.";400;Creativity
You mentioned this is also a voice of a poet, maybe we can listen to one of your poems?;Roald Hoffman: Sure. Let me read a poem but let me preface it by some comments about it. In it you will see many voices of different ways of trying to understand the world around something simple which is something happening in Provence in France, […]. And the poem is called ‘Enough Already’ and behind it, initially it was called ‘Dayenu’ which is what one a prayer, a song in the Passover say there, which means that would have been enough if God had only taken us out of Israel that would have been enough, but he had done other things. And there is a little bit of that. And there is in this also … so there is something about my Jewish background in this, in the phraseology here. Let me read it anyway.;400;Creativity
Do you find science is an inspiration for your writing? In science and in poetry?;"Roald Hoffman: Yes, it is. It is limited because some of the sort of poetry and sciences depend on them being part of the cognitive framework. Knowing what went before, what it is about. But part of it is what I find inspiring is the language, the kind of natural language that scientists speak, and they don’t the language is important. They think equations and chemical formulas are important. But language is all we’ve got, and this language is made to serve and express things so words like energy and force mean special things well defined and we try to make them fit. And then there are words invented and words used, let me give you an example.
What often happens to me is it is given to me to go to dull seminars and sometimes after I fall asleep I wake up and it is still going on and so I listen sometimes to the words even if they are not so interesting. And someone came at a seminar and was talking about some mathematical equation, he said “Let us assume free boundary conditions”. He was talking about some technical words, boundary conditions are what you do on a mathematical equation to make it fit at the ends but sort of the idea, free boundaries was very interesting because it was a typical Zen idea of something being free and something being constrained. So I worked that into a poem. So the language is interesting. Then there is a lot of metaphor, let me give you an example.
Roald Hoffman: Yes, in science which I can use in poetry. Someone was talking about once at another seminar about the metamict state. It is a funny word, metamict. It is not used very much. Someone had invented it, so what was it? It was a state of matter of, for instance, radioactive minerals. Minerals in which there was a radioactive atom like thorium. The minerals when formed gave beautiful transparent crystals, perfect crystals, but after a while the atoms which were sitting at the sites in the crystal began decomposing in nuclear reactions. And as they emitted some ray they rebounded and the ions that were left behind bounced into other atoms and created this order in the lattice and with time the crystal grew whitish yellow and amorphous dull looking and was destroyed. And that was the metamict state. It’s a poem by itself, I mean the ending is within that. And all that order has been destroyed without any plan to do so. So I took that and wrote a poem about that. So there are metaphors like that.";400;Creativity
How do your colleagues or the scientific community react to that?;"Roald Hoffman: Well, I think or how do they react to the poetry in general to the excursions out of science. On one hand they react positively, and they are glad someone is doing it. They have a lot of respect for spiritual things. It shows up in interesting ways not necessarily directly, but it shows up in little things like when somebody writes a book that they use a poem as an epigraph or something like that. I think some of them think that he can afford to do it and we can’t and to some extent they are right.
The young assistant professor up for promotion, should he or she put up front their activity outside the science. I think they should put in something about their teaching and their attempts to communicate to the public. But very often they are afraid to do so and they make some judgement and it is correct that it is not the prime thing they are evalued on but it certainly adds little on the edges and adds some colour, could make a difference in a decision. Some people are just, some of my colleagues might think that this is something one does when one no longer does science, goes into administration, does history, sociology of science. Well, so to them I have to prove to them that I still do science. I have just finished writing two proposals. Maybe I feel I have to prove but I enjoy doing it also.
You know what hurts the most is when it comes through that somehow people think that this activity of writing poetry or running this café or something, when they think this is easy. That hurts. Because on a poem I go through typically 15, 20 drafts, I don’t do that on a scientific paper. No, it is true. I have written 500 scientific papers, so it becomes easier but still it was always easier to do the science and I am actually trying something harder. And they just have to try it, I would say. So I get angry at that if that happens. But by and large there is a lot of respect in the community for this.";400;Environment
The poetry writing, does this make you a better scientist do you think?;"Roald Hoffman: I think the poetry writing of course makes me feel better about myself for having tried to do that. I think that is true about anyone, that they need some other thing to do. I think the poetry writing has given me a bit of an appreciation and more for the power of concise statement but then I have that in science too. Once again comes back maybe simplicity, but it is not quite simplicity because it is a complex statement of word but it says something economically. Something intensely. And I have learned a little how to do that through the poetry.
I think much more than either the science helping me to do the poetry or the poetry helping the science. I think I am working out something that is in me that wants to see the relationships, to watch to see relationships, to communicate that to people. And I am doing that in the science and I am doing that in the poetry in other ways. And occasionally because I don’t believe in separating my worlds I will separate them. I’ll not write that article or the poetry because I am not going to get it published because I have got to get by the gate keepers. But occasionally and the kind of thing I have done here in Stockholm, this visit, someone gives me a chance to talk about both worlds and not to separate them and I love it.";400;Creativity
So my final question would be how do you find time to do all of this?;"Roald Hoffman: Oh, that is not a good question because it is, I’ll answer it honestly but there is no time to do all this. First of all, I should probably give up the science and do the writing, so why should I? If I had some rational reasoning behind it but I’m not rational. The rational reasoning is that there is simply lots of good people doing the science, there are fewer people and therefore I think it is of more value to society to be able to work on this area in-between, of popularising science, of building bridges between the scientists and especially the shapers of the spirit and the arts and humanities. There are less people doing that. But I still find the science fun, first of all.
But now how do I do all this? So I haven’t given up the science and the teaching. I am 67 and I could retire but I don’t want to, I don’t have to, so I am still doing the science. As I said I have just written two major research proposals to the National Science Foundation for two different aspects of my work, each with three years of research. I have ideas that I want to work them out. So I have added on the writing to the science and I would say that if I were to analyse my days are very complex and interesting. But if I were to analyse it more than half the time I spend probably on writing or societal activities somehow related to it more than on the science. I’ve added it on and it has not been done without personal problems in my life. It is not easy to live with someone like me who does all these things because I need to be in control of my time, I need to be able to, if I want to, to sit down and write and there have been stresses in my personal life as a result. So, it has not been without some difficulties.";400;Free time
Are you happy with the way that genetic engineering has developed since then?;Paul Berg: Well, like most scientific advances, they open the door to new kinds of researches and I don’t carry the title of father of genetic engineering very well, because in fact we made only the first step and everybody else seized immediately on this new technology, new capability and began to use it for their own purposes, which is what it was intended to do. But there are many, many very smart people in this world and they all figured out new ways to be able to use recombinant DNA so that today recombinant DNA is the most important tool and governs almost every question that anybody could ask in biology and even outside biology, which is really interesting because it has affected virtually every way in which people want to investigate living organisms – plants or insects or whatever. Recombinant DNA is the basic tool and so one has to feel very good about the impact of one’s early work, even though we didn’t foresee everything that would happen.;401;Role of Science
You could only imagine the impact?;Paul Berg: No, many people have asked me did you foresee all the new kinds of things that would develop in the whole industry and the answer is very clearly no. We had in mind to do the experiment that we set out to do and, in the early stages, we increased or widened the range of what we did but it was like an avalanche behind us. Many, many people were developing new approaches and particularly industry.;401;Dealing with difficulties
So what is your opinion about the commercial pressure on research?;"Paul Berg: I think it’s, well it’s positive in the sense that it brings money to the academic institutions; it provides jobs for the people who are trained in our laboratories, but the universities have themselves become commercialised and I think my university, Stanford University, is probably one of the leaders in large part because it made a lot of money very early from the patents on recombinant DNA. I mean, Stanford probably over 17 years of the patent acquired something like, probably more than $100 million, so other universities see that as a possibility of a way of earning money so they become much more aggressive about seeking patents so now, whereas before when I was growing up in the university, nobody ever asked me to patent anything and I never patented anything in my life. I gave away everything we did.
I gave away everything we ever did because what we did it for was to benefit research, but in fact today universities come into the labs and try to teach people how to look for things to patent, help them to start companies, so we now have a very different kind of mix and I think the openness with which scientists usually talk about their research is compromised to some extent, but it has changed the whole climate about the thing. People think in terms of what they’re doing, will I be able to start a business? Will I be able to patent it? Instead of thinking, getting it published and being excited by the fact that people want to use it.";401;Role of Science
Can you tell us some words about the Asilomar conferences?;Paul Berg: Yes. Well, the concerns about the recombinant DNA or genetic engineering came from the scientists, so that was a very crucial fact which I think historically people now identify as a very major and important stage in the development of science, and that is scientists who developed the new technology themselves began to worry about whether there were any dangers and therefore took a major step to make a public announcement saying that this research is very, very important, very powerful but it also has certain risks and we need to examine these risks and determine whether the research should go forward or whether we have to develop new ways to do the research and protect the public and I think we gained an enormous amount of public admiration, if you will, and tolerance and so we were allowed to actually begin to deal with the question of how can we prevent any dangers, things coming out of our work? And so this led to the Asilomar conference. The Asilomar conference was called to bring scientists who wanted to work using recombinant DNA …;401;Creativity
Do you think it should be time now for Asilomar 3?;Paul Berg: Well, we had an Asilomar 3 and it was to discuss whether an Asilomar model, whether that way of approaching problems could be applied to today’s problems and different people had different views.;401;Future research
Do you think that some parts of research or of science should be forbidden?;"Paul Berg: I think when there is clear evidence of inflicting damage or danger, then I think there’s a strong argument that things should be forbidden but I think they should only be forbidden for specific time intervals, so for example if there’s a moratorium on a particular line of research, or even if you pass legislation to forbid certain kinds of research, it should only last, say, five years and in five years to re-examine the issue again. Maybe the agreement is it is still something that shouldn’t be done and so you go forward this way; but in many cases in our country, if the government passes a Bill and makes it law, sometimes it’s exceedingly difficult to change it and so you’re locked into a situation which, five years later, doesn’t look the right decision. Just if you have a minute, I just want to mention one interesting anecdote.
This year, the Alaska Foundation, which was a major award giving foundation in the US, gave the award to a man named Robert Edwards. Robert Edwards was the man who invented in vitro fertilisation. 25 years ago, when he was doing the preliminary experiments, I can tell you that the huge protests were the same as they are today for stem cells. People thought he was going to make monsters, that the was going to produce children who were going to be deformed and very incapacitated. So today we have a million, more than a million live births, many people who have had children they could not have had before, so 25 years later we recognise that this was a major health and medical benefit and we give him a big prize. Alaska Award often comes just before the Nobel Prize, and yet if you think back at that time, if we would’ve passed the law which says IVF is forbidden, against the law, we would’ve shut down a whole very important advancement and I think we can point to recombinant DNA as another.
Recombinant DNA came very close in our country and I know in Sweden also, to being forbidden. We would’ve lost the entire bio-technology revolution, so we have to think very clearly before you pass laws that forbid scientific work and so the question you asked is are there some lines of science that should be forbidden? Temporarily perhaps, but certainly not forever.";401;Creativity
Can you share your secret with us (on winning the Nobel Prize twice)?;"Frederick Sanger: Well, I don’t think there are any secrets. First thing, you know, people ask me this sometimes and I tell them the first thing is to get a prize. And that’s much more difficult to get the first prize than to get the second one. Because if you’ve already got a prize then you can get facilities for work and you can get collaborators and everything is much easier. And I think I was lucky in that respect that I got my first prize when I was rather young, about 40, and most people when they get a prize they get a good job, they become professors or directors of a large group. And I didn’t because I wouldn’t be any good at that.
So really you’ve got to be bad at something, but I was quite good at doing research and I could go on doing research for another 20 years and I didn’t have to apply for grants and that sort of thing. Nowadays there’s a lot of people that when they’re doing science they have to apply for grants, spend a lot of time doing paperwork which I never had to do after I had won the first prize. So I had 20 years when I could just do what I wanted. And I started on a rather difficult project and spent all my time at it and I was very lucky at that time, succeeded in certain parts of the work.";403;Impact of Nobel prize on you
But you switched your fields after the first prize?;Frederick Sanger: It wasn’t such a serious switch. My first work was on proteins, you know, things we’re actually made of. And the problem was to do what we call sequencing, actually measure the structure of the proteins, and I worked on proteins. And after that I attacked a much more difficult problem which was the nucleic acids and particularly the DNA. And I eventually came up with a method for sequencing DNA and learning about its structure and that’s what I got the second prize for, together with Wally Gilbert who was also working on the same thing.;403;Creativity
How do you view this development in modern biology?;Frederick Sanger: It’s very exciting I think. I think there’s going to be a lot of use for medicine if we can really understand DNA and you know it is very complicated. There’s 3,000 million letters, as it were, in the DNA and you’ve got to read all that. And of course there are a lot of people working on that now to try and decipher the means and how it works. And I think that’s going to be of use to medicine. But we don’t know exactly what the applications will be. There’s a lot of talk of course in newspapers and wild talk about we’re going to cure all sorts of diseases and things.;403;Research
Do you understand the concerns or fears that people feel when reading about modern biology?;Frederick Sanger: Not really, no. I mean there are certain things of course you’ve got to think about. But as regards to the human genome the only thing that I’ve heard about is that some people may have to pay more for their insurance policies. And I don’t think that’s a very serious thing. I mean that’s a question for society to decide whether or what things should be used for. But surely it’s much more significant that one should consider what might happen, what good things might happen, that people might be more healthy and more happy. That’s what science is about, to try and improve conditions for humanity on this earth. And I think we should think about that ultimately. And against that you can worry a bit about what insurance you’re going to have to pay. And I think that’s for the insurance industry and not a very serious thing is it?;403;Role of Science
What do you think about the commercial success and pressures in molecular biology?;Frederick Sanger: Of course it’s I think essential thing that happens. I mean that is a question for society to decide, isn’t it? I mean that’s the way capitalism works, isn’t it, that people want to make money. And if they’re working on some good, useful work then that should be very agreeable. But it would be nice to know everything that’s going on and there is a lot of work going on now using the human genome work, which is kept secret now until it’s used.;403;Role of Science
What is the place of religion within your scientific philosophy?;"Frederick Sanger: Well, that’s rather difficult to say I think. I was brought up as a Quaker. My father was a Quaker and I think I was never actually a sort of Quaker, I was never a member of the Society of Friends. And when I got to university and stuff and started studying science I gradually lost interest really in religion and Quakerism. But it has influenced I think my philosophy in two ways really. The Quakers are pacifists. They will not take human life. And I still go along with that, and I believe that.
And the Quakers are also very keen on truth and they believe in fundamental truth is one of the virtues. And I was brought up with that philosophy, that I must not tell lies when I was a little boy. And I think this is very important for scientists, because a scientist is really studying truth and you’ve got to be very certain about what you say is truthful. And I think this is a philosophy which is worthwhile because a lot of people I think nowadays are quite happy to say something that’s wrong and it can get them into difficulty and it can get other people into difficulty. I actually have a sort of fixation about it rather, even when somebody asks me, you know they say to me how are you Fred? And I say oh I’m terrible. I should say I’m fine thanks. It’s a standard thing.";403;Creativity
You have developed some other interests such as gardening and ‘messing about in boats’. What do you do when you’re messing about?;Frederick Sanger: Well, I used to do a bit of sailing and messing about really. I had a boat, a sailing boat, and I had a motor boat. Now I have given up sailing, I don’t do any sailing, but I still have a motor boat and I go on the river and mess about, just being on the river and cruising away from the roads is very pleasant. But gardening is what I do mostly and just living it.;403;Life
Are you a successful gardener?;Frederick Sanger: No, I find it’s … no I’m actually much busier, I think, than I was when I was working because I’ve got time to do all sorts of things. I was going to do lots of different things like painting and building. And I used to do a lot of carpentry at one time, used to do a lot of carpentry. I find that there’s too many things to do. And I’ve got rather a large garden and that takes most of my time now.;403;Life
So what is your biggest success in the garden?;Frederick Sanger: Biggest success? I don’t know really. I think just enjoying myself. And it’s nice for my family.;403;Life
Were you of the same opinion in ’64 that the field is finished now and I have to move?;Absolutely not. Absolutely not. The field has grown enormously. The field of structure and bonding, and how atoms are held together to make chemical compounds has received a great deal of work and understanding and extended particularly towards how the molecules react, how they transform to other species, and even in recent years there has been a great transformation of computational chemistry and theoretical chemistry which allows one to predict structures, to guess reactions, almost predict reactions, so I think that will continue to improve.;408;Research
What does it mean for our understanding of nature, that you can understand how material is structured on this level?;The problem is how do molecules react, because if you want to transform a molecule into something useful or something that you’re interested in, it helps a lot to have the structure because you can tell where the reactivity parts are, where you can change the molecule most easily, especially if you know the structure and then if you know how the charges on the atoms change. You can then make predictions about the reactions and do the transformations that previously were only trial and error. Now you can, with a purpose. That means you can explore much more complex systems, much more complex reactions.;408;Creativity
How do you get this kind of self-confidence that you can believe that my interpretation and my idea is right?;"Well, in order to make one of these kind of discoveries, you have to have read a lot, you have to know a lot and you have to suddenly, or maybe not suddenly, but gradually see something that’s different, that is implied or something that’s wrong, as I did in the case of the hydrides, I perceived it was wrong, but you then have to criticise it yourself before you test it or present it and as your confidence grows – it may take a long time, it may take 10 minutes, it may take years to develop your own confidence in these things – and sometimes you are wrong.
What is bad is to publish something that’s not very interesting …
It’s very important, that I learned from Linus Pauling, that it’s not a disgrace in science to publish something that’s wrong. What is bad is to publish something that’s not very interesting and so I learned from him that you really, he said once to me: It’s not what you can look up somewhere that counts, it’s what you really know that counts and if you know that, then that’s the basis for your discovery, and you won’t be shaken out of it if you have developed a certain amount of confidence and if you make some discoveries, then you can go on to make others and that is a criterion that we really believe that people who are creative remain creative. Now sometimes they don’t change areas, sometimes they are refining what they did earlier, but they’re still being creative.";408;Creativity
If we go back in time to the start of your career, what made you enter science in general?;"When I was 11 years old, my mother bought me one of those chemistry sets and I stayed with it. My father was a doctor. I went to the drug store to buy chemicals to enlarge the set, to get other chemicals, and I had some very dangerous ones that you cannot buy now because of the regulations and I did all my experiments at home. When I came to high school two things happened. One is the instructor said: Yes you can take chemistry but you already know enough. All you have to do is show up for the final examination, you don’t have to do anything else.
So I did some research and the second aspect is that when I left the high school, I graduated, I gave my chemistry set to my high school. It more than doubled what they had already, as I had a pretty big set, so I was very interested in chemistry from very early days. And I tried to imagine how the molecules were really behaving in terms of structure and so on.";408;Motivation
What do you think of students, that they’re coming to science now, to the university? What would you advise them to choose?;"Oh, they should choose to study something they’re really interested in and then learn to do it well. That’s exactly what I encourage in one; somebody is working for me and says I want to work on something else, I say you do it. Whether it’s a different field, completely different field, or whether it’s a different development and for a rather small number of my very best students, I have allowed them or encouraged them to find their own research problems and take them with them themselves to their new positions, to get a jump on the tenure situation.
Oh I see, so the motivation is coming from inside.
William Lipscomb: Exactly. I try to have them ask what their motivation is, what they’re really interested in, what they would like to be doing some years from now and encourage them to do it.";408;Advice for young scientists
At the same time, science has become a more and more collective enterprise but what you’re pointing out is that it depends on how creative you are as an individual?;"Yes, that’s right because although you have collective, you have in my area, for example, doing protein structure work which is what I’m doing now to determine the structures of proteins and to try to figure out how enzymes speed up reactions by such large factors, that’s one of the things. Or how enzymes are regulated so they don’t run away with the metabolism on a molecular basis, that’s what I’m trying to do but there, I think, you need to try to imagine what is going on and you also need a fairly large group of people working to do all the things that need to be done.
It reaches its zenith in the case of the particle accelerators, the physicists who need very large amounts, but there’s some group of people who have to, or person who has to lead, who has to set the agenda to say what particles you’re going to work on, what enzymes are you going to study. It’s a very important choice and so I think that the role of individual thought is also present in these large group enterprises that you refer to.
This is the role of the leader.
William Lipscomb: The role of the leader, or the leader could be someone who is not the real leader, not the one who gets the money, but that may be the intellectual leader, maybe one of the students. It can be and it has happened.";408;Creativity
So you can compare the leader of a research group to a conductor in an orchestra?;Oh yes. Yes, that’s an interesting comparison. A lot of people think the orchestra is playing and the conductor doesn’t do very much but the conductor’s the person that gives shape to the music, gets the phrasing, and if he has really fine musicians in solo spots, the question is does he try to help them phrase, or does he let them go? He just decides that on the spot, depending on the musicians, sometimes he’s in control, sometimes he lets them be in control and there are interesting times because there’s a big difference among conductors. Some are very easy to understand and play under and some are very difficult and it’s the same for research groups, I think.;408;Creativity
So why then not start with the sort of traditional question: how did you come into research and what made you chose the field you chose?;"That’s a difficult question because I was grown up in a family of musicians and I learnt to play the piano from my 5th year of age and I always thought I would have to study music. And at 12 I played already concerts, but then there was a war, and I was about between my age of 15 and 18 I couldn’t see a piano, and this is the most important time for a musician because he has to print his /- – -/.
So when the war was over, one day later I got 18 years old, and of course before that I have thought I like as much mathematics, physics, chemistry, and funnily enough I always thought if I am going to study natural sciences it has to be in Göttingen. So I went to Göttingen and it was the first university to open after the war, and they told me I am too young and still would have to go back to school, but I asked them whether I could do it with an examination and so I was accepted and started in 1945 and then it was my teachers who convinced me. I had very good teachers.";422;Motivation
But you also told me that you made a very impressive and short career to get your thesis. Could you please tell the story about your thesis?;"My student time the first semester was physics. I was the student of Heisenberg and of Richard Becker and in experimental physics of Kopfermann and Paul, and in physical chemistry Arnold Eucken, these are all great heroes, and I learnt a lot from them. So I started quite early to do a master thesis in 1947 already, and had to matter the specific heat of heavy water over a large temperature range up to as high as possible – 150, 180 centigrade –  limited by the vapour pressure since that was a big glass vessel in glass which could stand perhaps pressure of 5 or 10 atmospheres, and there was a debate between Arnold Eucken, my teacher, and his assistant. His assistant said “No, it wouldn’t go above 140, 150 centigrade” and Eucken “Oh, you can go at least 200”, because he wanted to have the data. And it was precision management up to 5th decimal because he wanted to test his theory of water and he needed the isotope effect. So I decided in my first experiment to go up to 175 whatever could a poor student do …
And it was at the time when heavy water was very limited and it was very precious.
Manfred Eigen: Oh, it wasn’t even available in Germany then any more. He had still something, 99% purity, and it couldn’t be paid anyway. So I had 450 gram, 450 millilitre of that stuff he gave me, I think his hands were …
Shaking.
… there was a big explosion and the water evaporated and the machine was under the ceiling and it was really a big bang …
Manfred Eigen: … shaking. So it happened at 169 there was a big explosion and the water evaporated and the machine was under the ceiling and it was really a big bang and everybody came to my room and “Oh, poor fellow”, and Eucken came also and said “What did you do with my heavy water”? I said “Yes, but you were the one who told me 200 centigrade”. “But not in the first experiment”, he said.
Well, I wanted to tell him something but he shouted at me and I couldn’t say anything, so I finally went home and next morning came to clean up the room and he came right at first and say “What am I going to do with you now the whole thesis is gone?” I said “Well, I will have built a new calorimeter in 3 or 4 weeks. I know now how it works and “Oh” he said “don’t talk nonsense it’s not the calorimeter, it’s the heavy water”. I said “No wait, don’t start again”, went to the board and said “Here you have your heavy water”. He wouldn’t believe that I did my first experiment with heavy water.
You were clever.  
Manfred Eigen: So then I got quite some freedom in doing my work. So it happened that I finished that work very soon with heavy water and accuracy and not as he suggested to put it on large graph paper – I worked out some /- – -/ functions by which you can approximate it in a suitable way, but then he said “Well, I want to have some data on electrolytes also” I say “Yes, but let me first do my examination”. “Oh” he said, “then we lose time. Why do you need that examine and go on as a doctor please”. “Yes, but what will the faculty say?” He said “That’s my business”, so I finished very early.";422;Personal Characteristics
So then in something like three years you passed your thesis and you were 21 when you had your PhD?;"I finished my thesis was 21 and got my examination was 22 years.
Excellent.
Manfred Eigen: And yes, at 27 I got my first offer for a professorship.
Yes, good.
Manfred Eigen: And so I started very early then having all the students were older than me.
Yes. And then also you have become sort of the father of physical calculations on the evolution of life and origin of …
Manfred Eigen: Oh, that was much later. The Nobel Prize was for fast reactions.
I know that.
Manfred Eigen: So it was in Eucken’s textbook where it said unmeasurably fast reactions and he thought that you mixed two substances it takes a millisecond about because you get tubular and flow and if you do it under pressure you know, so that’s no way. The mixing process takes that much time and if the reaction is faster than you can’t follow it. And I didn’t know how to do it but as a young man you don’t believe what they tell you. I say “There’s nothing which is immeasurably fast” and so I thought of it but couldn’t find a solution. But I learnt by studying electrolytes about the salvation and the interactions and there was a problem in physics which was brought to me that is the high sound absorption of sea water which is, one didn’t have an explanation. I knew it is not the sodium chloride, not the salt in seawater it is …
Well, we soon found out it must be the magnesium sulphur that is the next, because pure water has very little sound absorption and it has two maxima so there must be two processes going on. And there was a suggestion that one was the magnesium and the other the sulphate iron so I said “Well, that’s easy to decide, take magnesium chloride, the chloride iron doesn’t do anything, sodium chloride, and take sodium sulphate and if it’s the sulphate iron the sodium doesn’t do anything”.
And that worked?
Manfred Eigen: No.
It didn’t.
Manfred Eigen: No absorption at all. So my conclusion was it is the interaction and since there were two maxima I thought it must be a coupled reaction. I worked out all the theory like in coupled oscillators with normal modes and so on and it was a quantitative explanation. So at that time I remembered Eucken’s words of “There’s no way to study these fast reactions”. I said “Well, the frequencies we use are one maximum, one  megacycle it’s a millionth of the second, the other is 100 megacycles almost a billionth of a second. I said “Here you see the reaction going on” so the trick is you don’t mix your substances. You start from equilibrium as you do it in a sound wave by the pressure wave and that’s how we started.
… it turned out to be the fastest reaction we know …
And I went to Bonhoeffer – Eucken had died – and proposed to study fast reaction this way and he was enthusiastic about getting me a laboratory and so that was the start of the work for the Nobel Prize and in 1955 we did a very famous experiment, we measured the rate of neutralisation. That means the proton hydroxaline forming water molecule and nobody could measure that before. And it turned out to be the fastest reaction we know. Even faster than an electron with the hydrogen atom or so on. It turns out not only to be controlled by the diffusion of the two partners to each, then when they reach a certain distance where the salvations freeze up they tunnel through it and so it is really the fastest reaction we know. And so you see at the time it was almost Olympic discipline to get the fastest possible reaction.
And then all the inorganic chemists came to us: you can now study the rates of complex formation, then the organic chemists came to measure acid-base catalysis of all types of organic reaction and the bio-chemists came and we did the first studies on allosteric enzymes to measure the control of enzymes, all the elementary steps because this relaxation spectrum is a linearized spectrum gives you like in optics – a spectrum of time content you can resolve mechanisms and then we started to think how can this come about those finely tuned reactions with controlled, and so who did it? When our biologists said of course Darwin explained it but we said but Darwin talked about living beings these are molecules and molecules didn’t know about Darwin as much as Darwin knew about molecules. So that’s when we started to think of evolution and we worked out a theory of molecular evolution which you can formulate in mathematical terms. So we are at your subject now.";422;Creativity
That’s very good. How were you told about the Nobel Prize? Can you remember, of course you do, how the initial message came?;"About my Nobel Prize?
Yes.
… call them damn fast reactions and if you still have fast ones, call them damn fast indeed …
Manfred Eigen: I will tell you. It was 1967, so the essential work on which it was raised was already in -55, -56, -57, in 1960’s turned out that it’s a generally applicable method and we went down to even nanoseconds. Nowadays they go to femtoseconds, as late as … but they were not yet invented at the time. I remember going in -54 to a meeting of Faraday Society where they talked about fast reactions and Hartridge and Roughton talked about this mixing millisecond, he called that very fast because /- – -/ before that said something about a second that’s a fast and then Norrish and George Porter came with the flash photolysis get to the microsecond range and called it extremely fast reactions. I said “My English is not good enough, can anybody tell me how to call … I was going to call these reactions slow reactions … I’m going to …”. “Oh”, they said “No difficulty, call them damn fast reactions and if you still have fast ones, call them damn fast indeed”.
So people told me that there was a Nobel Prize coming up and our cleaning woman the year before had baked cakes because they thought I would get it and there was nothing. So I told them “Relax, that takes many years so there’s no hope”, and then the next year I got it. And I got a phone call from a camera team, that was the first I got: Can we have an interview with you?”, was it 12 o’clock, mid-noon, I said “Yes”. “We’re from Stockholm.” I said “Yes, which day tomorrow?” “No”, they said, “right now”. I said “But you have to come from Stockholm here, as I said we are already at Göttingen”. And then an hour later there was a phone call.
And that was the same day as it was announced?
Manfred Eigen: Yes.
So they knew in advance too?
Manfred Eigen: Somehow they must have, or they have guessed and perhaps they sent several teams to several cities.
Okay.
Manfred Eigen: But anyway, so was it. And then the next weeks I couldn’t do any work because there were always interviews and such things.";422;Impact of the Nobel on you
They sometimes say that the Nobel Prize changes their lives? Did it do that? Do you felt it changed your life?;"No, I was happy to be very sick. I had very serious stomach trouble.
So you didn’t notice a change over here?
Manfred Eigen: Oh yes, I noticed a change and at the Nobel dinner they gave special meals to me and that took place and soon later it happened that I got a bleeding and I had to be taken to an emergency operation and so they took me out for several months and every single … for the interruption were finished, my secretary said no he’s not available he’s sick and so when I came back from the hospital, I could go on with my daily life.
And you didn’t come in to all committees and didn’t have to answer all questions?
Manfred Eigen No, I didn’t, I had good excuses.
So should we then switch to the self-replication of the RNA and the further work on evolution?
Manfred Eigen: Yes, there was much discussion what came first, you know, the egg … if the egg is the DNA and the hen is the protein that means the function or the information. Then of course this was back to our present system it’s the wrong question, they had to come in both, but it seems to be if you ask what is the first prerequisite, is it metabolism or is it self-organisation, it’s coping, it’s selection natural selection, and I would say metabolism can be realised in a very primitive way if you have energy rich substances. They will be used up very soon and then you have to incorporate mechanisms which make the sun energy available but you cannot do without self-reproduction.
You cannot do without selection and self-reproduction is the prerequisite of selection. You get really the competing behaviour by the growth laws and so self-reproduction is necessary by two reasons. It yields a mechanism of selection and it keeps information conserved. Without reproduction you lose the information. Everything has a final lifetime, if you don’t reproduce given the huge number of possibilities, you lose it. And so our first interest was directed towards self-reproducing system like an RNA is the simplest one. DNA is already more complicated and evolution probably came much later than RNA.";422;Impact of the Nobel on you
So when did you do the first RNA experiments?;"Beginning of the 1980’s. But we again did also much theoretical work. In other words, we worked out methods to study the evolution of, and we found that the usual way of constructing trees presupposes that there is a tree, the programme, and we wanted to have a method which decides whether it is a tree or some other kind of diverence. And so we worked out something which is called statistical geometry, Ruthild Winkler-Oswatitsch worked on this and Andreas Dress, he’s a mathematician, and we came out with a new method which we called statistical geometry which tells you what kind of divergences it is and also allows you then to reconstruct nodes in the tree or centres of evolution.
One of the works we studied is all the available sequences of tRNA which we realised must be one of the very early molecules, because it adapts the amino acid to the codon. At that time about 1000 sequences were available so then you could study phylogeny of a given tRNA or you can start the diversions of a family of all the 40 tRNA organisms through all the steps of co-organisms and by combining this we found out that the age of the first divergence, that’s say the divergence between eukaryotes and archaebacteria, was at the time and if you also they could find the first divergence of the families, that means the origin of the code with only 25% longer than that.
So if the first divergence of cell was 3 billion years ago, the code couldn’t be older than 4 billion years and everything now points in the direction that this correct. This was the first time we could get measured without assuming anything. Just numbers from experimental data which taught us. So we went on on the RNA /- – -/ and Peter Schuster is going on now to studying the secondary structure formation and third structures in RNA’s and that’s a wonderful evolutionary problem.";422;Creativity
Do you know several people like you who study evolution sometimes meet religious groups and they have other opinion.;"Oh sure, sure. Every week I get letters. I have no problems with them because I tell them “Look, I’m looking how it was created by the Lord, but you want to tell the Lord how he has to do it”.
Yes okay yes.
Manfred Eigen: And that’s even is contradictory to the first commandment.";422;Personal Characteristics
What’s your view on the discussion we had today whether research in general should be funded by all this that we sell ourselves to companies or contra the old system…?;"That’s entirely wrong. I mean everything which is new has to come out of fundamental research otherwise it’s not new.
Yes.
… if you really want to find something new, it can only come out of fundamental research …
Manfred Eigen: If you know before that you can develop a certain thing then okay you go ahead. It’s important. It’s important for industry that they do purposeful research and so, but if you really want to find something new, it can only come out of fundamental research and it often comes out at much later time it turns out to be.";422;Environment
Do you see any risk in the support from the industry to academy and to universities?;I don’t see a risk if it is done in the proper way if it is too much goal directed and if you only get money from industry and even from government if you can prove that it has a useful purpose, that would be better. It would be the end of fundamental research.;422;Environment
Dr Frederick Sanger, welcome to this Nobel interview. You are one of the very few persons that have been awarded Nobel Prize twice. So I suppose that maybe you know how to do it. Many people would like to get Nobel Prize but they don’t. Can you share your secret with us?;"Well, I don’t think there are any secrets. First thing, you know, people ask me this sometimes and I tell them the first thing is to get a prize. And that’s much more difficult to get the first prize than to get the second one. Because if you’ve already got a prize then you can get facilities for work and you can get collaborators and everything is much easier. And I think I was lucky in that respect that I got my first prize when I was rather young, about 40, and most people when they get a prize they get a good job, they become professors or directors of a large group. And I didn’t because I wouldn’t be any good at that.
So really you’ve got to be bad at something, but I was quite good at doing research and I could go on doing research for another 20 years and I didn’t have to apply for grants and that sort of thing. Nowadays there’s a lot of people that when they’re doing science they have to apply for grants, spend a lot of time doing paperwork which I never had to do after I had won the first prize. So I had 20 years when I could just do what I wanted. And I started on a rather difficult project and spent all my time at it and I was very lucky at that time, succeeded in certain parts of the work.";435;Impact of the Nobel on you
But you switched your fields after the first prize?;"It wasn’t such a serious switch. My first work was on proteins, you know, things we’re actually made of. And the problem was to do what we call sequencing, actually measure the structure of the proteins, and I worked on proteins. And after that I attacked a much more difficult problem which was the nucleic acids and particularly the DNA. And I eventually came up with a method for sequencing DNA and learning about its structure and that’s what I got the second prize for, together with Wally Gilbert who was also working on the same thing.
And Paul Burke got the prize, the same work. But you shared the prize.
Frederick Sanger: Well yes, I got the prize the same year.";435;Creativity
So you were working really on fundamental questions about life and where life comes from.;That’s correct, yes. Rather fundamental questions which were quite mysterious when I started. When I started there were no sequences known at all either in proteins or in nucleic acids. I started about 1940, quite a long time ago. And started working on the proteins and I obtained a sequence of the first protein insulin that was ever done. And that was sequencing. And then after 1958 when I got the first prize I decided to attack the nucleic acids, which was a real challenge. And we did get a method for doing the sequencing. And it was about 1980 I got that prize. And now of course that same method is being used to do the human genome which there’s been a lot of interest in. And that is of course the ultimate thing to understand, the sequence and all the details of the DNA in human beings, and we hope that’s going to do a lot of good for medicine.;435;Creativity
The laboratory in Cambridge that was working on human genome project bears your name also, Frederick Sanger’s Laboratory. So how do you view this development in modern biology?;"It’s very exciting I think. I think there’s going to be a lot of use for medicine if we can really understand DNA and you know it is very complicated. There’s 3,000 million letters, as it were, in the DNA and you’ve got to read all that. And of course there are a lot of people working on that now to try and decipher the means and how it works. And I think that’s going to be of use to medicine. But we don’t know exactly what the applications will be. There’s a lot of talk of course in newspapers and wild talk about we’re going to cure all sorts of diseases and things.
Many promises.
Frederick Sanger: But you don’t want to believe that yet. But I think it’s sensible to understand that, you know, if you understand the thing better and if you know how it works then it will be of use to medicine.";435;Future research
What do you think, do you understand the concerns or fears that people feel when reading about modern biology?;Not really, no. I mean there are certain things of course you’ve got to think about. But as regards to the human genome the only thing that I’ve heard about is that some people may have to pay more for their insurance policies. And I don’t think that’s a very serious thing. I mean that’s a question for society to decide whether or what things should be used for. But surely it’s much more significant that one should consider what might happen, what good things might happen, that people might be more healthy and more happy. That’s what science is about, to try and improve conditions for humanity on this earth. And I think we should think about that ultimately. And against that you can worry a bit about what insurance you’re going to have to pay. And I think that’s for the insurance industry and not a very serious thing is it?;435;Role of Science
Modern molecular biology, it was very successful, not only in research and in science but also commercially very successful field, and biotechnology has developed since then with big commercial pressures. What do you think about that?;"Of course it’s I think essential thing that happens. I mean that is a question for society to decide, isn’t it? I mean that’s the way capitalism works, isn’t it, that people want to make money. And if they’re working on some good, useful work then that should be very agreeable. But it would be nice to know everything that’s going on and there is a lot of work going on now using the human genome work, which is kept secret now until it’s used.
So it’s not really the ethos of science.
Frederick Sanger: Not of fundamental science but it is understandable I think that people want to make money and we live in a capitalist world, don’t we, and we have to face up to it and it seems to work fairly well.";435;Role of Science
I have heard that at least in 1980 before your prize and about this time that you were quite reluctant to take in patents on discoveries in science.;I never had an opportunity really. I worked for the Medical Research Council and we were not allowed to take patents. And anyhow I wouldn’t have wanted to I don’t think because I wouldn’t want to keep my work secret. I was paid by the Medical Research Council and I had, I was paid for life really by the Medical Research Council. And that was my reward for the work I did. I don’t think it would be fair to expect to keep my work secret. And it was up to the English tax payer who supported me, gave me this opportunity. And I think that was fair enough.;435;Role of Science
I have another question. Einstein, people say that Einstein had a strong religious belief and you’re a Quaker. What is the place of religion within your scientific philosophy?;"Well, that’s rather difficult to say I think. I was brought up as a Quaker. My father was a Quaker and I think I was never actually a sort of Quaker, I was never a member of the Society of Friends. And when I got to university and stuff and started studying science I gradually lost interest really in religion and Quakerism. But it has influenced I think my philosophy in two ways really. The Quakers are pacifists. They will not take human life. And I still go along with that, and I believe that.
And the Quakers are also very keen on truth and they believe in fundamental truth is one of the virtues. And I was brought up with that philosophy, that I must not tell lies when I was a little boy. And I think this is very important for scientists, because a scientist is really studying truth and you’ve got to be very certain about what you say is truthful. And I think this is a philosophy which is worthwhile because a lot of people I think nowadays are quite happy to say something that’s wrong and it can get them into difficulty and it can get other people into difficulty. I actually have a sort of fixation about it rather, even when somebody asks me, you know they say to me how are you Fred? And I say oh I’m terrible. I should say I’m fine thanks. It’s a standard thing.
It’s a convention.
Frederick Sanger: If I’m not, I find it a little difficult to say that.";435;Personal Characteristics
You have now left science and you have been retired in 20 years as you said before, but you have developed some other interests as gardening and as you call it ‘messing about in boats’. What do you do when you’re messing about?;"Well, I used to do a bit of sailing and messing about really. I had a boat, a sailing boat, and I had a motor boat. Now I have given up sailing, I don’t do any sailing, but I still have a motor boat and I go on the river and mess about, just being on the river and cruising away from the roads is very pleasant. But gardening is what I do mostly and just living it.
Are you a successful gardener?
… I’m actually much busier, I think, than I was when I was working …
Frederick Sanger: No, I find it’s … no I’m actually much busier, I think, than I was when I was working because I’ve got time to do all sorts of things. I was going to do lots of different things like painting and building. And I used to do a lot of carpentry at one time, used to do a lot of carpentry. I find that there’s too many things to do. And I’ve got rather a large garden and that takes most of my time now.
So what is your biggest success in the garden?
Frederick Sanger: Biggest success? I don’t know really. I think just enjoying myself. And it’s nice for my family.";435;Life

Where does your passion for science come from?;Moungi Bawendi: I was born in Paris and my father was a mathematician – became a professor in mathematics. My mother was a high school teacher in math. Eventually when we moved to the US she became a computer scientist. My maternal grandfather was a doctor. My maternal grandmother was a pharmacist, so you could say I was surrounded by people who had interest in sciences. As a child, my parents moved quite a bit, so I grew up in Paris, outside of Paris and in Tunisia for a few years, and in Nice in France. Then we moved to the United States when I was ten – West Lafayette, Indiana, which is a university town, and we moved back to Paris when I was 15, then back to the US and the same place. Through all these movements, you could say that one thing, which was a constant with science. The literature goes back and forth and everything else, but math and science is the same everywhere. I was pretty good at it, and I liked it, and so I kept on going with it.;303;Motivation
When did you decide science was the path for you?;Moungi Bawendi: I think I was a child when I decided that science was for me. I had a chemistry set and a physics set, which was really electricity and magnetism. I don’t remember when that was, but I was pretty young. I was maybe seven or eight when I started with these sets. I don’t think you could buy these sets today because I think they would be considered too dangerous for children, but I really liked them, they were great fun. I remember crystallising some solutions of some copper compound. In the electricity set there was a little piece of it that amplified the voltage and you could feel the voltage go up with your hands, complete the circuit. And you just learn a little bit of practical science this way. It was great fun.;303;Motivation
What do you enjoy about science?;"Moungi Bawendi: But for me, the curiosity is really the fundamental aspects of it combined with the applications. I started into science because I was curious about answering really fundamental questions about how the world works. When you’re doing science at the beginning, you’re asking very particular questions. Not big questions about why is there life or big philosophical questions, but why is a molecule doing what it’s doing and how can I use math and experiments to understand it and explain it? That always is something that … It’s like solving puzzles, it’s basically very practical science puzzles, figuring out what experiments to do, and then data comes out. I find it always so exciting when you get data and you start trying to answer that puzzle, to figure out that puzzle, especially when the data isn’t exactly what you thought it was going to be, and then that increases the surprise. It gets you into thinking about new directions.
This process of asking some questions, developing an experiment or a thought process to answer it, and in the process of answering the question, discovering new questions, I think that’s really the exciting part of science for me. In the field that I’m in, because it was a new field, every question was a new question, every answer was a new answer. We created to the community, my community created a new material or set of new materials which had properties that didn’t really exist before. When that happens, then you start thinking about, okay, what are they good for? Can we use them for something? That aspect of it became also very interesting, so even though at the beginning I wasn’t thinking, as a young person, I wasn’t thinking about the applications, I was only thinking about why does the world work the way it does? After a while, I started thinking, what is it good for? What can I do with it? That process, to me is very exciting, because it allows you to learn a little bit about a lot of different kinds of fields. It allows you to see how your discoveries can touch fields that you may not have learned anything about before. In my case we were able to touch medicine, biology, electrical engineering – all sorts of fields that I really didn’t know very much about – but I found it very exciting to learn about them and how we could influence them.";303;Motivation
How do you cope with failure?;Moungi Bawendi: Sure, my science is often a process of failures. For instance, when I was at when I first came to MIT as an assistant professor and set up my lab, I tried t, in some ways recreate the atmosphere that I had been in at Bell Labs. I hired a student that was more synthetically inclined, and a student that was more inclined towards doing physics types of experiments, and another student that was going to do some magnetic work. These more ‘physicsy’ kind of students they needed samples, and the synthetic students was going to help provide samples. We tried to reproduce some of the things that I had done at Bell Labs, and it didn’t really work as well as I expected it to work. At the very beginning, I felt like things were not working, there was kind of a failure. The material wasn’t as good as I had hoped we could make it be. That process of having to overcome that difficulty of creating material that was good enough for my physics, more ‘physicsy’ sort of graduate students to be able to do experiments on, that’s what gave rise to the reinvention of making the material, making the quantum dots. Eventually that’s what gave rise to this work that was published in 1993, which eventually gave rise to the Nobel Prize. So that was a failure with a very good outcome, I would say.;303;Creativity
Do you have any other examples of failures?;"Moungi Bawendi: My first chemistry exam at Harvard was a disaster. I chose chemistry because I was very good at it. In high school, I had a great high school teacher, and I came to Harvard, and I decided I was never going to be a physicist because it was too hard. Again, this idea that I was an outsider, this imposter syndrome, you had these students that came from these science high schools from all over the country that were so much better prepared than I was. At least I thought they were so much better prepared than I was. There was no way I was going to compete with these students, but chemistry I thought I could do.
When I came into this exam, and it was in a very large room, a place called Memorial Hall at Harvard, it’s an old church, a church-like building. Averness, there was a bird flying around, there was a proctor who was administering the test, we called him Mr Test. I didn’t know that, but that’s what he was called by the students. The environment immediately was very overwhelming. Then I saw the exam, and I knew what the questions were asking, but I couldn’t answer them. At least I couldn’t answer them fast enough, it seemed. I went to the first question, and I got paralysed. I wrote a few things down, and I panicked, and I went to the next question and panicked, the next question, I panicked and looked around and got completely paralysed. I got a 20 or 23 out of a hundred, and that was probably generous, and that was the lowest rate in the class. That was a clearly a failure, I would say. But I knew the material, I liked the questions and I thought I knew how to do it.
The problem is that I didn’t know how to study. I didn’t know how to study for an exam, a timed exam in college. I learned how to do that, and one of the things that’s important is to spend the time to do it. I developed a very systematic way of studying for exams, which was time consuming, but for me, it worked. After that, I didn’t have any problems with exams. It’s a skill, it’s really a skill that students need to learn. I was asked recently about whether it’s a necessary skill, because research is a creative process. It’s not the same as taking an exam. It’s very different. An exam does not test creativity, it tests the ability to use knowledge from a class and apply it under time pressure. I think you need both skills, that exams are not useless because the studying for them requires you to really understand material very well, because then you have to use it quickly. When you’re doing research, the creative process, you need to have all that information available to you. Even if you don’t remember it, you know that it’s there and you understood it at some point, and once you understand something, it’s somewhere deep in your mind and you can recover it. I think both skills are important for success in research.";303;Creativity
How important is teamwork in science?;Moungi Bawendi: One of the things that is really important, I think, for people to understand is that when you’re an academic scientist you rely on students. The students, your advisees that you mentor, are the ones that are spending the time in the lab solving very practical problems, and you’re giving them vision. You have a big picture of what you expect to happen, and you can help solve problems with them, but at the end of the day, they’re the ones that are every second trying to do the experiments that you’re hoping will work out. They’re the ones that come back to you and say, Oh, it’s not working. What should I do? Or when they become more advanced, in this case, Chris Murray became very advanced extremely quickly, within a few weeks, or a few months, of arriving at MIT. They solved problems that you might not have been able to imagine were problems because they solved the problems along the way – so it’s really a collaboration between the professor and the students.;303;Creativity
Have you had any scientific mentors?;Moungi Bawendi: Immediately before coming to MIT, that would be Lou Brus, the co-recipient of the Nobel Prize. I first met him when I was a graduate student, and I had gotten a fellowship from AT&T Bell Laboratories to spend a summer, which my graduate advisor Takeshi Oka had nominated me for. Louis chose me to be the person to be in his lab for that summer, summer of 1987. I had no idea what he did. I came at Bell Labs, and I was first introduced to quantum dots then and to a way of doing science at Bell Labs. The way that Louis does science, which is recently to surround himself with a few really smart people, and to have really deep discussions about fundamental issues of science and solving problems and going in a direction that really nobody else was going at the time. That really influenced me for the rest of my career. He was a really important mentor for me. For the rest of my life.;303;Mentors (Role models)
What skills did your mentors teach you?;Moungi Bawendi: Patience and asking the deep questions and trying to get it right. Trying to get it right is more important than to do it quickly and get the wrong answer. To really get at the root of a question and to ask really broad, fundamental questions. And the patience also to get to the answer.;303;Mentors (Role models)
What piece of advice do you have for young scientists?;Moungi Bawendi: I think that what is extremely important is to stay curious. What I see is that you can be very, very smart, but if you’re not curious, then that intelligence and that innate ability that you have is not going to get channelled. You can be very curious and that can overcome any other deficiencies you might have in your background because you’ll learn what you need to learn because you’re curious. The curiosity of trying to answer the right questions or how the world works around you, I think that’s the key, it’s really the key to success. By curiosity, I don’t mean just curiosity about some fundamental question, I really mean curiosity about how things work generally. For instance, when you set up an experiment, curiosity about how the experiment actually works, how does the equipment that you use to do the experiment work? That kind of curiosity is a very practical kind of curiosity. When things go wrong, then you know how to fix it, or you know why things might have gotten wrong in a certain way. I would say there are two levels of curiosity: this very practical curiosity of how the experiment actually runs, how it works, so that you can create new experiments, make it better, and then the curiosity of the questions themselves, why does the world work the way it is? Those are two very different, seemingly very different kinds of questions, the practical ones and the broad, more philosophical ones, but I think they reflect the same sort of innate curiosity that humans have.;303;Advice for young scientists
How has your international background influenced you?;"Moungi Bawendi: Moving around has influenced me in a number of ways. It influenced me personally, in that as a child, I never really felt like I fit in anywhere. Starting as in France, having a French mother and a Tunisian father, and then moving to the Tunisia where my mother was French again, I wasn’t really Tunisian in the same way as somebody from Tunisia. Then moving to the US where nobody knew where Tunisia was in the US, I remember somebody telling me, Oh, Tunisia, they said, Oh, Tasmania, how interesting. They had no idea. And moving every couple of years as a child, you’re suddenly in a new school surrounded by new people that really don’t know you, I think that made me feel a little bit like an outsider.
I felt like that in science also, but it also made me more comfortable to be an outsider. In the field that we’re in, the quantum dot field, at the beginning there were nobody else. There was nobody else working in that area – it was really being an outsider. I was comfortable with that, but at the same time, I think that – and I don’t think I’m alone in this – but I think it’s true of many scientists and for myself with my background, having moved around and not always feeling like I belonged, people can develop a sort of an imposter syndrome where they feel like, Yes, this is working out, but they’re going to find out that I’m not the real thing, right? So, I developed a bit of an imposter syndrome which I think I’ve had to overcome. It’s this combination of being somewhat comfortable being an outsider because you become a little bit more self-contained, and things are okay even if you’re not part of the club. But at the same time, the club is going to find out you’re not part of them. I think that’s been a big part of my life, and my career as well.";303;Environment
What advice do you have for those that feel like outsiders in science?;Moungi Bawendi: I think that, and I’ll go back to in terms of overcoming imposter syndrome, as in terms of advice for that, I’ll go back to thinking about curiosity, because really in the end when you’re doing science, fundamental science, fundamentally, you’re working for yourself to answer deep questions that you might have yourself, not to answer questions that other people have. As long as you’re true to that, true to yourself, and believe in yourself, I think you can overcome that, you can succeed. It all comes down to curiosity.;303;Advice for young scientists
Do you think diversity in science is important?;Moungi Bawendi: I think diversity in science is very important for many reasons. One of the reasons, for instance, is to inspire youth that may have no idea that that’s a possibility for them. I think that one of the most important reasons why you want to have diversity in science is to make sure that that path is one that is recognised to be a viable path for as many people as possible. I think it’s only by allowing these possibilities, to be very broad, that as humans, we can get and progress as fast as we can by letting as many minds as possible think about hard questions. I think that’s extremely important for that reason. I think science is international to begin with. Science, at least in the US, is one where there are many immigrants from all sorts of countries, so it already begins with a certain amount of diversity because of that, and we can further that diversity because there are people that are not well represented still in science for sure. Women are still underrepresented in science, in many fields of science, to a degree that is still to me shocking in some ways. We need to do better on that. I think we have a lot of work to do. I think there are positives because of the way that science is already in some countries – I’m thinking about the US – a way for people who may not really belong, say, in the business world or other places, to find a home. That’s been true for a long time. If we can take that idea and broaden it out, I think that would be a really good thing.;303;Diversity in Science
When did you first become interested in science?;Louis Brus: I was a small boy in the 1950s in the United States, and at that time, there was a strong effort to encourage people to do science and engineering. That was so-called Sputnik generation, in response to the Russian satellites that were launched before the American ones. I was always interested in science, and my father certainly encouraged me to do that. He was in insurance sales, not a salesman, but he ran an office of insurance. I can’t remember a time when I was not interested in science and engineering. There certainly were teachers that encouraged me in one way or another. I had a very good chemistry teacher in high school, and if I’d had a very good physics teacher, I might’ve gone that way. Almost every scientist tells a story, some story like this, where a chance occurrence had a big influence on their career. Certainly, I had good undergraduate teachers at Rice in science.;304;Creativity
What was your first job and how did it help you?;Louis Brus: My father felt that everybody should work, it was not good to have free time. It’s very different than the experience now for high school students in the United States. He went actually out and got me this job with the man next door who owned the hardware store. I was a clerk making 65 cents an hour, that was my salary, but it was very good because at school I was more theoretically inclined, and I didn’t have much experience with mechanical things, for example, I didn’t take cars apart, put them back together again. This time in the hardware store was quite good on two, learning about tools, but also learning about people. Everybody comes into the hardware store, you have to deal with the customers in any kind of sales job, so that was good. I worked, basically it’s hard to imagine, I worked – let’s see if I get this straight – 24 hours a week. Either two or three hours after school on every school day, and then eight hours on Saturday, and then two hours on Sunday. It’s a lot of working, there was not much time for anything else. It’s amazing that I could work halftime, and still do well in high school.;304;Career Devleopment
Were there any other experiences that influenced your work as a scientist?;Louis Brus: My time in the Navy was quite important. It helped open my eyes to the real world. Not many scientists in the US have any experience out of universities. They’ve been in the university their entire life. But I was 19, I think, and I finished my freshman year in Rice studying physics, chemistry, math, and then went off in the summer to train with the US Navy and the fleet, and in an old destroyer out of San Diego. All those experiences were extremely vivid in the real navy. I learned about electromechanical computers. During World War II they didn’t have digital computers. There was no software, but they had machines where this mathematical function was encoded in the shapes of cams. These were hardwired computers to solve one problem. The problem was how to aim the guns on the destroyer. This kind of experience, I went on an aircraft carrier one summer in the Mediterranean. I found out later the aircraft carrier was carrying many nuclear weapons, preparing for war with Soviet Union. Anyway, they said these summer training cruises had a big effect on me. When I went on to get my PhD and then began to serve on active duty in the Navy, but I was lucky to be able, I was assigned to the Naval Research Lab, which is in suburban DC and I was able to do more or less basic research there for the four years that I was on active duty. I got to learn a lot of things outside of academic chemistry, just the kinds of technical issues which are important in a mostly engineering laboratory. All of that was good. In those days there was a draft in the US so I was expecting to go into the service in any event. My father had been in the Navy in World War II, so that predisposed me. I went to Rice on Navy Scholarship, that was part of it. I never expected to be a scientist, I thought I would be a businessman like my father, and I thought I would serve in the military before getting serious about business, and that’s how I was thinking about all of this in high school.;304;Motivation
What made you change your plan and pursue science?;Louis Brus: It was my experience, undergraduate experience. I became more and more interested in science, and in particular I was interested in quantum mechanics. I remember my reasoning as a senior, I was thinking, quantum mechanics is so interesting. I’d like to study it some more just to learn more about it, even though I’m going to go off and be a businessman and not really use it. I was lucky that the opportunity came. The Navy gave me first a leave of absence to go to grad school, and then the Navy assigned me to work in the laboratory research at the Naval Research Lab. All of that contributed to my career, made it possible to be a scientist.;304;Motivation
What do you particularly enjoy about science?;Louis Brus: It’s the old-fashioned way of doing science. I like to understand how and why things work, and I don’t really love machines. There’re some experimentalists who really like to build machines, and they’re not particularly interested in the problem that they solve with the machines, to measure something. I’m just the reverse. We build machines in order to solve a problem that I’m really interested in, basically.;304;Motivation
Why did you decide to teach?;Louis Brus: I didn’t teach for a long time because I went to Bell Labs. That’s an industrial private enterprise, not the school, there are no students there, so I did not teach, but I was certainly missing teaching and missing being around younger students. That’s one of the reasons I came back to Columbia. I enjoyed teaching freshman chemistry at Columbia for many years. There are a lot of smart students at the undergraduate level at Columbia, and very few of them are going to become professional chemists or scientists. They all go off into med school or lawyers and all these things that people do going into business in New York City. But I’m teaching them the principles of physical science, probably the last time they’ll see them in their major, you know, and I enjoy that because the US does not need more PhD scientists. What it needs is every citizen to be somewhat scientifically literate so that decisions can be made. The science is not black magic – for many people it’s just completely black magic – and that’s not good for society.;304;Mentors (Role models)
How does it feel to be a mentor to many scientists?;Louis Brus: I think many people have the experience that it’s a fun and a delight to have a student of high scientific ability, that’s not hard to teach and picks up very quickly. Certainly that was my relationship with the Bawendi and with the previous postdoc in that program, which was Paul Alivisatos. Bawendi had started off graduate school as a theorist, and yet when he came to work with us, he was doing experimental work, mostly synthesis, and he didn’t know anything about it, but he had great enthusiasm, and he was highly intelligent, so he picked up pretty quickly. He had other people to mentor him around Bell Labs as well. The strength of Bell Labs was that there was always an expert nearby that you could talk to, so if there was a field I didn’t know anything about or that Moungi didn’t know anything about, we try to find the guy in the building who was the expert in that area, or at least knew more about it than we did, and then go and ask his advice. The culture was such that he was obligated to talk to us, not obligated to work on our problem, to abandon his own research, but to advise us. It’s a very quick way to learn, and you could turn on a dime, essentially, if you found a better problem. You could quickly switch your own research into this better problem without any prior obligations to the previous work, so it was great delight. It was a great fun to work with Moungi, that’s for sure.;304;Mentors (Role models)
What qualities do good scientists need?;Louis Brus: A lot of times in research, perseverance is important. Very often your initial ideas are wrong, and you try to do something – it doesn’t work – and then you have to reconsider. You may start in an experiment thinking that you’re going to show one thing, and it doesn’t come out that way, it points in another direction. You have to sit down and rethink. There are very few accidental discoveries which are immediately important to the entire scientific community. Someone told me this morning that the average time delay between a discovery in chemistry and Nobel Prize for that discovery is 30 years. That shows that it wasn’t considered revolutionary when it was first made. People were still struggling with it to figure out, is this good for anything or? It only becomes apparent over time that it has a real value. Any new result, any really unexpected result takes time to sink into people’s minds, so that they can think through the consequences of it. Most of science is not really conducted on this Eureka principle. I’m Albert Einstein, I sit down and I think through this, and I come up with a great theory which changes the world – that almost never happens, has not happened since the early days of quantum mechanics in world science. I mean, it happens. Structure of DNA was a case where they were able to … They were at the right place at the right time and worked hard on this structure and fell into it, the initial ideas failed. And they had help from the real chemists in Cambridge. So there are a few things like that, but not many.;304;Competencies
How important is collaboration?;Louis Brus: When I was in Bell Labs, collaboration was the basis of almost everything. You had a certain expertise in your own laboratory. I was a laser spectroscopist, I could do laser spectroscopy on many different samples. But to work on a given problem, you needed people who do electron microscopy of the sample, and people who understood separation science in analytical chemistry. You could talk to them and they would agree to collaborate with you because they thought it was an important problem and they could make a contribution that you could not make. It’s not necessarily true in academic life. In fact, there are many schools that pride themselves on the fact that they don’t really have strong collaboration among the faculty. Each faculty has its own self-contained universe, basically. But I always like collaboration better because to make progress you have to deal with the weakest parts of the experiment. We have to work on the weakest parts of the experiment even if nothing in our background qualifies ourselves to do that. At Columbia, we tried to institute a similar system to what we had in Bell Labs, and what existed at IBM before, a much more collaborative effort among the junior faculty who were part of the material science effort. The science is going in that direction, basically. My whole life, the institutions in the US have stressed interdisciplinary collaboration, people from different backgrounds forming a team to work on a specific problem and to get money from the federal government to work on that problem, because they are a team. In industry, industry will always form a … If there’s a problem in the industry, it works the same way, they’ll form a team. If there’s something wrong with the manufacturing or they’re trying to make an improvement to the manufacturing, they’ll form a team of maybe 8–10 people that have wildly different backgrounds scientifically so that each person might see the problem from a different perspective and can contribute to the overall success or failure of the team to solve that problem.;304;Creativity
Were you aware of your co-laureate Aleksey Yekimov’s research?;Louis Brus: This was the height of the Cold War, and the Russians were our enemy, and we tried to keep contact with the Soviet research effort, basic research effort, but it was hard. Yekimov was not allowed to travel to the West to talk about his research, His research was published in Russian, not English, and in obscure journals. In the beginning I ask around a lot of people what kind of research had been done on small particles. Nobody knew of any research, they was all zero. That’s the situation. I found Yekimov’s paper after a couple of years. I found his paper in translation in the American Physical Society, I guess American Institute of Physics used to do translations of some of the Russian journals, and I found an abstract, I don’t think it was the entire paper, it was just the abstract that was translated into English. That was a surprise. Then I wrote to them in the Soviet Union, just in surface mail, there was no email in those days. Just a handwritten letter to the one of Yekimov’s collaborators, Sasha Efros. I think I sent them a preprint of my work along with his handwritten letter. This was, as I said, in the depth of the Cold War.;304;Creativity
Does openness and collaboration aid science?;Louis Brus: Yes, for sure. You still have to have centers which are experts at doing specific things, like understanding the human genome and things like that. But taking the tools, those centers will much more open now about adapting tools from other areas that may give some progress on understanding the human genome. It’s certainly a big advance over what it was when I was a small boy and when I was a young student.;304;Creativity
What is your advice for young scientists?;Louis Brus: It’s mostly having to do with the choice of the problem. You have to choose what to work on. If you’re doing basic research, then you have to start off on one problem, and you don’t work on all the other’s possibilities. You don’t know in the beginning what the heck is going to work out better than anything else. It’s always have an open mind for, and a broad interpretation of what your goal is. In engineering, what people prize is the ability to make something cheap enough, which works well enough that people will buy it. You don’t have to be first, but you have to have a product which works well and is cheap, relatively cheap. But science is different. Science values very much the people who first think through the issues in a field which is completely unknown to the rest of the scientific community. If you start experimental work on something and maybe five years before anyone else picks up on it and realises it’s actually important. All kinds of examples in Nobel Prizes of people who invented effectively a new field that was not really … Their colleagues didn’t understand why they were working on it because it was so different than the experience in the cultural situation in their community. Therefore, they had five years to work on it, and work out the basic ideas without competition, so to speak. What science prizes is new ideas, and I guess the measure of a new idea is it affects the work of other scientists somehow. Either intellectually it affects the work, or they shift their fields in response to some paper that you published, or you invented a technique or a machine that could be useful in their work, even though that was not what you did, you just invented the machine. They decided how to use it for a really good problem. But anyway, all these different ways you influence their work, you influence the work of the community, and that’s what science prizes, that it goes forward because of these individual contributions.;304;Advice for young scientists
How do you deal with failure?;Louis Brus: In your own research you have constant failure. It’s rare that something works out well, and you have to sit back and reconsider and find a different way to do the same thing. In that sense failure occurs all the time. Drug industry, the huge amount of money spent in the drug industry on research and development, and almost none of it actually leads to new drugs because we just don’t understand the principles, what’s going on inside the body. You may have some idea about how this drug will interact with certain proteins, but the body is so complex that only God knows how it’s going to work once you put the drug in there, things like that. You can consider failures, I guess if you find trouble with somebody else’s work most scientists will step around it, not really devote their own time to confront the other person, unless it’s really a super critical issue or something like that. Because you’d much rather work on your own ideas and to make them, you’d much rather spend available time and mental energy working on your own ideas than spending your time and mental energy to dis disapprove what others have done is wrong, which it may be wrong. Anything really important will be picked up pretty quickly and reproduced in the lab. Many scientists will wait until something has been reproduced somewhere else in the world before they get serious about thinking about what this first paper has said. Because there are only so many hours in a day, you have to somehow maximize your chances, that you’ll do something important.;304;Creativity
What are your hobbies and do they help you in your work?;Louis Brus: I had a very good history teacher in my first year at Rice, and he opened up my ideas about history. History is really interesting, study of the people who have changed the world. I began at that point to study history, mostly American history. I became interested in investing at one point. My father left me a little bit of money, I never spent any time thinking about that, but then I figured I should spend a little time under trying to understand this investing so that we don’t make huge mistakes. I do enjoy gardening. My mother and my grandmother and my maternal grandmother were very strong gardeners, and I very much liked that. I wish I would’ve done more with that over time. If we lived in a house that had more sunshine, I would’ve been a better gardener, you know.;304;Free time
Where does your passion for science come from?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: I was born in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States, and I grew up in a household where science was very much a centerpiece. That’s because my father was a professor of physics at MIT. He had three daughters, and it was important to him that we would be exposed to science and that we paid attention to our science classes when we were children. At no point do I remember being told that I must be a scientist, but it was absolutely encouraged in our house. As for my choice of chemistry as a specialty, that did not really come to me until I was in college. Before that, I wasn’t really fixed on science. I think I paid attention to the science courses because again, in my family there was an emphasis on that, but I had a lot of different interests, and I thought I might be a musician as a career at some point.
It wasn’t really until I was in college when I thought about biology as a major, and I thought about being a pre-med student, and go to medical school after graduation and so on. But I didn’t give much thought to chemistry until I took a course in organic chemistry, and that was in my sophomore year of college. Chemistry just changed my life, and I just fell in love with the subject. I’ll just never forget what it felt like to find a subject that I felt very passionate about. I wanted to learn more, and I wanted to study, not because I cared about my grades at all, it was just because I really loved the subject.";306;Motivation
Was there a particular person who influenced you?;Carolyn Bertozzi: I have had a few influential teachers and mentors over the years. I would say the first important science role model I had was my high school biology teacher, and her name was Margaret Schwartz. She’s no longer with us. But she really turned me on to the field of biology. And then I would say the second important mentor was my organic chemistry professor that was David Evans at Harvard University, who just passed away about less than two years ago, I think. Those two people really brought the subjects of biology and chemistry to life for me. And it’s probably no accident that my own research career has been marked by the interface of chemistry and biology.;306;Mentors (Role models)
What do you enjoy about science?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: One of the elements of organic chemistry that hooked me on that subject was how visual the subject is. So understanding organic chemistry is all about understanding the structures of molecules, their shapes how they interact with each other. I’m a visual thinker, so for me, being able to understand a science discipline through vision was, I think, quite profound. It’s not hard to stay interested and curious in a field like organic chemistry, especially in the way that it intersects with biology, because there’s so much we don’t know about biology, about the natural world, including our own human bodies that we occupy every day.
There’s so much we don’t understand about how our bodies work and when things go wrong in our bodies. Like what is wrong at the molecular scale? So we walk around every day in one of the great mysteries of life on the planet earth. So there’s always unanswered questions and puzzles to solve, and chemistry is a very powerful tool for doing that.";306;Motivation
How do you cope with failure?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: I think a career in science inevitably teaches someone how to cope with failure. Science is, it’s like all of the regular problems of life get amplified in science because you’re inherently trying to understand the unknown, and you have hypotheses that often turn out incorrect. And the only way that you can find the truth is to do experiments and try and understand the data, and sometimes the data are not what you anticipated. So failure is a funny term because we use failure to describe events in life, which sometimes it’s not really a failure if you think about it at a higher level. For example, when my students come to me and they say, “oh, I tried this experiment and it failed.” And I’ll say, “well, why do you think it failed? Did you do a bad experiment?” “No, it was a thoughtful, good experiment.” “So why did it fail?” And they’ll say, well, because I wanted this to happen, but instead this happened, and then I’ll remind them, that’s not really a failure, that’s just an unexpected outcome from an experiment. That means you, you thought you understood what the outcome should be, but in fact it was different. That means that you have to rethink your hypothesis and you’ve learned something from that “failure”.
With that backdrop, I’ve certainly had events in my life that at the time I felt were obstacles, even failures, but in retrospect, they were learning experiences. One of those was during my PhD years as a graduate student, when my thesis advisor, who was a young assistant professor at Berkeley at the time, unexpectedly was diagnosed with colon cancer. When I say unexpectedly, it’s because he was only 33 years old. It’s just the last thing a person expects at that age. To deal with this illness, he ended up leaving his position and his graduate students such as myself and a few other folks were on our own to finish our graduate work unsupervised. In the moment, this felt like a pretty big challenge and also quite risky in retrospect. I learned how to run my own research project. I learned how to serve as a mentor to the other students in the lab who are younger than I was. I just learned how to basically manage a research lab. This turned out to be wonderful experience later when I started my own lab as a professor, but at the time I was a graduate student, it did not really feel like an opportunity, it just felt like a crisis.";306;Creativity
As a woman in science and a member of the LGBTQ+ community, what barriers have you faced?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: People often ask me if as a woman in science or as an LGBTQ person in science whether I’ve faced adversity specific to those categories. It’s hard to know as an individual what types of adversarial events I might have encountered. Because you never can really do the control experiment, right? So I don’t know what my experience would’ve been had I been male or had I not been a queer person. I can say that being a minoritised person in science has its challenges regardless of the minority group. When I was a student, there were people who were actively hostile to women in chemistry in particular, organic chemistry also has a historical culture that was not particularly welcoming of women. And when I was a PhD student women were a minority. Maybe one out of ten graduate students in my program was female.
I was the only woman in my lab. Most women were the only women in their labs. And I noticed actually that it was challenging for these women because the men in our labs often looked at the women as dating prospects. The interesting thing is the men did not look at me as a dating prospect because I’m a gay person. I found actually that that was of benefit to me because the men didn’t really know how to talk to me and think about me. And so without any better idea, they just interacted with me like a chemist or like a scientist. So in fact, I think that was a benefit, whereas the women that they might have thought of as a dating prospect was less likely to be thought of as a scientist, first and foremost. So it might have actually been an advantage for me since I was already minoritised as a woman to actually be a gay woman. I don’t know for sure. It’s just a hypothesis.";306;Diversity in Science
Why is diversity of all kinds important in science?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: Diversity is important in any setting where people need to solve complex problems and where people need to think creatively. So chemistry is a very creative endeavour. It’s very important that we have diverse voices, mindsets, people with different ways of approaching problems around the table when we’re trying to solve these important scientific problems. There’s social science that’s been done to quantify these benefits, and so that’s wonderful, but it really seems common sense that you would want to have as many different voices and as many different opinions as possible when you’re trying to solve a problem. So I’ve benefitted in my own research from having a diverse lab of coworkers right from the outset of my independent career. I’ve had very good gender balance in my lab, and I’ve worked to recruit people from other underrepresented groups people who might have historically been excluded from the sciences in the United States.
This might be people of colour, also people who are gay identifying or queer identifying. My lab has always been known as a welcoming place for folks who might think of themselves as being kind of minoritised. I always thought that this was my not so hidden superpower. People have asked me many times over the years: what was the recipe for success for you in your lab? It was very simple. It was diversity. Now I think being recognised with a Nobel Prize is the best validation I could ever have to reflect on the power of that diversity.";306;Diversity in Science
How can you create an open and accepting work environment?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: It’s actually not hard to create a work environment that’s welcoming to a diverse group of people. It takes attention and it takes good listening skills and communication is very important because you’re bringing people together who might not have had experience communicating with one another before. So just making it clear from the outset that this is a guiding philosophy of my lab. People who work in my lab have to understand that these are my values and these are the values of our lab. Then when friction arises, which inevitably it does, when you have different people working together, there will always be some friction, but that friction can be translated into creative energy. It’s a matter of fostering open communication, being a very open person myself, making it clear to people in my lab that it’s a safe environment for them to communicate with me, even if they’re communicating things that are difficult for me to hear.
Being willing to accept criticism in a constructive way. These are skills that I think people should develop anyways just to be successful, productive people in the world and impactful people. It can start in my lab, but it’s been a process for me opening up my lab in a way that makes people feel welcome to come in, even if no one else looks like them. I think there’s always room for improvement. And I’ve gotten better at it over the years, and I’m sure I’ll continue to improve, but it’s been very worthwhile and rewarding.";306;Environment
How can we encourage more diversity in science?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: I don’t know that I’m more qualified than anyone else to give this kind of advice when it comes to promoting participation in science. But I do think it’s wonderful for younger children, school children, for example, to be able to see scientists who look like them. I think representation is very important in how we envision the possibilities for ourselves. So for a young person to see women who are successful scientists, for a person who is coming into their own gender identity or identity around their sexual orientation, I think it’s also very helpful to be able to see role models, especially since those people are stigmatised in many geographies, less so in the United States than when I was born 56 years ago. But still that’s an identity that comes with a lot of risk in different geographies.
Just to be able to see a person who’s comfortable in their own skin and has found a way to lead a successful and fulfilling life, I think this could be really profound. And then just existing as a scientist is not enough for me. I think it’s also important to be able to reach out and to communicate with people who are younger and thinking about their future. And then to demystify what it means to be a scientist. I think if you look at the public images of scientists, whether it’s in Hollywood films or television, scientists are often painted as extreme personalities and usually male personalities who are just different from the rest of us, either smarter than the rest of us, or weirder than the rest of us, or both. The truth of course is that scientists are the rest of us. There’s nothing really different about a scientist from a non-scientist other than a choice they made about their career.
But otherwise I think it’s great if regular scientists that are not in the movies, not characters on tv, but real people can take the time to get to know people who might have a misconception about a scientist. I’ve noticed that things that I say seem now to have more gravity, even though they haven’t changed at all. I’ve always said the same things, but for example, the day after the Nobel Prize announcement, my university had an event and they wanted me to get up and say a few words about the prize. And so I did, it was very spontaneous. I didn’t script this at all. And someone had a cell phone video recording and they posted a clip on Twitter, and it was about a one minute clip where I talked about the diversity of my lab and how that diversity created a culture in which we felt liberated to think outside the box and try crazy things. That tweet just went viral. There were thousands and thousands of likes and retweets and so on, comments. I realised when I read the comments on that tweet, and it wasn’t my tweet, it was a tweet from the person who took the video. I was reading through the comments and I realised that there was an appetite out there for someone to say these words. Lots of people have said words just like this. I have said words like this myself, for decades I’ve been saying the same thing, but now I’m a Nobel laureate. So it just gave so much more credibility to the idea. Watching that tweet and watching the comments from that tweet, it really sunk in that it’s a platform when you have a Nobel Prize.";306;Diversity in Science
What advice would you give to young women or people of minority backgrounds?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: For people who don’t see themselves represented in mainstream science, and so that would be women and also people from underrepresented minority backgrounds. For those folks, first of all, I will say when I was young, I did not see myself represented. I did not see women, successful women scientists who were decades older than me. There just weren’t enough for me to find them. And I certainly had no view of openly gay people as scientists or in any career, really, because I came of age at a time when there was so much risk involved and being out that people stayed in the closet. So I know what it feels like to feel like you could never belong in a place. And then what happened was a few people here and there opened the doors for me, and I had the great benefit of being born into a family where science was encouraged.
I didn’t grow up thinking I couldn’t be a scientist. It was only later that I worried about whether I would find my way. So, for a young person who’s trying to figure out how they would pursue this career path, even though not many people look like them, I will say, first of all, now that we live in a globally connected world where people can get on the internet and find information they couldn’t have found in their backyard, you can find the role models you’re looking for. They’re out there. You just might have to look a little harder than the room you walk into. So take the time to look online and do your research and find out who are the scientists that remind you of yourself. They’re definitely there. First of all. Second of all, find your advocates. So somewhere along the way, all of us had a handful of people who stood up for us. If you can find a few of those people, they might be family members, they might be school teachers, maybe a neighbour even or maybe someone they meet at an event sponsored by the Nobel Foundation, right? If you can find just a few people that can really help your confidence, I think. And then finally, as hard as it might feel to break into an environment where you feel you don’t belong, there will be a chance for you to pay it forward. You might not find a lot of people in your own generation, but if you pay it forward, there’ll be a next generation that follows you that will be larger, more robust, and more energised. And it’s worth it, I think, to stick to your dream, even if it means you’re more paying it forward than paying it back.";306;Advice  for young scientists
What advice would you give to a student or young researcher?;Carolyn Bertozzi: The one piece of advice I would prioritise for a young up-and-coming researcher would be… I would want to share with them how a life in science is incredibly rewarding. It’s rewarding because it’s creative. So you’re discovering knowledge and gifting that to humanity for all of posterity, because once you learn something, no one can take that away, right? It’s not an object. It’s an intellectual currency that will be shared throughout the generations, and you created that, right? And it has a permanence that ironically, a physical object doesn’t have. Or you can paint a painting, eventually it will fade, right? But knowledge doesn’t fade. Knowledge stays with us forever, and it becomes the foundation for the next generation. So that’s really exciting. That alone, I think, makes it worth it to become a scientist. But then on top of that, you have a lot of autonomy, and that’s something I have always valued, just the idea that I can govern my own activities, that I can pursue my own ideas and my own interests. There’s boundary conditions around it, of course, because someone has to pay for it and I have to convince them to pay for it and so on. But I have so much autonomy in what I do with science. Very few professions offer that kind of autonomy. That’s another great benefit of science.;306;Advice for young scientists
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?;Carolyn Bertozzi: The most important quality of a successful scientist, based on the people I’ve known, is resilience. So that’s the quality where you might be frustrated, you might feel like you just lost the game, but you dust yourself off, you get back up there and you go out the next day and try again. And science requires a lot of trial and error, and there’s a lot of confusion and frustration. But then you win a few. And when you actually have clarity on the science that you’re studying, when you feel you understand it, and it works as you had anticipated, nothing is more rewarding than that.;306;Competencies
Do you enjoy teaching?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: I’ve always had a strong affinity for teaching. I discovered that actually during my undergraduate days when as a senior, I served as a teaching assistant for the introductory organic chemistry class. What was so fun about that was I got to teach the students who were basically the equivalent of myself when I discovered my passion for the subject. I remember how it felt when I took the class and how I fell in love with it. When I taught that class a few years later, I wanted to create that magic for my students. And every once in a while, a student that I was teaching would have the same experience that I remember having, and they would come up to me after class and say “I’m a pre-med or a biology major, but I had no idea organic chemistry was so fascinating. I want to switch my major. I want to become an organic chemist.”
I thought, yeah, I recognise that feeling. Even now, and I’ve been teaching for 30 years or so, but I still teach that introductory organic chemistry class from time to time. And every time I teach that class, I try to bring back the magic that I remember when I took the class from Professor Evans at Harvard. So that’s part of the fun of teaching, is just reliving the magic, you know? Then, of course the students, even the students that don’t embrace the subject as a calling the way I did, I know in my heart that I have given them a foundation that will help them with whatever they try to do next, whether it’s medicine or science or something totally outside. I still think having taken on the challenge of organic chemistry and having learned what many people feel is a difficult subject I think is really enhancing for them intellectually.
When you teach a class, you always learn something, even if it’s a very rudimentary class, a very introductory level class. I always learn something new when I’m teaching. I’m preparing the lectures and I’m trying to find real world examples of, of that topic. Then I’m reading the news and learning some interesting recent story that I wouldn’t have necessarily bothered to pay attention to otherwise. But I actually have a very specific story about teaching, which relates to the Nobel Prize, which is at the time that we were trying to develop a new bioorthogonal reaction, and we were trying to figure out how to get azides and alkynes to react with each other, with very fast kinetics. The other Nobel laureates who share the prize with me were able to accomplish that with a copper catalyst. But for our applications, for bioorthogonal chemistry, that was not going to be useful because the copper catalyst was toxic to cells.
We were trying to do chemistry in cells and in animals, so we needed an alternative. I was teaching organic chemistry that semester, and I was working on a lecture for the next day, which was on the subject of ring strain. Ring strain is a very foundational concept in organic chemistry that I had taught about every year for decades. But until that moment, it had not occurred to me that ring strain was a concept we could use to get this bio orthogonal reaction to work. It all kind of came together when I was writing that lecture. The next day I taught my class, I gave that lecture, and then I talked to my grad students and said, go see if ring strain will solve this problem. And it did.";306;Motivation
What are your interests outside of science?;"Carolyn Bertozzi: I’ve always loved music. My parents, my mother signed myself and my sisters up for piano lessons when we were six years old or something. So I played the piano all through childhood. Then in high school, I had an amazing music teacher named Sandy Peasley in Lexington High School, and she introduced me to jazz, which was amazing because that’s a very creative form of music. So I played in jazz bands throughout high school and on the side I would play rock and roll and pop music just for fun by myself. But when I went to college I got involved in a freshman band. I met a drummer who lived in the same dorm, and we started this band and we weren’t very good. But one of our gigs was at a local college party and another Harvard student was there, and he heard our band play, and he was starting his own band. He was an amazing musician. This person is Tom Morello, and Tom was two years ahead of me in college, and he recruited me to join his band. The name of our band was Bored of Education, B-O-R-E-D. We thought that was quite clever at the time.
We played that year in this band, and we won the Battle of the Bands and we played some of his original compositions. People will recognise Tom Morello’s name because he went on to become a very famous rock musician. He formed a band called Rage Against the Machine, which was an award-winning heavy metal band. Later he formed a second band called Audioslave. And right now he still performs with Rage. I think they’re back together touring. He also does solo unplugged recordings and he plays with other bands. He’s very famous, very well known. At the time, I think you could have predicted it because he was a phenomenal musician, even when he was just 19 years old.
I still play the piano by myself with my headset on late at night as a relaxation activity. From time to time I wonder whether I could convince some other professors to get together and form a band with me, because there’s actually a lot of musical talent in the academic science world and in my own department at Stanford we have a drummer and a bass player and a guitar player. So nothing stops us other than time.";306;Free time
How else do you like to spend your free time?;Carolyn Bertozzi: I don’t have a lot of free time, but I do try to make an effort to go to the gym. I’m an avid weightlifter and I’ve taught myself basketball during covid because that was an outdoor sport when all the fitness centers were closed. So I try to shoot hoops a couple times a week if I can. But any sport with a ball, I’ll try and probably have fun doing.;306;Free time
How did you find out about the Nobel Prize?;Carolyn Bertozzi: The chair of the chemistry committee called me and woke me up. And so I found out, at 01:43 AM… I took a screenshot from my cell phone because I couldn’t believe it. I said, I’m gonna take a screenshot and then I’m going to wait 10 minutes and then see if it’s still there. So I found out the way that everybody finds out with crazy phone calls in the middle of the night. Then there was the live stream, which I watched online and was on standby on the phone. Then the doorbell rang, and it was the media relations people from Stanford University, who were just ready to go, came into my place and set up shop and arranged interviews for the next 12 straight hours, pretty much. So that was a pretty crazy few days.;306;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What do you believe is the greatest benefit to humankind of your research?;Carolyn Bertozzi: My research as recognized by the Nobel Prize, was the invention of a field of chemistry that we call bioorthogonal chemistry. We developed that chemistry so that a person could do a chemical reaction inside a biological system. By that I mean chemical reactions in living cells or living animals, or even living humans. Right now, the most obvious benefit to humanity is in the form of new medicines and new ways of treating cancer. And so bioorthogonal chemistry has allowed people to build new kinds of pharmacological agents, new kinds of drugs that would be hard to build otherwise. And right now there is a human clinical trial in which bioorthogonal chemistry is being performed inside the body of cancer patients in order to deliver a medicine to the cancer and spare the healthy tissues. So I think in the field of medicine is where the biggest impact is right now being felt.;306;Meaning (Values) of Work
How does it feel to see your work having an impact?;Carolyn Bertozzi: I am delighted to see the work that came from my lab making the translation into new treatments for human disease. This was the dream of mine from my early days as a new professor, was to do something, using my skills in organic chemistry that might benefit human health at some point. I didn’t know whether that benefit would ever occur in my lifetime. A scientist rarely knows that. But now I’ve been working in this field long enough that I can see the possible new medicines that are coming from bio orthogonal chemistry, and I’m just delighted.;306;Creativity

Where does your passion for chemistry come from?;Benjamin List: I think, in general, that I’m kind of the enthusiastic person when I’m into something I’m very passionate and enthusiastic about it, I think I’ve always been like this as a child already. This passion for chemistry came when I was really young, like 11 years old or so. I had this, I have to admit, wrong idea that chemists know everything, they’re like enlightened beings, they understand the universe, the world and everything. Of course, the physicists now in the society always make fun of me for that wrong understanding because they think it’s the physicists that understand the world. Which is also not true because neither chemists nor physicists really understand the world and the universe and have the answers to the big questions that I had at the time when I was 11 years old. So anyway, that’s how I stumbled into chemistry. When I realised I don’t receive the answers there, it was already too late and I was hooked and I loved it. I loved making gun powders and stuff like that. You know, the usual stories.;309;Motivation
What advice would you give to any young up-and-coming researchers?;My advice would be to follow your enthusiasm. That’s my number one advice. I always tell this to everybody. I was always hopeful that I can make a big discovery. Most of us in this world of science dream of that and maybe also secretly at the back of our minds we also dream of receiving a Nobel Prize at one point. When you are really interested in this and making really an impact, then you should be aware that the time when you have a revolutionary idea has to feel lonely, by definition almost. It cannot be the mainstream. If it’s going to be the next big revolution, it will certainly not be the mainstream. And yet there is this 10% when they have just finished their postdoc and then they start their independent research. There is this tendency. “I want to do something that everybody else wants to do. I want to be part of the community,” but that is detrimental. I would argue to do scientific revolutions, something you should keep in mind is this loneliness you have to be able to hold.;309;Advice for young scientists
What do you think has made it possible for you to cope with that loneliness?;I don’t know. I have to say I was really frightened at a certain point in the early days of my career. I was pretty nervous. I felt like I’m the only one in the world right now who’s doing this kind of research. And then of course the question is, “is it because everybody else is smarter and they already know this is kind of not a good idea or is it maybe a scientific, revolutionary concept that I’m following up upon?” So I mean, you have to also be aware that it’s a required condition if you have a revolutionary idea to feel lonely. I would really say that it is a sufficient condition. So many people feel lonely because they have silly ideas. In my case, I was really lucky that the success came so early. It was my very first independent scientific experiment. I wonder how long I would have survived in that risky environment if the first few months wouldn’t have given success.;309;Creativity
What qualities do you think successful scientists need?;Curiosity is important. We really have to burn for what we are doing. Enthusiasm, I have mentioned, it’s the most important driving force for all of us, not only scientists. And yeah, passion. I think also an openness. Because after all, it’s not us who shape or create the world and the universe, but we try to understand it. So we have to be a little bit open to surprises and don’t enforce new ideas onto the reality. It’s not going to work.;309;Competencies
You often also speak about your team and I know that after the award, you hugged every single person in your team. How important is collaboration and teamwork?;"The team is of course extremely important. I love this interaction with my students. I try to have this hierarchy thing as low as possible. They should never hesitate to come and engage in a discussion with me. This is very important. I always say, and it’s literally what’s happening, my door is always open for them and I want them to challenge me. I wonder if this is even something that’s a little bit typical for Germans that your students, or let’s say your coworkers, criticise you as the boss. I think it’s part of our culture. It’s a little bit different from some Asian countries, for example, where you would never criticise a superior. But I think in the end, it’s a good thing. It makes science better. We always have to be critical with ourselves. That goes along with what I said before; you cannot enforce your ideas on the reality. Reality always tells you the truth.";309;Creativity
How do you think that we can encourage diversity in science?;I don’t know why, but in my lab right now, it feels like almost women are the majority. I think it encourages itself. Like once you have a critical group of female coworkers, then the other women dare to apply. I’ve been blessed throughout my career with awesome female students, graduate students and postdocs. In general terms, my view is that we should start as early as possible. First of all, even before we start, we should think about why do we want diversity? What is the reason we want diversity? Some people say because of justice, but I don’t agree with this argument. Our aim here in the Max Planck society, or in all top universities where we go for excellence, our aim of course is to foster top-level science. And how do we do this? By tapping into all brains on the planet, ideally, and not just into a small fraction. So that’s why naturally we need to be diverse. We need to represent the whole diversity of all humans in science, just because we want ideas. Not to be lost in talents that didn’t have an opportunity to get into science and then they became something else. So that’s why I’m totally in support of diversity in science. For example, when the kindergarten ask me, can you come and talk to our kids I go. I love to do lectures at schools. I went to a local gymnasium – that’s like a high school in Germany – and gave a talk in front of 300 ninth graders. And subsequently two of them joined us. They were kids, like 14, 15 or 16, really talented girls. I said, why don’t we do a little scientific project and you come here for weeks in the vacation or in the afternoon, or once a week to already sort of lighten the spark of science in them. And then they know, actually it seems like I can do this. That’s my approach to it. But I think we shouldn’t start at the end of the spectrum and just have a quota in hiring, for example, I’m not a great fan of that.;309;Diversity in Science
You seem to really enjoy being a teacher. Can you tell me a bit about what is it that you like so much about teaching?;What I like most is really the shared enthusiasm for science. So I’m enthusiastic about what I do and then I speak about it. Then I see the light in their eyes and I see, wow, they get excited. And it’s the same as what I experienced with my teachers when I was an undergraduate student in Berlin. My professor, Johann Mulzer, who I also got my PhD with, always used to be very relaxed, but one had the sense, this is like the most exciting thing in the universe that you could be doing. I don’t know how he did it. We were all attached to every word he would say. Sometimes he would casually ask a question and then the smartest guys would give the answer. And that for me, I’m very sporty and competitive – I also wanted to give cool and smart answers. So that was what brought me into organic chemistry. So I know as a teacher, we can do a lot. We can really spark the interest in students.;309;Mentors (Role models)
Speaking about being competitive, how do you like to spend your spare time? Do you do any sports nowadays?;We used to live just across a very old tennis club in Mülheim and my wife would play there and my two sons would play. After a while I felt like, “maybe I should also play a little bit,” and they were also encouraging me. So I started playing tennis, I think maybe 10 years ago or so. And now I enjoy it. I play once a week or so and it’s great fun. I also do lots of yoga in the morning, like body manoeuvres, and I enjoy this also quite a bit. It keeps you flexible, young, smart and open. So I’m open to fresh ideas every day. I think it comes from the yoga.;309;Creativity
You received the call about your Nobel Prize when you were in Amsterdam, weren’t you? Tell us about that, you and your family were at a café?;It was really a sweet event. I went with my wife to attend a great concert in the famous concert hall they have in Amsterdam, the concertgebouw. The famous conductor, Currentzis is his name, really a rising star and they played Mala. When I was a student in Berlin, I always went to the Berlin Philharmonics. I always loved classical music. At the time they had these cheap student tickets for five mark. I still enjoy this music. So we had this day trip to Amsterdam. We went to a fancy restaurant the night before and then we went to the concert and the next morning, my wife picked a fancy cafe, not a coffee shop. As I said before, it was just a regular cafe. And we were about to have great breakfast when the phone call came.;309;Impact of the Nobel on you
After you heard about the Nobel Prize, you were in touch with your co-laureate David MacMillan. Can you tell me a bit about that? What happened there?;"Well, you know the drill, right? They call you 45 minutes before the press conference and the 45 minutes is sort of the last 45 peaceful moments in your life. That’s I think the idea, right? That’s what they grant you. But in my case, it wasn’t like this because Göran Hansson called me again, like 10 minutes later and said, “Professor List, did you happen to have the phone number of Professor MacMillan? I cannot reach him.” So fortunately I have the number and I gave it to him, but then I also sent a text to Professor MacMillan literally saying “Dave, wake up.” Then a minute later he calls me and he’s a little bit tired because it’s in the middle of the night at the east coast of the United States.
I tell him, because Professor Hansson told me I should not tell anybody about the content of the phone call before the press conference, “Dave, I just received an important call from Stockholm. And they also tried to reach you. So you better pick up.” And then he goes, “Nope, I’m sorry, Ben. I don’t think that’s real. I think that’s a prank. I have students in my group. They always make these jokes with me. And I’m really sorry to let you down.” For a moment, I was a bit confused, maybe he’s right. But I told him, “Well, if it’s a prank, it’s a really good one. I mean, they have voice imitators and they really know what they’re doing.” So we hang up and he sends another text saying, “Ben, I’m really sorry, but this is a prank. I bet a thousand dollars against this is happening.” And I said, “Okay, I take it.” He still owes me the thousand dollars now.";309;Impact of Nobel on you
When you came back to your lab after receiving the news, you were greeted as a rock star. Can you tell us a bit about that feeling and that experience?;I get goosebumps when you mention it. It was really one of the most beautiful moments in my life. And it was so beautiful because of the fact that we were in Amsterdam, the people here had all the time in the world to prepare, right. And so my colleague Ferdi Schüth, our managing director right now, he was thinking, what can we do? First of all, they bought all the champagne they could get in the local areas and they bought 113 bottles. That was all that was there. We drank all of them, later of course! But he also had this idea that all the students put on their lab coats and go onto the balcony and that when I would arrive, they would all clap, and it really worked. It’s not the most beautiful place at our Institute. It’s lots of concrete and architecture from the city, but they brought so much joy and so much happiness and excitement there. That came back to me and then they saw how excited I was and that went back to them. What was so beautiful was that it was not just my group or just the scientists, but pretty much everybody from the Institute. And it gave a sense of satisfaction to the scientific support groups. The metal workers, the wood workers, the gardeners, the administrative people, they were all so excited. Finally, we see the fruit of all our work for all those years. It was really such an amazing day. I will never forget this, I’m endlessly grateful to the Nobel Foundation for that moment.;309;Creativity
In 2004 you and your family were in Thailand during the tsunami and you had an awful experience as your son went missing. Those experiences change one’s perspective on life. How has that experience affected you and how has your life perspective changed as a result of it?;It’s an interesting question. The thing is we all crave objects, I don’t know what else to call it. Like somebody may want a Ferrari or a Nobel Prize or a great job or the perfect partner. And we think that these, I call them objects, will make us happy. But when you are in a life-threatening situation, like I wonder, for example, sometimes how the patients right now in emergency units are feeling that don’t get enough air? You have a completely different perspective, all of a sudden, what will make you happy. And you realise just the ability to breathe is already such a beautiful blessing, right? And this almost dying in the ocean, and almost losing my family, that really for several months sort of fixed me in that I lost this desire for recognition that people cite me and that I get an award and that finally my great understanding is appreciated by the world. I completely lost it. This didn’t last forever. At some point I was again ambitious and I wanted to be cited by my colleagues and I was happy to get an award, but always this remained there in the back of my mind that I know the truth. I know what is important in life. And it’s definitely not the attainment of objects, even if it’s a Nobel Prize, I shouldn’t say this right. It gave me a lot of happiness and it gave a lot of happiness to so many other people so don’t get me wrong. I so appreciate it. But deep down, I know that this is not the thing that we all crave for. It’s being able to breathe, being able to enjoy life as it is, having a coffee in the morning as the sun is rising. These are the things that really matter and that make us happy. We should just open up to this. Now that’s my message.;309;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Can you tell us a little bit about your childhood. Were you always interested in science?;"David MacMillan: I was born in Bellshill and grew up in a small village called New Stevenston, which was located between two steel works and a coal mine. My grandfather was a miner. My father was a steelworker. I had a really fantastic childhood, I went to the local state school. It was an incredibly happy experience, it was just such a fun place to be. Great humour, fantastic teachers. We had great community – everyone would run in and out of each other’s houses all the time. My next door neighbours, I would never knock on the door, I would just always walk in. Similarly when I went to high school it was equally fun.
I wasn’t [always interested in science] to be honest, I always feel guilty answering that question. In fact I wanted a chemistry set when I was about eight or nine years old and I immediately destroyed it because I didn’t follow the instructions particularly well, whereas my older brother made all the soap and all the things you were supposed to do with it. So I would say I wasn’t exactly someone who was a classic phenotype who’s going to end up being a scientist. I was always a curious kid. I was always interested in new things. But I wouldn’t say I was someone who was obviously going to become a scientist.";310;Family/Home Environment
How did you end up going to university?;I’ve told this story a few times, but my brother was the first person I ever knew who went to uni and the only person anywhere in our community who went to uni and he got a bit of a hard time about it. People thought he was just being lazy – and that’s certainly what my mum and dad thought at the time! But he went off to uni, did physics and then at the end, came out and got a job. And the job actually had a salary that was higher than my father’s salary on day one. At that moment, my mum and dad, they decided that I had to go to uni too. But not only that, I had to be a physicist because that’s what my brother had done. So I think there was always encouragement to go off and do what you wanted to do. It was never that you had to go to uni per se.;310;Creativity
So you went to university to do physics, how did your passion for chemistry come about?;"Basically I was this working class kid. I went off to uni and it was just really overwhelming for me. I remember getting there and the physics lecture was the first thing in the morning in this lecture theatre that was absolutely freezing and there was no heating. So in the dead of winter in Scotland you’d be in this freezing lecture theatre, and when it would rain – which in Scotland it rains – the roof would leak and you’d actually get water falling on you which, for me, was just a really tough time. I went to uni to emulate my brother and it was just clearly not working.
But what for me was kind of interesting, was an hour later you would cross the road and I was taking chemistry as my secondary subject. It was this beautiful, warm lecture theatre. It was this great place to be. And I started to realise I loved this thing called organic chemistry. And the more and more I read about it, the more and more I really enjoyed it and appreciated it. And I think for the first time in my life, I really began to understand what, when scientists fall in love with an area, that was what it was like for me. It was almost like second nature. I’ve told people it felt like breathing at times. It was really straightforward which sounds kind of braggy, but I don’t mean it that way. I mean, just that there was no resistance to learning it whatsoever. For me, almost immediately I knew that was where I was going to go. It was going to be in organic chemistry. It was a subject I’d not really thought about or spent time looking at before. But as soon as we started learning about it was pretty clear that this was where I was going to go.";310;Motivation
Your family sound very supportive – can you tell us a little more about your relationship with them?;"I always tend to get a bit emotional when I get to these parts of these interviews. Starting off with my family in Scotland… I think I’ve said this before, we’re certainly working class, we didn’t grow up with really anything, but we had an incredible support system of parents and people around us who just thought you could do anything. So that was just remarkable in and of itself. My brother and sister, have always been exactly the same way, incredibly warm, incredibly generous, would do anything for you. And I think now in my family, we have exactly the same spirit.
We really care about each other. We know that family comes first. You’ve got to be able to enjoy yourself. You have to laugh. You have to have fun. If you don’t have that first, then you really don’t have anything. So I think one of the things which is maintained through all of my family is this closeness, generosity, but also support. But making sure you really have a good time together. I think that’s been pretty essential.";310;Family/Home Environment
Apart from your family was there anybody else that particularly influenced you when you were younger?;"I had a teacher who was in primary school called Miss McKean. All my teachers in primary school were fantastic, but she was someone who just really worked hard, pushed hard. She would always go that extra mile to try and help you out. I always remember for example she knew I loved reading fiction and other books and she’d come in and give me books to read and say, “I know you like this book. Why don’t you read that book?”, and so on and so forth. She was a great example of someone who went the extra mile, but she would always push you as well: What do you know about this? What do you know about that?
I think as an individual who really helps spark your imagination, in thinking about different directions you can see the world, for a young kid in Scotland, she was helping open the world for you. And she was doing it through talking about the world, but also getting you to read about the world. To me, I think she was incredibly important, but also really inspirational in the way that she went about actually being a teacher.";310;Mentor(Role Models)
Do you enjoy teaching yourself?;"I love to teach and I also love not to teach. I think, when I’m actually in the action of teaching and getting up front of people, I love to do that. It’s an incredibly fun thing. I think if you talk to almost any academic, they’ll tell you that the hard part is the preparation where you have to put in all the hours. That’s not my favourite part. I don’t think it’s anyone’s favourite part.
I think we all truly love getting up in front of a class. Just yesterday I was in the middle of teaching something and I could tell it wasn’t working. It wasn’t going anywhere. And I had to stop and go to the board, and start to try and engage them in a completely different way. All of a sudden you can see that they were getting it. It’s the best thing in world, you know, when you suddenly see that people get something for the first time and it suddenly clicks, I think for any teacher, that’s your favourite part. It gives you goosebumps a little bit. Whenever you can see people for the first time get that piece of knowledge that you know is going to be useful to them down the line.";310;Motivation
What’s the best thing about your work and being a scientist?;"One of the greatest things about running a big research group is, for the last 20 years I’ve been interacting with people between the age of basically 19 and 27 and I’ve gotten older and they’ve stayed the same age. So they keep that sort of freshness and that enthusiasm that you get to work with every day. You feel incredibly privileged in that way.
In terms of the science, my absolute favourite thing in the world is whenever we discover or invent a new reaction. That happens a lot more than you would think. Still to this day it catches me unawares. Last week, actually we invented a new reaction and I was just sitting in this meeting with 35 people thinking, wow, we didn’t know that this existed yesterday and today this will exist forevermore. That’s a truly remarkable, wonderful feeling. Just to be part of it and see it in real time and know that other people are going use it really soon and use it for making medicines and maybe making materials. That’s a remarkably privileged situation to be in to be at that forefront of that scientific endeavour where you can see these innovations happen in real time. So without question, seeing new reactions being developed and seeing it in real time, that’s my favourite part of being a scientist.";310;Motivation
Do you have one piece of advice that you would give to a young scientist?;"Am I allowed to give two pieces of advice? I’d say as a young scientist don’t hesitate to take chances, I mean in life, in general. When opportunities come along, one thing I’ve found is – it’s really difficult sometimes – but if you just decide that when an opportunity shows up just to go for it, even if you have incredible self-doubt just do it. In my experience, it always ends up being a hundred times easier than you think it’s going to be. I think we tend to hold ourselves back because we’re worried about what other people think, we worry if we’re good enough, imposter syndrome is just everywhere. I think the one thing that I’ve found has been really important in my life is to try and somehow put that on hold and go for things. For my life, it’s really been beneficial. Sometimes things don’t work out, but as a whole, it’s been great.
The second thing I’d say as a scientist, I would say that it’s never about the answers. It’s always about the questions. That’s sort of a bit vague. But what I mean by that is as a scientist, you can choose to work on thousands of different things. And from my mind, the most important thing you can do as a scientist is not to set off and work on something that at the end of the day, might be a curiosity to you, or might be somewhat interesting to other people. For me, it’s always better to think I’m going to spend my time and my energy working on things I believe are going to have an impact. You can do fundamental science and still have an impact on society. If you can merge those two ideas together that allows you to come up with questions of things that you could work on. A lot of times it’s not easy to have answers to those questions, but at least if you set out on trying to address the question at some point solutions will start to show up. You’ve got to have the questions and the good questions before you can ultimately get to those solutions.";310;Advice for young scientists
And what’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given? Was it the same?;"That was probably one of them – make sure that you’re working on important problems. I think another piece of advice I got from a really great friend whose name is Dennis Dougherty – he’s a professor at Caltech. He said to me, there’s a hundred thousand ways to get tenure. And what he means by that is there’s no one size fits all formula to do it. You have to go your own way and invent your own path.
I know that sounds cliche, but if you try and do things the way that other people do it, you’ll just end up being a bad version of that person. What you should do is try and figure out what it is that gets you excited and don’t worry so much about how other people are doing things. Just go off and follow your own path and trust your own instincts. I think that piece of advice for me was just remarkable at the time, because it gives you some freedom, to not worry about watching all these geniuses around you do their thing because you can never do what they do. That’s who they are. You just have to do your thing. As long as you stick to that I think not only will it work you’ll have a great thing. It’s much more enjoyable to do it that way.";310;Advice for young researchers
One of the joys of your announcement was seeing you celebrate with your research team. How did it feel to be able to share it with them?;That was an amazing moment. It was one of the other parts where I felt like the whole world was going to go nuts that day for me. I could sense that. So I decided, wouldn’t it be great if we still had group meeting anyway, because we always have group meeting in the morning. So I wrote this email saying, despite recent events, I think we should still have group meeting this morning, which was I thought pretty funny. So when I came into work, my whole group was there. They actually applauded me, which is the first time in ever they’ve been nice to me! Again it was a whole new world, but then we went into the group meeting and the group meeting was fun. We were presenting the science, but what was really interesting was we had all these photographers and journalists there too who were rolling around group meeting taking pictures of people while we’re presenting the science. So my group were all having a blast with the whole thing.;310;Creativity
We understand that when you first found out about the prize you thought it was a prank. Can you tell us about that?;"It’s a kind of sad story – a classic imposter syndrome story! I was lying in bed – I’m usually an early riser but this day, for some reason I slept in and my wife got up and she could hear my phone buzzing. It was about five thirty in the morning and she was kind of annoyed. It kept buzzing and she got up, and she goes, “It says here, Ben List is trying to contact you.” And then there’s a number that says someone who’s from Sweden.
So I get out of bed and I’m reading this and it says, “Dave”, and it’s from Ben and it says, “Call me.” So I call him and he didn’t say you’ve won it but he basically said, it’s happening Dave. And I was like, no, I really don’t believe this. I have some ex students who are in Sweden and my group are a very mischievous group. They’re the kind of group that would always be up for pranks. And they’ve either cajoled Ben List into doing this, or he’s part of the prank. He texted me afterwards. I said, “Look, it’s not, I bet you a thousand dollars it’s not.” And then I literally switched my phone off and went back to sleep.
Then after about maybe half an hour, I got up and went downstairs to see who had won the Nobel Prize. I looked on the New York Times to see if they had it and there was this artist rendition of Ben List, and someone who looked something like me and my name at the bottom. It was honestly the most surreal moment of my entire life. I almost honestly fell out the chair staring at this thing.";310;Impact of the Nobel on you
So you bet Ben List a thousand dollars you hadn’t been awarded the prize! Have you paid him his money yet?;You know – I come across as being classically Scottish – I haven’t paid him yet. I need to pay him. I think we’re going to be together in San Diego in about a month and a half. I’m trying to figure out if I’m going to pay him in pennies or one of those big cheques. But I’m definitely going to pay him. It’ll be the happiest I’ve even been to pay someone a thousand dollars. But I’ll absolutely make sure to make Ben square on the whole bet – I think that’s the least I can do.;310;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What will you do with the rest of the money?;"With my Nobel Prize money what we’re doing is we’re taking 100% of it and giving it to a new charitable trust I’ve started. It’s going to give money every year to underprivileged communities or classes for educational purposes, whether it’s for infrastructure, iPads, or to take trips to go to places they couldn’t go before. One of the great things is with all these invitations I’m getting, I’m taking all the honorariums from that as well and putting that all in the trust to build it up. So it has been a dream come true to pay it forward a little bit.
It’s one of those things where you realise that at some point there’s a little bit of your effort involved, but there is an incredible amount of fortune along the way. Once you know that, you realise there’s a lot of people who are not so fortunate, and you have to do things help everyone out. That is certainly the way I was brought up and certainly what I believe in going forward.";310;free time

What is the “greatest benefit to humankind” of your research?;;311;Meaning (Values) of Work
How would you describe the impact of CRISPR/Cas9?;;311;Roles of Science (Scientists)
Why did you decide to pursue science?;Jennifer Doudna: I loved math when I was growing up. Nobody in my family was a scientist, but my father loved doing puzzles. So we did a lot of puzzles. I was growing up in a small town in Hawaii and I loved the natural environment there. I found myself fascinated by the evolution of plants and animals that survived in that native island environment. This was long before I knew anything about DNA, but I thought it was so interesting that I wondered about the chemistry of natural systems and natural organisms. I decided I wanted to be a chemist. Then when I learned about biochemistry, I thought that’s what I really want to do. I want to study the chemistry of living things. I set off on that journey in college and kind of never looked back.;312;Motivation
Did you have a particular person, a mentor or role model, who really influenced you?;"I would say it’s probably first and foremost my father, because even though he was not a scientist, he was very interested in science and he read everything. He was an avid reader and a literature professor. He gave me lots of books. He gave me Jim Watson‘s book about the double helix as well as books by Harold Morowitz and a lot of classic writers who wrote about science for a non-scientific audience. He really encouraged me early on to pursue my interests. Later when I was in grad school, he was the one person in my family that when we got together, his first question would always be, ‘What are you working on in the lab?’ He would really want to know, like he didn’t just want a one sentence answer. He really wanted to get into it. ‘What are you doing and why are you doing it? Why is it interesting?’ So that was great.
Beyond that, I did have some wonderful teachers. My biology and chemistry teachers in high school were very encouraging. I had multiple great professors in college who also encouraged my interest. My biochemistry professor in college gave me a chance to work in her lab over the summer, which was critical, where I really figured out, ‘Wow! I love lab work. This is really great. This is exactly what I want to be doing.’ When I got to grad school, I really got lucky. I got into a lab of a wonderful person who now is a Nobel Laureate himself, Jack Szostak. He was an incredible mentor, very passionate about science and encouraging for all of us that were in the lab at the time. I feel like I really lucked out.";312;Mentors (Role models)
Were you influenced by your father to be an avid reader too?;"I have to say that in the roughly 10 years that I was pretty intensely working on CRISPR (like up until this year or 2020) I had to put a lot of things on hold. I’m an avid gardener and I gave up my garden. And I really stopped reading for pleasure. I had to mostly just read for work. Even trying to keep up with the scientific literature was very difficult. During that period of time, I had a young son, my mom was ill and then passed away. So we’re dealing with that. I was made division head in my department so I had a lot of administrative duties there. There’s this bunch of stuff. I really put all of that on hold.
What was really interesting for me was that last year in 2020, besides the year of this Nobel Prize, it was the year of the pandemic beginning. I think, like many people, I had to change many things about my lifestyle. I stopped travelling – I used to travel every week. Then I found that last spring, I just started slowly thinking, ‘Gee, I really ought to be composting.’ I started composting in my garden and that’s what took me up into my garden regularly. I started pulling a few weeds and pretty soon I had a very beautiful and active garden again. I loved it. I was in my garden every day and I had vegetables, flowers, fruit and lemons. It was really fun and I thought, ‘Oh my God, I don’t want to give that up again. You know, that’s too much.’ It was the same thing with reading.
There were a lot of very disturbing things going on in the US politically, so I had a number of sleepless nights. I found myself picking up books to help me kind of get through it. I love reading novels. I love reading science books. I love reading things that don’t have anything to do with work because I just I’m interested in them. Both the gardening and the reading are things that came back to me during the pandemic, and I’m going to fight to keep it in my life as we kind of slowly go back to “normal”.";312;Mentors (Role models)
How do you cope with failure and with unexpected problems?;"I sort of have three ways of coping. The first is that I always remind myself to take a long view of things; something that’s frustrating or disappointing in the moment, is it frustrating today or next week? I try to think about, ‘How am I going to feel about this in six months or a year from now, or 10 years from now?’ I also ask myself, in the scheme of problems in world, how big is this problem. Often it’s not very big. I try to remind myself of the context and I try to remember all the things I’m grateful for. I’m fortunate that I have a family, that I’ve had the successes and I’ve had my career.
That takes me to the second thing; I do really rely on friends, family and colleagues and I’ve been so fortunate to have a really great network of people who I rely on for support. I guess I actively now, even more than when I was younger, look for people that are going to be supportive and who I can in turn be supportive for as well. People that you can really build strong relationships with, I think is very valuable.
The third thing is because there was certainly some adversity when I was growing up in Hawaii, it sounds like a paradise, but it wasn’t. There were a number of issues when I was growing up. I had to learn to rely on myself. I had to kind of find an internal strength to deal with bullying, to deal with all kinds of name calling and resentment. I feel like I go back to that now, too. I kind of go to my inner core and I know that there’s a part of me that no one can touch and that no matter what happens, I know that I know who I am. I know what I value. If there’s adverse things going on there, there’s a part of me that no one can touch that way. That gives me some strength as well.";312;Creativity
Do you have any advice for young researchers or students?;"I honestly think the most important advice is to go for it. That means to embrace your interests, your passions, and really give it your all. I think that is what I’ve seen both for myself and [other] people. People that I’ve had the pleasure to work with in my laboratory, the most successful of them are people who are able to deal with their fears. We all have fears but sometimes you try something and there is failure, right? You have to deal with that.
I think for me and for people that I’ve seen that are highly successful, they deal with that. Each of us has to find our own way to deal with that as we just discussed. But I just think you have to embrace your passions. You have to really go for it. People that have been less successful in my opinion, are those that dabble in something, but then don’t really give it their all. They almost never give themselves a chance to succeed, as they back off too soon. I think for young people, I tell them go for it, find supportive mentors who will help you through the tough times, and then just keep going. Because if you have a good idea, it’s probably going to work out in some way. You may not be able to predict how, but you should just keep pursuing it.";312;Advice for young scientists
Today it’s the International day for Women and Girls in Science. Do you think diversity is important in science?;Diversity is really important in science. First of all, I think that if you want to have the best scientific outcomes, you need a lot of different brains working on it. We all come to science (or anything really) with different perspectives, skill sets, interests, passions and ways of approaching a problem. The more of that we have, I think the more likely there is to be interesting science that gets done and frankly, interesting solutions to real problems. The pandemic is one very real example we’re dealing with right now where thank goodness there was creative work done years ago on using mRNA delivery. And now we have these wonderful vaccines, but it came together very quickly.;312;Diversity in Science
Do you have any specific advice to young girls who want to go into science?;I would never want to stereotype, but I do think there’s more of a tendency by women and girls to underestimate themselves: ‘well, you know, I shouldn’t apply for that job or fellowship or graduate program because I’ll never get in.’ I feel like I hear it more frequently from my female trainees than from male. I don’t know all the cultural reasons for that, but I think it’s something that as women, we have to actively encourage both ourselves and other women and girls that might be following in our footsteps to actively put that little voice aside and trust that actually they’re probably better than they think they are.;312;Advice for young researchers
Tell us about the first time you met your co-laureate Emmanuelle Charpentier.;"She and I were both invited to a meeting in Puerto Rico in the spring of 2011. This was a conference sponsored by the American society for microbiology meeting that she might very reasonably be invited to. But for me, not so much because I’m really not a microbiologist at all. It just so happened that they were having one session on CRISPR, which at the time was a fairly esoteric area of microbiology, but interesting.
A friend and colleague, John, was at this conference and he said to me, ‘Oh, Jennifer, I’d love to introduce you to Emmanuelle.’ I had read her paper in Nature and it was a really nice work. I thought it’d be really interesting to talk to her. When I got introduced to her, she was this very chic woman that is quite petite and very attractive. I was immediately impressed by her kind of stylish, very natural look and fashion sense, not fancy but just really nice.
She said that she really had been looking forward to talking to me and I thought, ‘Oh, that’s cool.’ We had our session and then we went for a meal. She said, ‘Hey, I’d love to talk to you about the possibility of doing some work together.’ We started walking around old San Juan. The atmosphere there feels almost a bit French or European. It has these cobblestone streets and is quite lovely. She and I were just walking around these streets and talking about this protein, which at the time was called Csn1 and later was renamed Cas9.
We were talking about the possibility of working together to figure out how it was able to work in bacteria, to defend against viruses. There was a hypothesis that it might be a DNA cutter, but nobody had demonstrated that. How it would recognise viral DNA was unclear. That was really the basis of our initial interactions.";312;Creativity
How was it to work with Emmanuelle Charpentier?;"I loved working with Emmanuelle. She always had a great sense of humour, kind of a very dry sense of humour, even in email. She would say things like, ‘Oh, Jennifer, you have to excuse my Frenchy English.’ And I would say, ‘Oh my god, I’m so jealous of your Frenchy English. I wish I had Englishy French!’
She was in Sweden at the time. She was up at Umeå University so she was nine hours ahead of California time. When we were working really intensely on analysing data and writing a manuscript together, it was almost like working 24/7 because I would go to bed and she’d be getting up and she’d be working. By the time I got up, there would be a whole new set of things for me to work on and look at. It was just really intense and really fun.";312;Creativity
How did you hear about the Nobel Prize? What was your reaction?;"I’m embarrassed to say, I’d had a very long day. This is the day before the surprise of when it was announced. I had been at an all-day meeting. I was very tired that night. Of course I was aware about the Nobel announcements being made, but I just didn’t really think too much about it. I turned the ringer off on my phone and I went to bed. I fell asleep and fell into it very deeply. I woke up at just before 3:00 am, California time. My phone was buzzing and I could see that somebody was calling and then there were some unanswered calls and messages. I picked it up and it was a reporter from Nature magazine who I know, Heidi Ledford.
She said, ‘Hi, Jennifer, sorry to bother you early. But I really wanted to be the first to ask you how you feel about the Nobel.’ I was literally coming out of a deep sleep and I said to Heidi, ‘Oh my god, I haven’t had time to look at the news. I don’t know who won it?’ And she said, ‘Oh my god, you haven’t heard!’
I honestly got very nervous. I started to think that I might be dreaming. I said, ‘I can’t talk to you right now. I feel like I need to hear this from somebody official.’ I hung up and another incoming call was coming in and it was Martin Jinek, who was the scientist who did the CRISPR/Cas9 research in my lab in collaboration with Emmanuel, calling me from Switzerland. I answered the call and he said ‘Jennifer, oh my god. It’s just so fantastic as this is so exciting.’ Honestly, I have to say at that moment I knew it was real. The reason is that Martin is the most down to earth and humble person on the planet, and for him to be calling me at three in the morning from Switzerland, with this news, I knew it had to be real. Then of course I got connected to the Nobel Foundation, but that was the first five minutes of my realisation.";312;Impact of Nobel on you
What advice would you give to a younger version of yourself?;John B. Goodenough: Oh, that’s a difficult question! Cause I hope the younger version of myself that you are talking about would be a little bit brighter than I was (laughing) as a younger person. But dialogue, dialogue, dialogue is always very important. We both learn that way.;313;Advice for young scientists
How do you recognise a good teacher?;John B. Goodenough: First, if they are clear and understand what they are talking about but they also have to know how to challenge you. Not in a way that turns you off, but in a way that challenges you to turn on. So a good teacher always makes you do something a little bit more than you thought that you could do.;313;Mentors (Role models)
Do you see yourself as a mentor now?;John B. Goodenough: I go to the lab and in order to interact with my postdoctoral students and try to see if I can shape them to not copy but to ask questions and to think. We have to have a little dialogue because you don’t pretend to be the fountain of all wisdom. Wisdom comes out of dialogue so you have to develop the capacity to expose your own ignorance in order that they may discover their own wisdom.;313;Mentors (Role models)
What qualities do you think you need to be a successful scientist?;John B. Goodenough: First, don’t copy. Think about the problem and to remember that we compete against problems, not against people. Well as I say, don’t believe everything that you read and don’t be afraid to think and it is alright to understand what has gone before but don’t just rely on copying but develop your internal voice and your own internal means of interpreting. That is a very individual thing and there are many different ways to be successful. Some people are very good at building equipment, you got to be able to measure and you got to be able to know what you are measuring and to interpret and so on. There are other people who do theory and develop theoretical understanding. And then there are people who develop intuition. You have to have some scientific intuition as well. And every scientist is an individual and brings a different talent to the problem. But you have to be willing to dialogue so that we can all benefit from one another’s intuition.;313;Competencies
How do you cope with failure?;John B. Goodenough: We all have to recognise that we are going to fail sometimes alright, but some failures are more traumatic than others. (laughing);313;Creativity
How has your dyslexia shaped you?;John B. Goodenough: It meant that I learnt to love nature. It meant also that I would never have been a very good reader. You have to struggle to read as best you can. But you have to not worry, you have to just get out and enjoy life and enjoy what you can do well and do it as well as you can.;313;Personal Characteristics
How important has nature been for you?;John B. Goodenough: Well, we are supposed to love the Lord our God with all our heart with all our mind and with all our strength. But that is separate from loving our neighbor as ourselves. It means that nature is God’s creation. So we should love nature and understand nature the best we can in order to show our love for the creator. It is a wonderful thing, this nature, this Earth and its abundance and its surprises and its resources and its change. So for me, it’s just I am grateful to be a part of nature.;313;Impact of the Nobel on you
Has music played an important role in your life?;John B. Goodenough: I can’t say that I am a good musician. I am not particularly musical. But I got rhythm! (laughing) I prefer… you know… I like Bach.;313;Creativity
How did your interest in poetry start?;John B. Goodenough: I was to take a course in poetry but of course if you don’t read very well poetry is more difficult thing to really understand, metaphors and so on. That remark is the best way to teach somebody. You say ‘Well, alright, get going boy! Maybe you can do a little better!’ (laughing) So I had to try to see how will I learn to read poetry and I thought the only way to do that is to write poetry. And if you start to write poetry then you realise the problems you have to make the metaphors and so on. That’s how I started to write poetry. I tried to write a poem for my wife every birthday and every Christmas. My wife and I shared very much a vision of Christianity. So I would always write something that was relating to a character or to something rather of that nature. It always had a religious bend to it.;313;Motivation
How did you meet your wife?;John B. Goodenough: I was in graduate school and she came a little later on than my graduate school time. I was living in the international house and she was living in the international house. Girls lived in one side and boys in another. We met at the dining room table in between. She didn’t blow me over because she was glamourous. She wasn’t glamourous, she was just herself. She was very comfortable with herself so it was very easy for me to make a friend. You see, love has to do with friendship. Friendship.;313;Creativity
What life advice can you share?;John B. Goodenough: The most important thing is that you have a companion that you share the deep things of life. But it is always difficult for a man to understand the secrets to a woman’s heart. Well I think you should be enthusiastic about life. You should enjoy what you do and I say to myself each day: “Help us oh lord, so long as we live to live nobly and to the good cheer of our fellow man.” I think to live life to the fullest you have to be able to have dialogue with people who want to dialogue with you. I think you have to just be thankful for life and be thankful for people who like to engage in meaningful dialogue with you. Yes, I don’t think pessimism gets us anywhere. (laughing) Even though we main live in illusions we have to work very hard to fulfill our illusions as best we can.;313;Advice for young researchers
How do you remember so much of your life?;John B. Goodenough: One of the great mysteries of life is memory. I helped somebody who was trying to understand memory and the sources of memory and so on. But I learnt that it was a rather complex problem.;313;Life
How does it feel to be back in Stockholm after 80 years?;John B. Goodenough: My first visit here, that summer or that autumn was the autumn that Hitler moved into Poland. I am very grateful to the city of Stockholm and to all the people who are here and not only to this city but to what this city represents. Thank you all for your hospitality and for even embarrassing me by asking me so many questions I don’t answer very well.;313;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How has living through World War II influenced you?;John B. Goodenough: I realised the stupidity of war, the waste of war, the bravery of some. I believe not in walls but in building relationships, alright. If we can build relationships, we minimize the attempts to go to war. I think that science is an international language and helps to build the relationships that are necessary to suppress the greed and stupidities that lead to war.;313;Life
What is your relationship with your lab colleagues?;John B. Goodenough: My lab colleagues are very good to me. We enjoy working together in the laboratory but I don’t necessarily hobnob with all of them at recreation times. We do it in the laboratory and so on but that doesn’t mean that I don’t like other friends and that I have other friends too. I dialogue with them about other things than just their work. So if they bring me some lunch, we are having some lunch together we talk about other things. When my wife was living, she was a gracious hostess and a good cook so then we would invite students who couldn’t go home for their holidays always to come and enjoy their holidays. She would cook very well. I am afraid I miss my wife quiet a bit. She was very special.;313;Environment
What are the characteristics of a very good team?;John B. Goodenough: A good team is never selfish, it shares. Recognising that they do things together. I shouldn’t steal the intellectual property of my students and they shouldn’t steal the intellectual property of one another. You know, science is an international language. And I have enjoyed travelling all over the world and sharing scientific discussions with people from almost every country in the world.;313;Creativity
What is your relationship with Akira Yoshino?;John B. Goodenough: Well, we are not good friends in the normal sense of friendship but he has always been a person who has listened to what I am doing and reacted to it. We have had dialogue in the science together. In that sense we are good friends. For example, when I say well LiCoO2 is going to be a very good cathode he immediately comes up ‘yeah, but you got to join it with carbon!’ (laughing);313;Creativity
How has the scientific landscape has changed over the years?;John B. Goodenough: Science is an international language, that is one of the beauties of science. As so, there is always international interaction in all aspects on science. That’s why people publish papers and read papers in order to be able to interact and dialogue as best you can with everybody who is interested in the same kind of problems as you are. I am not an astrophysicist to continue with our exploration or a particle physicist who keep looking at what are the building blocks of nature and so on. But people do learn some things and even I learn some things (laughing). So my scientific landscape changes according to how much I have learnt in the last year. The science hasn’t changed it is just my understanding of the science has changed to come along.;313;Research
What environment encourages creative thinking?;John B. Goodenough: Quietness. (laughing) I mean you have to think, that’s hard work. You know some people can listen to music and think at the same time but if you are a musician they never want background music, right? You either listen to the music or you turn it off. (laughing) I suppose I do my best thinking when I am in dialogue with somebody about a problem. I think dialogue is very important for thinking. And sometimes when you have to write something up, you are dialoguing with yourself as you are writing something up and you think about things. You have to try to be clear when you write. And you have to try to be brief. Get away with the clutter and just get to the point.;313;Environment
What research are you working on now?;John B. Goodenough: We are still trying to get better batteries, of course, and I have some people who have come and are here with me at the moment. They are two people from Iran, Hadi and his wife Isl. They are polymer people and they are trying to teach me a lot about polymers. So you see, through dialogue with every people you have then you keep learning. They keep teaching me something all the time. I think I have some contribution to make, they seem to be happy to talk to me anyway and I am very happy to talk with them.;313;Research
What are your thoughts on sustainability?;John B. Goodenough: The dependence in modern society and the energy stored in fossil fuel is not sustainable. We have to learn to harness the energy that comes to us from the sun either in the form of wind or in the form of radiant energy. And we have to be able to convert it into electric power which we know how to do. But as diverse… you can transport electric power over wires over some distances but you have to have a collection site. But you have to be able to store that energy because it comes in at time scales that are very different from the time scales of demand. So that is one of the reason you work on batteries because they store electric power.;313;Meaning (Values) of Work
What future do you see for sustainable batteries?;John B. Goodenough: Well they have to come! But we have to keep working hard on it to improve it, okay? We haven’t solved all the problems yet but rechargeable batteries exist. Rechargeable batteries do a fairly good job but they don’t do as good job as they need to do so we keep working to see if we can improve them.;313;Future research

How did it feel to be awarded the Nobel Prize?;Frances H. Arnold: I think I was an engineer and a scientist from day one. I was very surprised and overwhelmed, terrified, happy, thrilled and bouncing off the walls. I was in a hotel room so I could bounce off the walls and nobody would see me. I was walking around in circles because I wasn’t allowed to call home and then after I called home, I could. I was walking around in circles because no one answered the telephone. It was a pretty thrilling moment. Then I really had to take a shower because I knew it would be a very long day.;316;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How did your family react to the news?;"Frances H. Arnold: It’s a bit of a funny story. My first phone call was to my son James and of course he didn’t answer the phone until a couple of hours later and his reaction, when he answered the phone was; What do you want mom? It was five o’clock in the morning and he was tired and so I said; James, I won the Nobel Prize and I can’t repeat exactly what he said here, but he said; Oh, my goodness! That was just … He was so thrilled for me and of course he jumped in the car and drove over to another house, where my other son was sound asleep and woke him up and then the two of them came to meet me at Caltech later that day. So, when I finally got back to Caltech, because all the flights were full from Dallas to Los Angeles, so I made it back about ten hours after the announcement. I made it back and Caltech picked me up at the airport and brought me to campus and all my students were spread out on the campus. They had made big posters. They were wearing their lab t-shirts and they gave me a standing ovation as I walked onto campus. It was really lovely. Then all my colleagues congregated in the chairman’s office and toasted me with champagne.";316;Family/Home Environment
What does receiving the Nobel Prize mean?;Frances H. Arnold: I’m still working on that one. It’s a fairly recent event and up till today, winning the Nobel Prize has meant a lot of work. Putting together schedules and hearing from many friends and supporters, hearing from my old babysitters. I have heard from thousands of people all over the world, many of whom I’ve never met who just want to say how happy they are for me. I’ve heard from many people I have met and have long forgotten, but I’ve heard from many people who I care about, so it seems to be a shared event. It’s not just about me, it’s about everyone you’ve ever touched in your whole life and people you haven’t yet touched but now will, as a result of this prize.;316;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How did you become interested in science?;Frances H. Arnold: My father was a physicist, experimentalist, and he loved fixing things and building things. He would allow us in the workshop every once in a while. I had four brothers so we were always competing: who would be better in math, who would be better at building things. I always had a flair for competition.;316;Motivation
How has your upbringing shaped you?;Frances H. Arnold: Well, for one thing, as I was growing up, I was shaped by the fact that I had all these brothers, some older, one is older and three were younger. So I learned how to hold my own with the bigger boy but also how to boss everybody else around. I ended up organizing the brothers a lot but we’re also very close. In fact, three of my brothers are here with me in Stockholm. And we had friendly competitions for many things.;316;Family/Home Environment
Was there a single moment you decided to become an engineer?;Frances H. Arnold: No, there wasn’t. Of course, as I was growing up, being a scientist was not on my list of things to do. I enjoyed science. I wanted to be a scientist, when I was a kid. I didn’t worry about too much what I would do, when I was going to grow up, but I tried lots of different things. I thought I would be a diplomat. Then I realized I had no diplomatic skills. I wanted to be a CEO of a multinational corporation, then I realized that was a lot of work, and I studied engineering because it was the easiest option and the easiest way to get into Princeton University at the time and I never left.;316;Motivation
What do you enjoy about science and engineering?;Frances H. Arnold: I love solving problems. I think science and engineering is a fabulous career for people who see problems in the world that need solutions. My talent happens to be in coming up with technological solutions to those problems, but there are plenty of problems for which we will need solutions, so I think that’s a lovely way to use your skills and creativity in identifying problems and then finding clever new ways to solve them.;316;Motivation
What traits are important to be a scientist?;Frances H. Arnold: The traits, that are important to be successful in science, include an ability to accept criticism. There’s plenty of it to go around and to benefit from criticism. If someone takes enough time to criticize your work in a constructive way and you are able to listen to that, of course you know you have to set aside the feelings of hurt feelings, say, perhaps that what I need to listen to what’s going on, why is this idea not coming across, what is the fault I have in the way I communicate the idea or maybe the idea really is lousy. But we have to be able to join the discussion.;316;Competencies
Is independence an important trait?;Frances H. Arnold: As a scientist and end engineer, independence of course is extremely important. You have to come up with your own solutions to problems, you have to come up with your own questions, if you’re going to be a scientist and really explore something new. On the other hand, teamwork is important. So this wonderful balance of independent creativity, but then convincing all these dozens of students to take on some of these problems and put their own ideas into it, is the balance that we have to master.;316;Competencies
Should scientists do work that impacts society?;Frances H. Arnold: I don’t think it’s necessary, that scientists work on problems of societal impact. There’s so many wonderful stories of how just curiosity has led to societal impact and that if you start off saying I’m going to solve climate change, huge problems or figure out how to purify water, you may come up with a solution or you may not. It may not be a particular person’s passion. I think science is beautiful and that those of us who have a passion to understand how the universe works, how communities work, how people work, how our minds work, just to understand that will also contribute to eventually solving the problems.;316;Role of Science
What aspect of science do you enjoy most?;Frances H. Arnold: I particularly like working on problem-solving. That comes from, probably, my personality but also my engineering background. Engineering is all about how do you come up with a solution to a problem but I should say that much of my work has deep science roots where, if we come up with a solution for a problem, what does that tell us about the underlying phenomenon? What do we learn? And evolution is such a great way to do this. I use this process of evolution to create new biological things that no one would know how to design. They’re too complicated but once I have them and I’d solved a problem, I can go in and do the reverse engineering. I can understand or try to understand how they acquired the new traits that they have and that way I can contribute to a more fundamental understanding of how biology works and how evolution works.;316;Motivation
Which scientists influenced your work?;Frances H. Arnold: I have done a lot of thinking over the last few months about the scientists and philosophers and writers who’ve influenced my work for the last 40 years. I’ve been strongly influenced by Jorge Luis Borges, a writer, by the philosopher Dan Dennett and by a whole slew of really creative scientists whose ideas I recombined in some new way and it’s wonderful to go back and view those ideas and see in retrospect how they were reassembled.;316;Motivation
How important is a diverse background for a scientist?;Frances H. Arnold: The diversity of background that I have, which runs the gamut from studying Russian literature to aerospace engineering and chemical engineering, and I speak a number of languages, I’ve been interested in many things over my lifetime. I didn’t actually become a professor of chemical engineering until I was thirty years old. I was doing many other things before that including being a taxi driver. All those experiences, even if they were not the most positive experiences, made me who I am, and I think the diversity of experience makes me very different from everybody else.;316;Diversity in Science
What advice do you have for a young person starting their career?;Frances H. Arnold: I try not to give too much advice because specific advice doesn’t help. My path is different from your path but don’t be afraid of a path, take it. When you come to the fork in the road, take it. Do something, right, even if you don’t know what it is and where it will lead you. Do it. Do something and do it as well as you can. If you don’t like it, take another path. Life is not doors closing, it should be doors opening.;316;Advice for young scientists
Is it ever too late to become a scientist?;Frances H. Arnold: I think it’s neither too early, nor too late to become a scientist or engineer. It may be hard to study that math, but you could do lots of interesting things just by being curious.;316;Motivation
Why do you enjoy mentoring and teaching young students?;"Frances H. Arnold: I work in a remarkable institution, the California Institute of Technology. We have 900 undergraduates and a thousand graduate students. It’s really small and they come from all over the world, just in love with science, and that’s what they want to do. They want to do science and they want to do it at the highest levels. So I’m working with these tremendously talented and motivated people. Their ideas are phenomenal. They haven’t been molded into some hard set piece of clay. They’re completely open and their creativity is just waiting to be unleashed. So I get to spark that flame and watch that creativity just explode. How could you not like that?
It’s very much a privilege to work with them. They’re nice people, they care about others. It’s my job to provide them the resources to do science; the environment that lets them feel free to express this creativity; the support they need when it fails, as it inevitably does; everybody goes through periods of nothing works and then to give them the credit also when everything works and they graduate and go on to form their careers. I have 250 children as a result of this over the years, many of whom are coming to Stockholm and the ones who aren’t, have all, you know, participated in some way in this event.";316;Motivation
How important are your group and colleagues?;Frances H. Arnold: It’s all about the people. I’m one brain and sometimes there’s one brain that can do everything but that’s not my brain. But what I’m good at is encouraging 20 brains to work together and when you have 20 really good brains you can do a lot. So I like to bring those brains together. We enjoy each other, we’re friends and we like to celebrate our successes, so I have a group of many of those people who’ve gone on to other careers, who are coming back to celebrate this.;316;Creativity
Did you have a mentor when you were younger?;Frances H. Arnold: I had several mentors as a younger scientist. People, whose work I admired, whose ideas I admired and who encouraged me to go and try wonderful things. People who found me a job in Brazil in the 1970s and people who supported my PhD aspirations. Throughout my career I’ve been lucky to have inspirational scientists.;316;Mentors (Role models)
How important is it to be a good role model?;Frances H. Arnold: I think it’s enjoyable to inspire the next generation of scientists. I try to avoid the moniker role model because there are many things I’ve done that I certainly would not want to model for anyone. Life is challenging and we all have to go through ups and downs, but I would love in any way if I can inspire people to keep going through the hard parts. Science is not easy. This is a hard job and you have to be willing to take their criticism and you have to be willing to take those failures, but the joys far outweigh the difficulties in my mind.;316;Mentors (Role models)
How do you deal with challenges?;Frances H. Arnold: Well, I keep going because if I don’t solve this problem I’ll go to another problem, right? I love problem-solving but I haven’t chosen any one specific problem. I define my problems and if you define your problems maybe you can even come up with problems people didn’t even know were problems and then, when you’ve solved it, they realized, hey, that was a really interesting problem. So that’s one way to get around the problem of failure.;316;Creativity
How can we encourage and help women in science?;Frances H. Arnold: I think we’re doing, we’re starting to do that. What I’m finding is, that in my field in chemistry, there are a lot of really bright, strong women doing chemistry and they’re doing great chemistry. It’s a challenge of course to juggle everything. Of course, I think women are the best jugglers. I don’t know anybody who juggles more things than women do but we also take on a lot to juggle, so these are the challenges, to encourage women to take on yet more balls in the air and say you can do this and you can actually enjoy it as well.;316;Diversity in Science
Has being a woman caused challenges in your career?;Frances H. Arnold: I’m sure there are many challenges that I’ve encountered. I have to say my personality is that I’m blissfully unaware if someone doesn’t like what I do. I’ve always been able to say: Well sorry, that’s who I am and that’s what I like to do. I think that having the four brothers helped to dare. So many of the challenges, where people would look at my work and for example disregard its importance or say it’s not science, which is criticism I had early on, I could just say: Well, I’m going to do it anyway.;316;Advice for female scientists
Do you think more women are taking up science careers?;Frances H. Arnold: I think the progress of women taking on careers at universities in science and technology, the progress has been slow but it has been somewhat steady. It’s still not good enough. I don’t see the 50% parity that I see at undergraduate level, for example at Caltech, 50% of the undergraduates are women but only 20% of the professors. To some extent, that’s a time difference and maybe in ten years that will change but I’m not sure that’s the case. There’s something systemic that is holding women back from wanting to do this job. I think if they want to do the job they could do it and they could get the jobs but for some reason a number of them say early on: Well, I don’t want to be like you, I don’t want to work as hard as you do, I don’t want to have all these responsibilities because I’d like to focus elsewhere. It’s not easy to do everything.;316;Diversity in Science
What can universities do to help women in science?;Frances H. Arnold: It is something that the system can help with and many improvements have been made. When I had a baby in 1990, my university had no maternity policy because no one had had a baby before, so that had to be developed and now everybody has babies but that was a new phenomenon. And we had to go through the process of how do we support women, so that they can succeed and can have all the other things that everyone wants.;316;Diversity in Science
What is your advice for young women who want to follow in your footsteps?;Frances H. Arnold: My favorite advice for young women who want to do science and engineering is, by all means do it even if you don’t want to do it. Don’t leave it for the men because it’s so much fun. It’s fun, it’s important, it’s really thrilling to use your creativity to do useful things for people. Don’t leave it for the men.;316;Advice for female scientists
Do we need to encourage more people to take up science and engineering?;Frances H. Arnold: I think everybody needs to know something about science and engineering. Maybe they don’t go and get a degree in it, but we need a scientifically literate population. Science and technology is a future. It’s the future of the planet. Without science and technology we won’t feed 10 billion people, we won’t provide water or we won’t have cities that are even worth living in. It’s science and technology so everybody has to do it and most certainly women are going to play a huge role in the future of science and technology because that’s where 50% of the best minds are.;316;Advice for young scientists
What applications from your work are you most proud of?;"Frances H. Arnold: The wonderful thing about evolution is that here is a design process that works at all scales from molecules to ecosystems. One design algorithm that solved everything in life created everything in the living world. What I realized is that we’re just at the beginning of using evolution to move into the future. So what that means is that these processes, that we pioneered many years ago, have started to be used by hundreds of people, thousands of people to do very creative things with real applications. For example pharmaceuticals are being manufactured using enzymes that have been optimized by directed evolution. That’s important because they used to be made using toxic metals and processes that would generate tons, literally tons of waste products. Now they’re made using a clean enzyme process.
I brought here as one of my guests to Stockholm, a young man who started a company. He got his PhD in my lab doing directed evolution and he recently started a company that’s replacing pesticides with insect pheromones; it turns out if you spray a little bit of an insect pheromone in a field, you can confuse males. When you confuse the male insects, they don’t mate. No caterpillars, the crop damage is not there and it’s a wonderful organic replacement for dumping pesticides onto the planet, all made by synthetic biology by engineering biological systems to make chemicals that they don’t normally make. And these applications are thrilling to me because I see a sustainable future for the planet by using some of these design processes and designed molecules that nature invented.";316;Meaning (Values) of Work
How can your work help the environment?;Frances H. Arnold: I started my career back in the 1970’s working on solar energy when President Carter was our leader and the United States had a national goal of 20% renewable energy by the year 2000. It was a shame that that national goal of course went by the wayside when there was a change of administration and I felt that my career path in solar energy might be somewhat limited so I switched out of solar energy and went into biotechnology at the beginning of the DNA revolution. I stayed with renewable energy though, looking at ways we could replace pumping oil out of the ground and using biological systems then and I’ve stayed with that passion for replacing dirty chemical processes with clean biological processes for many years, because I care deeply about our natural world and how we can maintain a beautiful natural world, all these interesting products of evolution, lions and tigers and rhinos and monkeys and even insects. These things are beautiful, they’re beautiful products of evolution and we will be greatly impoverished if we do not make space for all these other things that we admire.;316;Creativity
Where do you get your passion for science?;George P. Smith: Originally I would say that I had a passion for nature, especially animals. Apparently I broke my parents in going to the Bronx Zoo and stood for like half an hour watching alligators and crocodiles that never moved and they needed to have a lot of patience with me. In 1949, when I was eight years old, we went on a vacation in Maine in the northeast of the United States. The place was like alive with snakes and I caught my first snake, a green snake, and paraded into the living room where my mother was entertaining a tea party of the very sort of like proper ladies of the neighbourhood who appropriately screeched and so on. I became very interested in snakes at that point. In fact, our family lived in Japan during the Korean War from 1952 to 1954. I and a friend, whose name I’ve long since forgotten, were both lovers of snakes and there were so many wonderful snakes in Japan at the time. So I thought I was going to be a herpetologist when I grew up and I would have, I think, except that my college, Haverford College, had only three biology professors and all of them were cellular molecular biologists and no-one was, you know, anything like a herpetologist so actually, professionally I abandoned my herpetology and I became a molecular biologist.;317;Motivation
How did your family influence your decision in science?;"George P. Smith: Oh, my parents are relevant in many ways. Scientifically I would say my father was very influential because he was an army officer. He was in the branch we call ordnance which is like supplies. It’s kind of like the business part of the army, but he was curious about everything. For example when we lived in Japan, every weekend he would be taking us on an adventure in the neighbourhood out off the army base where we lived and using sign language and expressions and so on to converse with a farmer like a peanut farmer or something like that. We’d so many times be invited for tea inside someone’s house. He was just extremely outgoing and curious about everything and especially about …
He went to West Point which is our military academy and that’s kind of like a technical education, it’s like an engineering education. And he was particularly interested in science engineering, things like that. I think that that was very influential in my upbringing as far as my science upbringing and being something that really encouraged that kind of curiosity and interest in how the world works, like how things work. That was one of his big things he would understand how, you know, gadgets worked and I think I inherited, or not genetically, but I was encouraged to have that kind of habit of mine from my father. So that was certainly a big part. Also my father was in the army. As I became politically active or politically aware in the 1960s, the war in Vietnam was a big part and my parents, despite the fact that they were an army family, turned against the war in Vietnam and this is a very, I think, perhaps unusual upbringing and in the army so that had quite a bit of influence on me.";317;Motivation
What do you enjoy most about being a scientist?;George P. Smith: You know, if I had to say the thing that has given me most pleasure over the years, is kind of like workmanship in the laboratory, like gel electrophoresis. Actually my postdoctoral advisor who was also a Nobel laureate, Oliver Smithies, invented gel electrophoresis as well. Any molecular biologist uses it all the time so, but to me designing exactly how you would load the samples, in what order, trying to design it so that the results would be really striking, that was really important to me. I took such great pleasure in the little tiny triumphs of two hours of work. I would say that was really important to me. Of course it was very exciting when sometimes I might have some insight that I thought was a breakthrough or thought it was an ‘aha moment’, those were very exciting too. Those were rare and the delight in workmanship in the laboratory was a constant pleasure to me, a constant scientific pleasure to me.;317;Motivation
Is it important for scientists to have mentors?;"George P. Smith: I think it’s very important in many ways. For one thing mentors help students, and early career scientists make their thoughts sharper, more concrete. They can also be a force of conservatism about their science so they also have to learn from their mentors, not to worship their mentors and not to pay attention, you know, not to think that their mentors’ word is gospel because sometimes the mentors are going to give them advice that’d be probably in the long run better to ignore. I think that’s something that, it’s very important for a mentor to get across to an early career scientist, a student, a postdoc etc. that you know you should … A scientist needs to be skeptical about everything. That I think is a very important lesson for scientists to learn. They have to be skeptical about everything, not to the point that it immobilizes them, but to a point where everything has to be looked on as provisional. Everything in sciences has to be looked on as provisional. I think this is a habit of thought that is really important in science.
A mentor also of course serves as a role model. It would be good to be a mentor that upholds standards of decent behaviour and morality and the conduct of science. I mean that for example … Don’t be a role model that’s like a cut-throat that cuts down in competitors /—/ looks on science as fundamentally a competitive enterprise because I don’t think it is. I mean science flourishes by a community of scientists, communicating their ideas with each other. Fundamentally, that’s the nourishment of science and I think that mentors owe it to their protégés to value this above all else in science. So how about me, am I a good role model? Well, you know I’d said that I think that a scientist need to foster the attitude of being skeptical about everything, so I think everyone should be skeptical about his or her own behaviour. So I think that maybe I’m a harsh critic of myself and I don’t value … valorise my own behaviour as a role model. I aspire to be a good role model but no one really reaches his or her aspirations.";317;Mentors (Role models)
How did you discover you were awarded the Nobel Prize?;"George P. Smith: I heard the news about the prize, well, it came at 4:30 in the morning in Columbia Missouri where we live and actually I have sort of a difficulty sleeping through the night that many old people do have and so I actually had come downstairs around ten after four to start the coffee for the morning and the phone rang and my wife answered it upstairs in the bedroom and apparently the call was, well, stand by for a very important call from Stockholm at which point the line went dead and then the call came through again. She answered it again and the same message and she called downstairs: “This is a call from Stockholm, I think you’d better get it!” So I did, that’s how I learned about it.
When I get this call I was very surprised. I do want to say that I knew that I was one of the hundreds of people that was on the radar of the Chemistry Committee and that’s because I was invited to a conference in the hundredth year anniversary of the Chemistry Prize in 2001, to a conference in honor of that anniversary. There were very few participants in the conference, maybe 20 or 30 or something like that, and all of us were invited to the ceremony and to the banquet afterwards. I kind of know what the ceremony is going to be like, although not from the point of view of an actual laureate. But that also alerted me that it was pretty likely that I was on the radar of the Chemistry Committee. It did come as a surprise 17 years later because I thought the time had long since passed. It wasn’t an, you know, a bolt out of the blue but is was a big surprise because I had long since thought that the time had passed.";317;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What does it mean to receive a Nobel Prize?;George P. Smith: To be a prize winner when you’re retired, because I retired from my university three years ago and I’m not doing much science anymore, so it is something to look back with, with pleasure and pride that this award has come. I’m going say in my lecture that I feel that I’m taking it, I’m accepting the prize as a representative of the science community that I belong to because many people in this community could equally get this prize but it certainly is an honour that I look upon with pleasure. Also, I think that my family looks on it with even more pleasure than I do and I should add that this is the first Nobel Prize for my university, a public university, the University of Missouri, and it is a great honour to my university. I think that all three of those are things that give me pleasure, my own pleasure, and the vicarious pleasure on the part of my family and my university and my science community.;317;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What is needed to create a supportive environment for research?;George P. Smith: In countless ways the science community is nurtured … it depends for its support on the wider community of society as a whole. It depends crucially of course on the schools that educate our children, some of whom will eventually end up in as part of the professional scientific community, their teachers. It depends crucially on our colleges and universities, especially the public colleges and universities including my own university, the University of Missouri, where children get their further education and that support the local science communities of which I was a member at the University of Missouri for 40 years. These are very important and also science, the well-being of science, depends critically on institution, public institutions, like in the United States, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health which supported my research and similar institutions in other countries, for example the Medical Research Council in the UK. Our science communities depend on public institutions supported by the people as a whole for critical financial support and for being … If we’re persuading people as a whole, that this is really an important part of our culture and the economy. That’s what we absolutely depend on, that kind of broad society support and university support is part of that.;317;Environment
What skills do young scientists need?;"George P. Smith: It’s a perpetual problem in science education, really in education in general, but specifically in science education is: What do we teach our young people to try to ensure as well as we can, that they could be successful in science afterwards? Do we teach them the specific technical skills that we ourselves depended on? That’s a question that teachers often have to grapple with and there are two sides of that, one thing is, I think, that students really need to understand specifically and concretely: What physical things support our theories about nature? What results? What concrete results are behind what we think of as our knowledge about nature so … The students really should learn about some of the nitty-gritty of experimental science, how we carry out experiments and how we look at the data and how we deal with the fact that inevitably data are messy and it’s not so clear-cut as if it were in a textbook. We have to, I think, educate students to be sophisticated about the relationship between physical findings and the interpretations that we give about those physical findings. I think that’s really critical.
I think also that students should learn about the fundamental ideas, the fundamental theories, theoretical understanding that underlies the science that they’re learning. They need to be educated in the science culture in which they are, in which they are learning and as I’ve tried to say before, also they need to learn to be skeptical about that culture, that it is not the last word and nothing in science is the last word about anything. They need to be skeptical about that culture as well. These are all things that I think a teacher has a sacred duty to pass on, to help to pass on to students as well as he or she can do it.";317;Advice for young scientists
What are your favourite applications of your research?;"George P. Smith: I’m often asked about the applications of my work and what their meaning is and my co-winner Greg Winter went on to use the phage display idea in very imaginative ways, not just him but of course his whole group and other groups that are similar groups carrying out similar research, use this in very imaginative ways that have turned out to be important for developing new medicines. A good example and a commonly cited example in the context of this prize is the Humira, which is a medicine developed partly using phage display technology, not buy me, but … that’s an example of something that has come from this.
I’m not sure, that I would say, that I myself, am most proud of that. To me a phage display, the technology that I developed, I saw that my vision at the time, as it matured over a few years, was that it would make a technologically very productive technology available broadly and cheaply and without a very strong technical background required, without the high demands, technological demands, available widely to researchers all over the world. I think that it is an aspiration that has been partly met because certainly many people have used phage display in ordinary laboratories, not in heavily funded industry laboratories or academic laboratories but in very ordinary laboratories as my laboratory was itself. It didn’t have a lot of money to spare but this was a technology that could be carried out by such a laboratory. That was a big aspiration of mine. I think it is one that has been partly fulfilled.";317;Meaning (Values) of Work
What do you do in your free time?;George P. Smith: I mentioned before that I’ve been retired for three years and I haven’t abandoned science altogether, I still go to lab meetings for a couple of collaborators at the University every week or most weeks. And I go to many of the seminars in my former department which wasn’t chemistry by the way. It was biology, I’m a biologist. It’s not that I’ve abandoned science altogether, but I also have continued a long-standing interest in my life, in I would say social justice and human rights. I would say that it started in the 1960s when I was a war resister during the Vietnam War and has continued on and off since then, so that’s become a very important part of my life, human rights and social justice in the United States for example. A major effort that my wife Margie Sable and I are involved in is the fight for a just health care system in our country, one that is universally available to all citizens and that does not bankrupt people that happen to get sick. So that would be an iconic social justice issue and that kind of issue is what engages me more now in my retirement life.;317;Free time
How does it feel to be a biologist who has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry?;George P. Smith: It would be funny to me, except that I’ve known many Nobel Laureates and I know about many of the prizes. I told you that I was at the ceremony in 2001. There was no Nobel Prize in biology, yet clearly biology is an iconic scientific enterprise and especially ever since Darwin really, it is a landmark scientific enterprise in the 20th century right from the beginning of the 20th century when Darwin was fully accepted by the biological community. And since chemistry is deeply involved in biology, it is pretty natural that many of the … that the prizes in chemistry that involved biological subjects are awarded to people who would identify themselves as biologists and also that really applies to physics as well because several of the physics prizes, I think, owe their salience to the fact they have led to applications in biological sciences. So yes, I think that it’s pretty natural that prizes go to biologists from both chemistry, especially chemistry, but also physics, not just to make up, but to the fact that there’s no biology prize and also Barbara McClintock who was a maize geneticist got the prize in physiology and medicine and who could be more of a biologist than Barbara McClintock? So the prize don’t fall into the neat categories that Nobel envisioned in his will and I would imagine that Alfred Nobel would be very pleased that that’s the case.;317;Impact of the Nobel on you
Can you summarise your Nobel Prize awarded discovery in 30 seconds?;George P. Smith: A phage is a virus that infects bacteria and grows to huge numbers and can be grown to huge numbers very cheaply, so it is a very convenient laboratory organism for experimenters to work with. Phage display tries to harness this natural device for searching through huge libraries of structures, tens of billions of structures, for structures that have a particular activity that the experimenter wants for some experimental end. As for example something that would … some structure that would bind to a receptor involved in cancer or autoimmune disease or something like that and might be used as an intervention for that disease. So it’s a technologically pretty simple and yet powerful way of searching through enormous collections of structures, for very rare structures, that have a desired activity.;317;Meaning(Values) of Work
When did you decide that you wanted to become a scientist?;"Sir Gregory P. Winter: I started to take an interest in chemistry because I think I was very good at it. I found it logical but it wasn’t absolutely mathematical. I liked the way it was taught which was very much based on evidence. We had a historical approach going through how all the scientific experiments were done that led us to our understanding of matter and the way elements came together, and I found that evidence, that trail of evidence, very satisfying, always thinking about what evidence you needed to justify any particular statement. But in fact, my real interest was also in biology as well and when I went to university I hadn’t been sure whether I’d be a biologist or a chemist but what happened was, about in my second year in university, I still preferred chemistry as a subject but I thought that, for research, the biologists just had the more interesting questions.
So chemists seem to have got themselves lost, in my view. They were exploring things that really didn’t interest me. They were kind of more mathematical, so endless dealing with equations, which I could do, but I didn’t get any pleasure out of them. To me a mathematical equation is just a tool for solving a problem. I had no interest in the beauty of mathematics as such. I was much more interested in some of the big problems in biology and I became particularly excited by … There was a book by Melvin Calvin about early evolution and which was published around that time, which was the late 80s, perhaps early 70s, and in that book was a description of how the prebiotic soup was formed and the way in which that is thought to have bootstrapped its way into life as we know it and I thought, now that’s really interesting, it’s all combined my interest in molecules. At the same time it made me think about the bigger biological question of evolution. In a way that theme has underpinned everything I’ve done at some level since then. It’s that deep interest in evolution, but also interest in the chemistry of how that evolution is achieved.";318;Motivation
What is it that you love about chemistry?;Sir Gregory P. Winter: We had a couple of very good teachers at school but, they were very good at teaching, neither of them were role models in the sense that they explained the subject in very different ways. The chemist was very competitive. We were always making us compete against each other to get the top grades, to answer faster than the next person. The biologist was more measured but again he would go out of area, he would get us to look at things that weren’t on the syllabus, went much wider than the standard school syllabus. So from both of them I learned quite a lot in very very different styles but they weren’t people I myself wanted to emulate, I had no model early on for the kind of scientist I might like to be. Only later when I started doing research did I start picking up ideas of the kind of people I’d like to be, the style I’d like to follow.;318;Motivation
Who has inspired you?;Sir Gregory P. Winter: It’s a combination of role models. My own PhD supervisor was a northerner and he was very blunt and I’ve borne in mind some little teachings that he’s given from time to time. One of them was I happened to say that an experiment I was proposing to do or a subject I can’t remember the exact issue, was really interesting and he said: “Bugger interesting. Is it important?” And actually that got me thinking, yes, he was right, it was interesting to satisfy your curiosity about something but no, he was right, it wasn’t important and so actually that was a guiding principle I incorporated to try to work on things that were important. Of course you have to judge what you mean by important and as my own research developed I realized the importance was very much in the eye of the beholder but for me importance started to become increasingly utility, in other words the ability to use certain things for the common good and to my mind, that’s what I started to think about as being important and that’s what I nailed my colours to in the end.;318;Mentors (Role models)
How did you react finding out the news of being awarded the Nobel Prize?;Sir Gregory P. Winter: When I first got the news I was very tired and I didn’t really take it in. It wasn’t expected and it didn’t really compute. I just felt it was a bit unreal and I think that continued for quite a long time actually, so people said: “Didn’t you feel elated?” No, I didn’t feel remotely elated. I felt just in shock. I’ve had other prizes and I felt elated but this didn’t fill me with joy, it filled me with an unease. I think the unease being that actually inevitably I would become much more of a public figure which is not something I really wanted.;318;Impact of Nobel on you
What are your favourite applications of your work?;"Sir Gregory P. Winter: The applications I get the most pleasure from are the applications that where people have benefitted. There was a big impact from a patient that … I’d made an antibody against a mark on white cells and this antibody was given to the patient and I wasn’t involved in making a decision as to whether to give it to her, but we did not know what was going to happen. In fact, there was some unease that it might be so powerful it could give very unpleasant side effects. In fact, there were very few side effects it turned out, and in fact the large accumulation of tumours she had in the spleen started to regress and on about the fifth day I was taken round by the scientist to meet her and I was told: “Well, to get in there, you’ll have to look like a junior doctor, put on a white coat, it shouldn’t say medical research council on it because it looks like you’re going to experiment on people, just a white coat. There’s a stethoscope, put it round your neck! Everyone will think you’re a junior doctor!”
So I went round and I got to walk straight in, no-one challenged me at all and went up to this lovely old lady, she was sitting knitting, and talked to her and I remember at the time, she asked me if I’d got any idea of how long this therapy was going to last and I said that we think you won’t react to the antibody because it was our first humanized antibody, but we don’t know for sure. And it, you know, frankly we’re just very glad to see the tumours disappearing but we don’t know just how long it’s going to go on for, you know, maybe it’s going to buy you a few days, a few weeks, a few months, a year or two. I simply don’t know. She said “Well, you’re very honest”, she said “It’s actually a pleasure to talk to scientists”. She’d been talking to medics and I suppose they were a little bit more circumspect, and she said “But all I really need is a couple of months.” I was startled: “Why do you need a couple of months?” And she said: “Well, my husband’s dying and I want to be with him when he dies.” I still feel choked up when I think about it now and I thought, this poor woman, there’s nothing she can do and yet we’ve done something that we can make a difference and you know we just have to … It actually gave me an increasing feel of worth for the kind of science I was doing and at that moment I decided I’d really got to make much more of an effort to focus my work on the practical application of those molecules.";318;Meaning (Values) of Work
What happened to the patient?;"Sir Gregory P. Winter: Her husband died and she was with him and she’d also mentioned that the other two months, the rest of the time she wanted to acclimatize her granddaughter to the fact she was going to have two grandparents dying very quickly. But she lasted a year and then, unfortunately what happened is, the tumour came back. We had no more antibody to treat her, well, we only had one lot of antibody to treat her and it was all in the hands of medics and they decided to give it to a child who they said was more important or it was the ethical thing to do. As a scientist I didn’t agree with that, because I actually felt that this woman was valuable experimental material. She’d also been the first person to have it. It had worked well in her case and I actually felt that we owed it to her to give her another shot of the stuff. But they said: “Well, I’m afraid you know you’re taking the scientist’s perspective, we have to take the clinical perspective and the ethical thing for us to do is to give it to the child.” And they gave it to the child and the child died and so did the lady.
It was all very sad and it made me realize that one of the issues that we hadn’t dealt with, we simply couldn’t make enough of this antibody on the laboratory scale where, I say we, it was really my colleagues, Herman Waldmann in the Department of Pathology, they were making this antibody and just the amounts we could make of suitable grade to go into patients wasn’t suitable and it wasn’t sufficient and I realized that we will have to work with industry to do it. So I thought, well, we’d just better grasp that nettle. I need to find ways of working with industry so anything I get in the lab can be taken through and we don’t end up with these situations where we’ve got antibody and we just simply can’t. We’ve not got a route forward.";318;Life
Why do you think scientists shy away from working across science and industry?;Sir Gregory P. Winter: Other scientists, I think they do their best but they probably … and it’s perfectly legitimate to say: Well, this is what I can do. I can do this bit and I need other people to take it forward. It’s true in my case. There’s a limit to how far I can go, but on the other hand I feel I should go as far as I can to make sure it is actually used and once it’s been picked up by industry that then, in fact, I don’t have to do anymore. I don’t have to keep to following it through. I don’t have to continue doing industrial stuff. So I actually would step back at that point. It’s quite exciting to see something going all the way through and I have always kept tabs on it but actually the most important thing for me has been to get involved to the point at which … If you’ve done something novel, you’ve got a new technology, then I can assure you industry doesn’t run over and seize it off you. You’ve really got to work quite hard to cross that gap to make them feel it’s worth picking up and running with.;318;Creativity
How do you stay focused on your research?;Sir Gregory P. Winter: I realize now my research has gone in phases so what tends to happen is I’ll have a period where I make some discoveries. I try to apply that, I take it forward, then having done that, I step back and try and go back and think of something else I want to try and in fact, that’s happened two or three times. So I’m now working on, or trying to take forward something we invented in the lab in 2009 which was development of mini antibodies which we call bicycles, bicyclic peptides, and we’re lashing on toxins to those and also trying to use them in immuno-oncology so those are things which again, it wasn’t possible to take those forward in academia, you know. To get into patients and well, to do all the preclinical and to get into patients has consumed tens of millions which is the kind of money you don’t get from granting bodies. You have to go to the market to get that and so therefore I’ve tried to, least sell the technology to people, to investors so they will come in and we try to take that forward with a company to a point at which we can see these things applied and in patients. And we’ve now got in the case of the bicyclic peptide, so it’s 2018, we founded the company in the end of 2009 and so it’s nine years but with technology development plus developing individual molecules, we’ve actually got a molecule in a patient now in the clinic in London which we hope will work out well. I mean so far, they don’t seem to have any side-effects but who knows. The kind of things we’re using potentially could be very toxic.;318;Creativity
How can we get more young people interested in science?;"Sir Gregory P. Winter: I think a lot of things have happened, certainly in the UK since I grew up. I think one of the problems is there’s much less focus on experimental work. With my own children, I was astonished to hear them say that chemistry was boring and I said, “How can it be? It’s a wonderful subject, it’s so exciting all these things you can do.” And they said: “Well, dad, don’t you realise, the most exciting thing we saw was a nail rust.” I said: “You what?” It turned out for whatever reason virtually everything is frowned on for health and safety reasons and possibly other reasons as well, maybe there aren’t the teachers to do it but in the state schools there just isn’t this culture of experiment.
In fact I remember going back a few years later to my old school where I’d done chemistry, and this was probably about five years after I’d left. I’d gone through Cambridge and I went to see my old chemistry teacher and he was surrounded by a class of 14-year-olds with Bunsen burners and things leaping out of the ends of tubes and things going pop and he was sitting there unconcernedly marking things and all round him there was kind of mayhem of boys doing this and that and adding things they shouldn’t have added and I realised you probably have to be quite brave if you’re a chemistry teacher but he kind of presumably knew all the various kind of serious risks. Occasionally a boy would burn their fingers or singe their hair and you know he’d quickly administer first aid and tell them to do what he told them to do in the first place, but I remember thinking this is what chemistry was. The room was full of smells, probably all toxic, it was full of boys doing things off stage and playing little jokes on each other but actually it got them excited and they really looked forward to chemistry and I remember thinking, what a shame that we’ve destroyed that.";318;Advice for young researchers
Is education in experimental science too timid? Is the focus on safety concerns legitimate?;"Sir Gregory P. Winter: I’d like the things I’d like to see people taking … Well, it depends on what you mean by legitimate. I mean I think providing that, you know, I think people should wear safety glasses and obviously you make sure that you couldn’t actually blow anybody up in a lesson but I think people are far too safety conscious, is my impression, but I can’t say I’ve been in lots of schools and I’ve seen lots of things. All I can do is to report back from my own children in state schools and I can tell you that there was a reaction I had many years ago to a biological experiment I did in school. I got invited to my children’s primary school many years ago to show them, you know, parents were asked to come and say something about their work and so for example it was easy for a carpenter to come in and show how they did, carved a piece of wood or whatever. But I went in and I thought I’ll show them an experiment but I needed to make it a couple of days’ worth.
So what I did was, I took petri dishes on one day and I agreed I’d go in the next day and I took samples of bacteria and we had a great time because it was a school in the country and we went round taking samples from the bottom of people’s shoes, from down their ear, up their nose, round the back of a young boy’s neck, on the school climbing frame by swabbing these different areas. I then also mixed this in some school disinfectant to see how that worked and then we plated the bugs out. We plated out the cultures and I’d done some initial ideas of titrations myself earlier on something, so I had an idea of the kind of dilutions you might need to make and anyway took the things home, put them in the bottom of the Aga oven which is a nice 37 degrees or so. The following day they were colonies on these different plates so I wrapped the plates up carefully in cling film and took them in and we scored the plates and we had a sort of big chart on the blackboard with the different sites, named the bottom of Johnny’s shoes, who always used to come from a sheep farm and he’d always trod on sheep shit, that’s just why the girls wanted to have that back of someone’s neck, someone’s hands, the school climbing frame, the school, the effect of the school disinfectant and there were certain things that ended up being very unexpected. First of all the school climbing frame was not the filthiest thing which I had assumed it would be. Nor was it the bottom of Johnny’s shoes, which clearly did have discernible pieces of sheep shit on them. It was the back of the boy’s neck and these things came up. I just couldn’t believe the number of colonies that came up. The other thing was that the school disinfectant had no effect on anything. So we produced this chart and I have to say the children loved it, particularly the boys. Two of them cut out: “Can I be a scientist when I grow up, sir?” They were transfixed by the idea that you could discover things that you didn’t know because they said: “We didn’t know what the answer would be because we’d had a bet and we realised everyone was wrong.” They’d all bet it was actually the bottom of this boy’s shoes and it wasn’t.
Of course the next thing that happened is, I have a nasty letter from the headmistress saying apologizing for the school disinfectant but saying the mother of the boy Johnny had been humiliated by this and this poor boy was going to get his neck thoroughly scrubbed and furthermore there was a hell that I should have done a health and safety assessment on the possibility that there could have been pathogenic organisms on these plates which children had scored and I said: “Look! The plates are sealed.” I had sealed them all round so they couldn’t open them and I thought to myself, these poor little children under that kind of culture. You know, this shows the dead hand of health and safety and bureaucracy in schools. It was such a shame because those boys were really enthused. I thought it was actually quite a good experiment, relatively harmless.";318;Advice for young researchers
What would be your advice for young researchers starting their career in academia?;Sir Gregory P. Winter: My tips for a career in academia: Work on something important that matters. That matters to you but also most preferentially will matter to other people as well and that someone’s going to put some money into it. I would say you will have to work extremely hard, harder than you have ever known before. You need to forget about work-life balance, you will have none.;318;Advice for young scientists
Could you explain your prize awarding discovery in 30 seconds?;Sir Gregory P. Winter: The prize was given for making antibodies using a filamentous bacteriophage and I’m going to explain it by analogy and I’m going to explain it by the analogy of a master thief. Let’s imagine that we want to make an antibody against a cancer cell. Imagine the cancer cell is being the lock and the antibody is being the key. If you’re a master thief, what you would do would be to create a huge number of different keys and then you would try those keys out on that lock and that’s effectively what we did. We found ways of generating a huge number of keys and then we found an automated way which was the use of the phage to be able to do many locks in parallel.;318;Research
Where does your passion for science come from?;"Jacques Dubochet: I heard frequently this term, passion, and it is not quite correct for me. It is just a requirement, it is a need. The need for understanding was my way of finding my way in life. You know as a young child I don’t think that I was a very special child, but sometimes you are afraid, life is sometimes threatening, the night, and understanding was my way out.
I was in Wallis, in a very catholic region, my mother was also protestant, actively protestant. There are two solutions in the world, one is the guardian angel, the other one is understanding. I will not say that the guardian angel is nothing, but my way was understanding. Then I continued and it is not just by accident that I became a scientist.";319;Motivation
How do you think that having dyslexia has shaped your life?;"Jacques Dubochet: In fact I think I thought more about this point since two months than all the time before. I got a lot of contacts with other dyslexias and with the association of dyslexic parents and so forth. But at that time it was complicated so I could continue during the college from, well say, eleven to sixteen, I was at school and I was still accepted at that school while I had marks which were not acceptable. In some sense this saved me but also its make that, it was you know laziness below. So instead of working hard I did nothing, relaxing on dyslexia.
But at sixteen then the director who gave me this chance not to be thrown away, went into retirement and I was thrown away within three weeks. But my parents made a courageous move, they throw me to Swiss Germany in a college there and within one year it was too late I would say. I had other methods to understand and to progress in life. It was a big shake-up and then from that moment it went well. The time before was a hard time, a sad time. You know, a young boy who does not know where to be in life. In this sense I feel quite happy to speak with young people who has trouble. And I like to say, to society, that there are a lot of young children who are lost because we feel they are out of the frame. But what can happen later is enormous, I am an example for that.";319;Family/Home Environment
What words of advice would you give your younger self?;Jacques Dubochet: Really, we all have something valuable in us, so cultivate what you have in you. When you are young you don’t know what it is, but you know what you like so go on with what you like. We don’t know to be good in everything, we just know to be good in something. On this stone you can build a life, I think so, or you need a bit luck and in order to bring me to Nobel Prize you need a lot of luck.;319;Advice for young scientists
Tell us about your passion to teach science and mathematics to young refugees.;Jacques Dubochet: Imagine you have a Somalian girl who came here, abducted by some terrorists. Was brought away and could come home again and then her father could send her away because she could not stay there and come in Switzerland and she is fourteen and a half. She come in a home for young refugees without parents. There she grows and she was supported. Then I work with this person and I teach her mathematics, two plus three and so forth. Then you have this two person, this person and the future Nobel Prize speaking for one hour in front of the other, just about trying to understand, trying to understand each other. That is impressive! Perhaps she learned something in mathematics, but I learned very much about human being. First of all, of course, what to say? There are so many words, the basic word of course … We are as different as possible, but we love each other. You see, this word is a complicated word, but there is in human beings the capability to love each other above all the difference. That is a big thing! The thing we should cultivate and make great!;319;Motivation
How can we interest the younger generation in knowledge and science?;Jacques Dubochet: I think that it is in human, in the biology of human, to be interested, not in science, but in knowledge. Understanding what is coming on. If I dream, if I walk, and just think about nothing. I think about what will happen, what is going to happen. I want to know what is going to happen. For that I need to understand a lot of things. The more I understand, the more I am prepared to go my way in life. This is the way the homo sapiens developed and became this powerful object which is making the world, for the best and for the worse.;319;Motivation
How has life been since you were awarded the Nobel Prize?;Jacques Dubochet: Of course it is a shock but I thought I don’t want to change. I thought I managed that, but my wife and my children noticed that no, no, it is visible that you are quite shocked. Indeed, two days ago I was sick, I didn’t understand what happened, but the Nobel Prize is a big shock.;319;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How did you celebrate the announcement?;Jacques Dubochet: At the first minute, the first afternoon, I was at my university campus. Everybody was celebrating, and they wanted signatures and photographs. I thought, what do they want with that? Then a young person gave me a packet of chocolate, a box of chocolate. And I told her ‘Allez, keep it, I don’t want chocolate’. And she took it again and she put it on me vigorously and said ‘But no, ça me fait plaisir’ – it is a pleasure for me! And so I realised so many people just are happy because I got this Nobel Prize. And this is surprising, all this people, I got now about 2,000 messages, the overwhelming majority you have the impression, the people are happy to be happy with you.;319;Creativity
How has your discovery benefitted humankind?;Jacques Dubochet: We got this Nobel Prize for our progress in imaging of molecules and we see now atoms therefore we are in chemistry and more chemistry is extremely powerful with that we can develop drugs to cure I don’t know what, understand how the brain working, conscience. I don’t know where we go. It is knowledge. Knowledge is our best common good. We should keep that as a common good. Any knowledge in the world should belong to everywhere. Which is not so obvious. Now the second question is what will you do with that? We are very good in producing knowledge, I am the testimony of that. But are we so good in using it, in using our knowledge for the best of all mankind? We have clearly very big progress to make on that.;319;Creativity
What do you like to do in your spare time?;Jacques Dubochet: I am retired since 10 years. I am still in my university, I have my small office there. I try to learn, I continue, I read. The best way to learn is to discuss with colleagues. Because instead of reading hard difficult scientific papers you just discuss and you get the explanation. That is a big advantage. As you understand I spend time with refugees or with people with less chance. We walk a lot, voilà, we are doing things that make us quite happy.;319;Free time
Do you feel that the day has enough hours?;Jacques Dubochet: No, no, that is the big trouble. Twenty-four hours a day is very much too short. Oh, là là. You see I am 75 and I still do not know how to restrict myself. Probably this has something to do with Calvinism. I am not at all Calvinist of course but nevertheless every minute you get, every minute is so precious you want to do something out of it. “Les minutes, mortel folâtre, sont des gangues. Qu’il ne faut pas lâcher sans en extraire l’or.” Baudelaire!;319;Creativity
Do you enjoy reading?;Jacques Dubochet: Reading, yes of course. Ishiguro, very good! All the family is reading him know. My daughter read him before, but we discovered him only since the Nobel Prize. It is a very remarkable thing!;319;competencies
When do you get your most creative ideas?;Jacques Dubochet: Morning, but no no! The right way, and I am not first one to say that is, is while walking. Before it was while jogging, now I am not jogging anymore, but walking in the forest. I think Nietzsche was saying things about that. Do not believe my great thing that I am writing on my desk are coming like that, no, they are coming while I am walking and from time to time I am able to keep them until I can write them down. That is exactly my feeling. Or under the shower! All my genius ideas are coming under the shower, but unfortunately, the minute after, they are no more genius.;319;Creativity
When did you get the idea for your Nobel Prize-awarded discovery? While jogging?;Jacques Dubochet: No, but the jogging was very important, yes. At that time I was jogging nearly every day, my ten kilometers. We were not numerous too. The institute was in the forest, it was a beautiful forest. It was ideal for that and we frequently went in a group. It was psychologically interesting, those who always want to be a bit quicker and those who are running three meters behind or three meters in front and those who are just running alone.;319;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What would you say is your greatest achievement in life?;Jacques Dubochet: I have tried all my life, I think now I can say it, to live harmoniously. Big, big, big, hard task, and to decide to make my life and I have had the chance to be able to do it relatively well as I wanted. I have given this recent time frequently for the young one and for the students and also I said it already to my students. There are two kind of fishes, the fishes going with the stream, they are the dead fish and there are the fishes going against the stream, they are the living fish. So I try to be a living fish. I was lucky and I feel that it went quite well. So my biggest achievement was that I think I could do that a bit correctly.;319;Creativity

All Nobel Laureates are asked to bring an artefact to donate to the Nobel Museum here in Stockholm, what did you bring?;"Jean-Pierre Sauvage: There was a tradition in my group, which was, at the beginning of the year, of the academic year in October, to have a long, long discussion about the research projects we were going to tackle in the coming year. And also, about the research projects which were started before and continued, to know how everything was working. I was in charge of this type of seminar and so it says here ‘research project’, I mean it’s a document in French; Présentation de projets de recherche. I’m pretty sure you can understand, and it was written on October 7, 1982. So, this is the authentic document, even written on scratch paper, you see the back of the sheet.
Jean-Pierre Sauvage: The content is simply the various projects we were going to start at that time. And in 1982, interlocking molecules, like that, were basically unknown. And I think one of the main points is that … so they appear in this document. And there’s already a strategy for making them, a strategy for making an even slightly more complex ‘catenane’. I believe this is my first written document on catenanes. October 1982, so nothing was published ‘til one year later. And this is the paper which kind of represents what happens between the project and what was achieved. It’s a publication which appeared in 1983 in Tetrahedron Letters. If I may add just one thing, it has something very special; I have published hundreds and hundreds of papers, but there are very, very few papers published in French; written in French. And this one is written in French. It says, if I translate, “a new family of molecules, metal containing catenanes”.";322;Impact of the Nobel on you
So, if I understand right, it took over one year for you to actually succeed with your experiments?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: Not for me. For the lady who was doing the work, Mrs Dietrich-Buchecker, it’s a German name because she was from Strasbourg, and she was an incredibly skilful organic chemist. She could materialize the project, convert it to a publication, to some real resource. So, I would take this opportunity to thank her, to pay homage to her qualities.;322;Research
How long had you been into research in 1982?;"Jean-Pierre Sauvage: I started my PhD thesis in 1968. A good year in France; the students’ revolution, and I was among them. And in ’68, although the surrounding was very special, I mean there were lots of things happening. I was working pretty hard, with another friend who was a PhD student with Lehn, and together we made the first ‘cage like’ molecules, cryptands, cryptates, and that was published in 1969. It was my PhD thesis work. And Jean-Marie Lehn won the Nobel Prize in 1987. To a large extent in relation to this first piece of work, but of course he expanded the field spectacularly.";322;Creativity
What brought you to science in the first place?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: In the first place, you know when you are a kid, you try to do what you like. I was good in math, mathematics was kind of my favourite topic, and that was it. And then I was interested in physics and chemistry, but I preferred math.;322;Motivation
And how come you started, you got interested in just chemistry, and maybe even photochemistry?;"Jean-Pierre Sauvage: Yes, chemistry, I always preferred chemistry versus physics
Jean-Pierre Sauvage: I don’t know, I used to do experiments. You know when I was sixteen, seventeen years old, distillation, separating chlorophylls from plants, things like that.";322;Motivation
Do you remember the moment, or the environment where you actually got the idea that led to this discovery?;"Jean-Pierre Sauvage: Yes, sure. I think you know in some of the recommendations of the Nobel Foundation for the Nobel Lecture, they suggest you to explain frankly, honestly, how you came up with the idea. And that’s what I’ll try to do. I remember very precisely. It was coming from photochemistry; you know we were photochemists.";322;Creativity
And the catenane that you mentioned, if you hold it like that and show me. What is this?;"Jean-Pierre Sauvage: It’s moving. This is the very first catenane we made, which is reported in this publication. The drawings are certainly very naïve in here; they were hand-made. And this is the first catenane we made in 1983.";322;Research
And it’s a totally new type of chemical bond, if I understand it right?;"Jean-Pierre Sauvage: It’s a new type of chemical bond, yes, Fraser Stoddart calls it the mechanical bond. And we have been more, let’s say, topology oriented, so we say that it is a topologically non-trivial molecule, or topologically non-planar molecule. This is how topologists in mathematics would refer to this molecule; non-planar. Non-planar meaning that you cannot hold any sheet of paper in a two-dimensional space without crossings; you have to have crossings. And it’s clear here you have two crossings.";322;Research
And how does this discovery take us to the chemical machines?;"Jean-Pierre Sauvage: That’s a very good point. It’s very close, in a way, because if you have things like that, you know two interlocking rings, or a ring threaded by an axis, you can relatively easyly figure out that a ring can glide; rotate within the other ring, or the ring threaded by an axis can move along the axis on which it has been threaded, from a position to another position. And this is the beginning of molecular machines.";322;Creativity
Did you have any idea of what the molecule could be used for?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: Yes, sure. We and others, again Fraser Stoddart, Ben Feringa and nowadays, many other people. I think the work of Fraser Stoddart in particular, and his group, is really spectacular. Very much in relation to molecular computing, you know storage of information, processing of information, and using molecules.;322;Research
In what timespan do you think we will have the molecular computing?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: It is too risky to say, I am not going to bet on that.;322;Future research
How many failures were there before you got the right chemical reaction to achieve this?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: The first molecule was relatively easy to make, again thanks to Christiane Dietrich-Buchecker, she was a fantastic organic chemist.;322;Creativity
Was it very, has it been very hard work for you in a laboratory?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: No, not at all. The idea was good in a way, and the synthetic strategy was good, also thanks to her, I insist on that. The work, in chemistry, the work done by the people, it’s a team work. Each time you have a team of people, working together, and everybody has a function, as a contribution, and her contribution was very important.;322;Creativity
What’s important, what different kinds of persons do you need in a team in chemistry to make these big achievements?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: I think the first characteristic is to work with people you get along well with. Preferably with friends. She was a very good friend of mine. And I think the same holds true for the students and the postdocs, you have to have very good relations. And the second point is to have people with various backgrounds also. If everybody has the same expertise in the same field, in a way, it’s not going to be very rich in terms of discussions in group meetings, at coffee, or whenever. But if the people have various backgrounds, I mean, it’s very enriching.;322;Competencies
And how would you describe yourself, your type, who are you in this team?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: I think I’m an easy to interact with person. And I like friendly relations, to me it is absolutely essential.;322;Competencies
What is needed to get this far? I mean to be rewarded the Nobel Prize?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: I think you have to be motivated. The first thing is not to think of the Nobel Prize. Not to think of any prize.;322;Impact of the Nobel on you
What’s needed more than not thinking of the prize?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: I think you have to be motivated. There are several things: you have to love science, you have to love the idea of making discoveries. And the second thing is you have to pay attention, to be very, very careful to potential research projects you may think of. Every day, every hour. And you have to take any opportunity. When you discuss with your group, when you start a new project, you may have another idea leading you to a different topic. You shouldn’t be scared. You should jump, you know. You shouldn’t ask yourself the question: “Will I be able, will I be good enough to do that?” You have to test yourself. You do it, if it fails, it fails.;322;Impact of Nobel prize on you
But you never gave up?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: No. Well, some projects, we gave up. But if you have ten projects at the same time, then if one or two projects fail, it’s not the end of the world.;322;Creativity
But you never thought of leaving science?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: No, never. No, never, this is my life.;322;Motivation
We’ve talked a lot about your research and your career, but what else in life is important for you?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: My family. I get along very well with my wife.;322;Motivation
Do you have a big garden yourself?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: No, we have a very small garden in Strasbourg, but we have a second house on the Mediterranean, in the south of France, with a nice garden. So, I do a bit of gardening.;322;Life
And do you still hope that you will construct artificial photosynthesis, so your flowers can grow even better?;"Jean-Pierre Sauvage: Yes, artificial photosynthesis is a bit ambitious, because you know the … What I hope is that we can convert light energy into chemical energy; make a fuel from light and water and CO2. Artificial photosynthesis in this way could be realistic. But photosynthesis, it’s much more than that.";322;Life
Do you have time to spend with your friends and family, or is almost all your time devoted to science?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: No, I think I have never been completely focused, and only focused on science. I had vacation with my family every year.;322;Free time
Do you think that is important, to get a lot of other influences?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: Sure. If you want to have a balanced life, you know, sure you have to.;322;Mentors (Role models)
Are you creative also on your time off from science?;Jean-Pierre Sauvage: Creative I don’t know, but I think of science, sure.;322;Creativity
How did you first get the news that you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;“I was in bed. It was 4.05 a.m. when I got a call. So, of course, I thought something bad had happened, either in Japan or in the UK, where my daughters live. When I answered the phone and got told about the Prize, I also thought it could be a hoax. Fortunately, I am good at detecting English being spoken by people of different nationalities. I soon understood that: ‘Yes, this person is speaking Swedish-English’. Then I knew it was for real.”;323;Impact of Nobel on you
It has been a while since you conducted the research on molecular machines for which you received the Nobel Prize. What are you working on now?;“I am 75 going on 76 years old. One of the projects that I am most excited about is giving the 30 to 35 very bright young people in my lab, from all over the world, pretty much free rein to do what they like. If only one or two of them come up with something out of this world, it would be a rewarding experience. The Prize has done a lot to open up these opportunities as well as funding for the project.”;323;Creativity
What was your experience like in Stockholm, both receiving the Prize and meeting the other Laureates?;“Unforgettable. I think this is a week that has been choreographed down to the last detail. Everybody was of the mind that the diversity of the experience was amazing. One of the great joys of Stockholm was spending time with my co-Laureates. There have been Laureates in the past who have been at each other’s throats and not being at all friendly. It seemed to me that we were very much one family.”;323;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What advice would you give this year’s Laureates?;“I would hesitate to give any advice because I think it is such a personal experience. I find it difficult when people ask: ‘How do you win a Nobel Prize?’ First of all, statistically it is absolutely reigned against you. And secondly, you should not pursue your profession as a scientist with this mission as your goal. You should do your research and enjoy doing it. Maybe a Nobel Prize will happen for you, but the likelihood is very small.”;323;Creativity
You are a tweeting Nobel Laureate. What made you decide to start using Twitter?;“Yes, I am totally taken over by Twitter. I feel that I must reach out to the young people who are coming into science at the moment. Twitter breaks down a lot of barriers and I become one of them. I was persuaded by my ex-graduate student Stuart Cantrill to start tweeting when I went to Stockholm. I took his advice and I am now labelled as a twitter monster! My mission is to try and get my co-Laureates and people from my generation involved. But my success rate has been very low. I have put the screw particularly on Ben Feringa to see if I can get him to start to tweet. He just looks at me and implies: ‘I am not getting into that, Fraser.'”;323;Creativity
How has your upbringing affected you?;"“It was absolutely wonderful being such a big family. Growing up on a farm was a continuous adventure, because we were a self-sustaining farm; we had cattle, pigs and chickens. My father was also growing crops and everyone in the family helped at the farm. We all had our own duty and there was always action, such as small baby calves being born. All these things that you were intensely involved in, made you ask yourself questions. How can I understand how nature operates? How is it possible to grow these beautiful sunflowers from small seeds?
My father and mother never got the opportunity to study further than elementary school. Even so, I think they easily could have gone to higher education. They were very interested in stimulating us, answering questions and debating with us. We had many books at home even in this remote area. In a farm with so many kids, uncles and aunts living in the neighborhood; we were a big family making our own adventures. That gives you a feeling for creativity and discovery. I think that is where it all started. Asking questions, being creative and imagining.”";324;Family/Home Environment
You often say that universities should be playgrounds. How can we make sure that this is the case?;"“I’m a strong believer in challenging students at all levels – to think, to discover and to go beyond the current knowledge. I think this is true for students at all levels, it starts already in kindergarten. The universities have a special role here, because academic training and science should go beyond the current horizon. I think that we shouldn’t forget that we shouldn’t train our students for today or tomorrow; we should train them for 10 to 20 years from now. Because then they will be the innovators in our society, then they will be the persons that make a difference. If we want to create an inclusive society, it’s really important that we train our students for tomorrow. That means that they have to be able to surpass the border of our current knowledge. This is what I mean with playground, that you have sufficient space to think, to discover and to be free to make mistakes. But in particular to make the next steps, be creative and not limited by what should be done. Because a lot of things happen by accident and suddenly you get a major breakthrough or new insight. Schools should encourage students to ask questions and be creative.”";324;Environment
What is it that you like so much about teaching?;"“I really enjoy the transfer of this beauty of knowledge; insights, questions, things that we don’t know, or the limitations of what we know. Also, this pleasant feeling of understanding something, even if it’s very difficult. I think that you share with your students the opportunity to transfer some knowledge, but also get a lot of things back by asking questions and discussing. Across all fields, from natural sciences to humanities, you have knowledge and insights built upon generations and decades. I think it is wonderful to be able to share that with young people that have an open mind and want to learn and are eager to know what we already know and what we don’t know.
At the universities we have to transfer a lot of knowledge and teach students the basic skills and techniques. But it’s also our duty to go beyond that – to ask them questions about what we don’t know and what improvements can we make for the future. The way we do surgery in the hospital now, it might be taken over by robots in the future, how are we going to deal with that? Or will we be able to make fuel for airplanes? These are challenging and tough questions but to share those with the students is really nice. Most of all, I think the beauty of knowledge and the excitement of insights and discoveries is fantastic.”";324;Mentors (Role models)
How important do you think it is to have great teachers in school?;"“I often ask an audience if they remember a teacher from their school period. Everyone always remembers a bad teacher, and particularly an excellent teacher. You always have one or two excellent teachers that made a difference and inspired you.
When I came to high school I didn’t know anything about chemistry and physics, as you don’t study those topics that much in elementary school. But I had a teacher that was really great. He challenged us and did a lot of experiments with us. He was such a great stimulating person that made me decide to go into chemistry because I loved the colours and smells and to the ability to do reactions and make something. You need inspirational persons that both tell you basic information but also give you this flavour of excitement. To me it made a big difference. I value great teachers a lot and I think we should invest more in our teachers; to encourage, stimulate and help them. I value this because I think that it makes a difference in our society if you have good teachers at elementary school and onwards, even if the students come from a household where education isn’t the norm.
I think every kid has a talent. Some kids become a carpenter or car mechanic. Others become teachers or painters. For teachers to stimulate that talent and encourage each kid is so crucial. You cannot expect this from all parents, because some parents never had that capability. But the teachers can recognise that, despite the fact that this kid comes from a family that has no opportunities, they have a talent.
I think the role of good teachers shouldn’t be underestimated. If you train and educate your teachers well, they will educate and stimulate your kids to reach their highest potential. Because without any doubt, every kid has a talent that we should encourage. Teachers play a crucial role there, in my opinion.”";324;Mentors (Role models)
What challenges have you found when it comes to teaching right now during COVID-19, how are you coping with that?;"“After my Nobel Prize, I held lectures at high schools to talk about the importance of teaching and about my work. But now I can’t do that anymore. I’m now in the lab where we work in shifts. That’s a bit difficult, especially when you work in chemistry, or physics or natural sciences. I think practical training is crucial. But it is tougher to do experiments because some people might have limited access, and with the large number of people in research labs it’s difficult to give all the experimental training that we want to give. That’s an issue I’m a bit worried about, because we want to train them at the right level before they finish.
The second issue is that most of the lectures are online. As a teacher, I must say that there are good courses on the internet, and it’s good that you have filmed lectures that can be reviewed. But I think the interaction in class with the students is really important. I like to discuss with my students, to be in the midst of them and to ask questions. When teaching online you sit in front of the screen, don’t see the faces of the students and receive questions in the chatbox. There is no direct contact. Last week, I was allowed to have a physical lesson with a group less than 20 people. I was really happy during those two hours. The students seemed happy too to attend a live lecture again.
For me, it was a delight, because I could talk with the students, I could ask them questions, I saw their eyes glittering and that is a great feeling. You can also improvise because you feel if they understand you or not. You can see a raised hand and a student asking something, and that is the kind of interaction that is really important for teaching. There are a lot of advantages with computers. But I’m strongly advocating that we don’t forget to also have physical contact with students, because asking questions and discussing is so important for teaching.”";324;Creativity
Do you think that education is inclusive nowadays or do you think that this is something we should improve? If so, how can we improve that?;"“That is difficult to say but we still could improve in some sense – to make it inclusive for everybody so we stimulate and challenge every kid and get the best out of each kid. I think we shouldn’t forget that a lot of children learn not only from a book or screen but also by doing practical things, especially in the natural sciences.
There is a tendency that practical research and conducting experiments in lab settings is becoming less important. I think practical learning is crucial, because a lot of kids learn by practical exercises and solving problems. That is also part of the inclusiveness for some kids. There are several aspects to this but I think schools should be a place where the talent of each student should be stimulated. Each student irrespective of background, gender and social situation should get the possibility to let their talent grow. I don’t like that schools offer better and worse education depending on where the school is located – we should have a certain minimum standard and it should be inclusive.
I grew up in a tiny village, where nobody ever went to university, certainly not from my family. My brother and I were the first to attend higher education. Without the stimulation from my teachers and parents, I would have never been there. It is so important that we give kids this opportunity. I was so lucky that my parents stimulated us a lot but it’s not the same in every family. Getting stimulation from different sides is crucial. I know, from personal experience, how difficult it can be, and how important it is that kids get that. It is the basis of their future.”";324;Life
What’s your story? What brought you to science?;"Tomas Lindahl: What brought me to science? My early education and I started out as a medical student in Stockholm after going to a gymnasium in a suburb of Stockholm. And the reason I went into medicine was our family had an influential uncle, Gunnar Lindahl. He was a director of a big hospital in Sweden and not only because of that he advised my parents that if I as a teenager had to make a decision about the rest of my life, its too early, so the best is to go in to a broad carrier where you later on can find something to do that you really like to do yourself. And they suggested the best I could do was to start studying medicine because if you are compassionate about your human beings, like providing care, that’s fine, but if you like more theoretical questions that may arise in a laboratory, that’s also quite compatible with being medic.
So you put off the big decision for a few years what you are actually going to do with your life and that’s wise, because you are not always capable to decide that in the best possible way when you are sixteen years old. You are a much better bet when you are in your mid-twenties. So that is how I got into medicine and sure enough it turned out that I started liking the theoretical part of medicine, especially biochemistry and microbiology and that is what I specialized in. I had to do some medical studies, but I wasn’t particularly good at it and I realized that I would be happier to try to do something important in the laboratory. So that was the start of it.";325;Motivation
Describe your Nobel Prize-awarded work in one minute.;Tomas Lindahl: I think many people are now aware of that in ourselves there is the carrier of genetic information and that’s the DNA. And if there are changes in the DNA, that causes mutations which are usually damaging. So the conclusion from those facts was that DNA should be very very stable, a fantastically stable chemical. We were the first ones that really started looking at could this be right? What kind of macromolecule would be so stable that it could carry all the genetic information without any risk for mistakes or errors? That’s just not possible, so we defined the errors that can occur spontaneously in DNA. If that was right, there had to be a repair mechanism to deal with these errors and we looked for such repair mechanisms and found them, these are enzymes that act on DNA by cutting away the damage bits so that the DNA can be repaired.;325;Research
What questions remain to be answered in your research?;Tomas Lindahl: Directly in my own field the repair mechanisms are very diverse and important and we only know part of them. Its not just one type of DNA repair, there are many types of DNA repair and we have gradually defined some of them and so have my colleagues, but there are still additional problems that can happen to DNA, that just haven’t been looked at yet. So it’s a very wide-open field right now and I am sure that in a couple of years or already within five years there will be new progress and new enzymes found that act on the DNA in ways that we don’t know about today.;325;Future research
What’s the toughest challenge you’ve faced? How did you overcome it?;Tomas Lindahl: What has been a tough challenge in my life? Well, besides personal controversies that I guess most people go through. In science, the tough choice was when I had successfully entered the Karolinska Institute medical school in Stockholm and was on the way of becoming a doctor and then decided to do something risky. I stopped my medical studies half-way and said that I’ll make my own carrier in an area that doesn’t really officially exist. I will work in the lab and see what happens. And then I think I would probably have come down on my feet, I could have lost a number of years, gone back as a somewhat disappointed doctor at a later stage, but that didn’t happen.;325;Creativity
What motivated you to pursue your research?;Tomas Lindahl: The main motivation was to find out how our cells work in the body. I think that is a fantastic challenge and very interesting to find out. How does life function? We are all composed of cells, but each cell – what drives it forward? And how can that happen? I don’t have any religious aspects on this at all, I think it is strictly a Darwinian evolution we are looking at, but that is fascinating, because we don’t know all the details yet. And we do need to understand all the details before we can device new medicines against many common diseases now. I am convinced that the solution to many of the major health problems in life are to be found in basic research. We just first have to find out how something works, and I would even have thought that it is fairly obvious. If you want to understand how something works, a watch or the human body, you understand how it operates, you don’t just go in and say I am going to do something applied with this, but you don’t do something applied with a watch that doesn’t show the time.;325;Motivation
Where do you do your best thinking?;Tomas Lindahl: Where I do my thinking? Anywhere. You don’t come to work and sit down in the morning at the desk and say now I am going to think. Good scientific research is a bit like an absorbing hobby. You think about it all the time. And best ideas can come to you in a totally irrelevant place, over a weekend or a vacation, just as well as when you are in the laboratory. Then you have to go back to the lab and do some experiments to show that you are right or wrong, but the basic idea can come to you anywhere.;325;Environment
Have you had a eureka moment?;Tomas Lindahl: Probably. What I am being awarded for here is the understanding that DNA is not at all as stable as people have been thinking, because if our DNA is falling apart, as it does, there has to be some kind of repair mechanism or other strategy to deal with this. I was convinced about that, that we should start looking for repair of endogenous DNA damage, just what happens to our DNA in the cell without any direct provocation, by radiation or dangerous chemicals from the outside or something like that. Something that happens all the time to our DNA, and if that is so, that means we are repairing our DNA all the time, it actually turns over at a slow rate and that is not what the textbooks are telling you at all. We were doing these experiments and found that DNA is very labeled and once you convince yourselves that its not some kind of clumsy artifact but it’s a fact, then the obvious conclusion is that the cells must have figured out how to deal with this problem and they have.;325;Creativity
Who was your most inspiring teacher?;Tomas Lindahl: An old professor at Karolinska Institute called Einar Hammarsten and his name was Einar, Einar Hammarsten, Swedish name Hammarsten. He was the teacher not only of me, but of some other very well-known Swedish scientists, Peter Reichard, who was a leading scientist at Karolinska Institute until his retirement a few years ago, he is a few years older than me. Hammarsten was inspiring because he was totally dedicated to experimental science and basic research. That was really basic science although, he was a powerful professor in a medical faculty. He realized at an early stage that you got to do basic research to figure out how things work and he would be in the lab many hours and show up over holidays and so because he was so fascinated by it all. And I found that very inspiring and so did other of his pupils, I am sure, because he was like an artist. You don’t ask a violist or a pianist Does it become boring to sit and practice every day? If you think it is boring, you should do something else.;325;Mentors (Role models)
What advice would you give yourself at 20 years old?;Tomas Lindahl: Probably, I can’t think of any better advice than the kind of carrier I’ve had, to reiterate, start studying medicine to get a broad education while you are thinking about what you are going to do. And then if you like basic science it is a fascinating area to work in. I am really pleased to have been able to do this and actually do some useful work in this field, I assume since I got an award for it now. Talent, you have to have a talent for what you want to do, I would have loved to be a great concert pianist, but I just don’t have the talent for it. But to become a scientist isn’t all that bad either.;325;Advice for young scientists
What does intelligence mean to you?;"Tomas Lindahl: It’s a difficult question because many people mean different things by intelligence. I think it’s ability to think outside the box, not to do what everybody else is doing, but come up with some new ideas. I don’t think intelligence is the same thing as some people have photographic memory and they can immediately memorize a page out of the phonebook. That’s an interesting party trick, but that is not what I mean by intelligence. If you talk to people and discuss with them and you immediately get challenged. It’s exciting to talk to such a person, that’s an intelligent person, because they are somebody who can put you on your toes and make you think about what you are saying.
I always had broad interests and I think that’s an important part to science, you should try to avoid being to specialised, especially when you are young. Take an interest in the arts, literature, anything in addition to the science you are doing. Because it helps you become more creative. If you just try to focus on one special little field and solve all the details in that little field, sometimes you will then come to end or stop, because you don’t have the background to think in a creative way what to do next. Instead of working very hard you should try to be creative and do things that you enjoy doing, reading good books for example. And I think it’s much better to read good books than watching TV. Some of my oldest friends have been literature critics and essayists and not in science.";325;Competencies
Could you describe your Nobel Prize-awarded work in simple terms?;Eric Betzig: My work and the work of my colleagues for this prize is about trying to see small things, particularly living things in cells. So, your body is composed of cells and the cells themselves are composed of molecules, and in particular proteins come together to create the life inside of cells. There is about 10,000 different kinds of proteins but they are about 100 times smaller than old microscopes can look at. The microscope we developed is a microscope to allow you to see much closer to the level of the individual molecules that make up single cells.;328;Research
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;Eric Betzig: When did I knew it was a breakthrough … My feeling is that most of the time for many awards, I think, including my work, is that there are several steps that seem like big jumps but there is not a single step. But probably the biggest small step was when my friend and I, we built the microscope that ultimately won me the prize in his living room and when we first put a sample in, it would turn on single molecules and we saw these molecules come on, I knew that the idea we had was likely going to work. So, 2006 was when that happened.;328;Creativity
What brought you to science?;Eric Betzig: The space program, because I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a kid because the Apollo program was going on then and that captured my imagination. That led me even in elementary school, by third grade I was captivated by science, particularly physics.;328;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;Eric Betzig: I am egotistical enough to consider myself as my primary role model, but there have been people, particularly system integrators of the past. I consider myself much more of an engineer than a physicist or certainly a chemist, like Jo (Joseph) Shea. He was the program manager for the Apollo program and he is the guy who brought together all the technical threads to make the command module and the lunar module and riding herds of 30,000 engineers across the country at the time. Or a guy like Elon Musk, building space axe very quickly out of nothing and Tesla. Guys like that inspire me. I would not necessarily call them role models, but it is nice to know that there are other guys out there who just don’t give up and put everything they can and all their passion into a project.;328;Mentors (Role models)
Do you see a difference between academia and industry?;Eric Betzig: It is different in some ways and the same in other ways. I worked after I got my PhD, I worked at Bell Labs a sort of industrial but really basic research place for six years and was working on technologies that ultimately lead to this prize, but I got fed up with the limitations at the time and I quit science. Then worked in my father’s machine tool company, which is a much smaller enterprise, a few hundred guys. But although, in the academic world oftentimes they looked down their noses at what happens in the industry. It has been my experience that many of the people I have met working in my father’s company were as smart, if not smarter, than many of my colleagues that I have had in academia. People are just smart in different ways and different fields and they peak at different times. Oftentimes, guys in industry are later bloomers and the sort of young kids who latch to science early, but it is all about problem solving, either endeavour, and clever people find ways to solve problems in all walks of life. My father is now retired, he is 90, but I worked with him up until, let see, until he was about 80 years old.;328;Environment
What are your future plans?;"Eric Betzig: That is a good question. The prize makes it harder leave the academic world but about every seven years I have an itch about try something new. One of my fears with the prize is that you get complacent and I always want to be pushed and scared because I feel I am most productive when I am scared about being able to provide for my family or do whatever I think, that’s when the creativity is the highest.
I feel like I have probably about two or three more years – I have actually been working on other microscopes since 2008. About four or five years ago I stopped doing the work that lead me to the prize because I was frankly bored of it. I have been working on other kinds of microscopes and answered other kinds of questions, but I think I have a couple of more years of that before I’ve said everything I have to say about microscopy. I honestly like to go work for one of the private space transportation companies if I could.";328;Future Research
What were you doing when you heard you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;"Eric Betzig: It is nice to win something like the Nobel Prize, but I feel a bit uncomfortable and, in some ways, hypocritical about accepting it, because I have always believed that accomplishments are objective, but accolades are subjective. The accomplishments are things like the idea for the thing that got me the prize, I got it right after I quit from Bell Labs and was walking my daughter around in a stroller in the neighbourhood. You can always remember those moments like the were just five minutes ago, I can remember that flash that I wasn’t even thinking about the problem, but it just pops into your head about how you can combine elements of your previous work to do something new.
The idea laid fallowed for ten years while I was in industry and then when my friend and I were visiting another lab, we found about this photoactivated protein which was the missing link. So that is another time that again will always feel like it is just a few minutes ago that you just remember “Oh my god, this is exactly what will make that idea work”. A then a year later, when we actually saw that work in the microscope, and we turned on this one light and these molecules popped on all of a sudden. We said: “We have got it; it is going to work”. Those three events that lead to this prize, those are the thing that you remember when you are dying. You won’t remember exactly what happened this week, but you will remember those actual accomplishments and when they happened.";328;Impact of Nobel on you
Could you describe your Nobel Prize-awarded work in simple terms?;Stefan Hell: I discovered that a light microscope can see sharper pictures that we believed in the 20th century, more than 100 years. This is important because light microscopy is the only way by which you can look into transparent things, important things such as cells, living cells or tissue. And the fluorescence light microscope that I invented allows you to see details that you couldn’t see before. But the basic discovery was that in the 20th century, before I made my work, people believed that you have to separate things if you looked into the microscope if you want to see them separately, if you want to see the details, by focusing the light very sharply. But what I discovered is that you can overcome this barrier by making the molecules, that we look at, distinct different. If the molecules are different you can see things separately and you can tear them apart. That was the discovery, that has led now to microscopes that are not limited by the focusing of light anymore, but you can see things at much greater detail because the separation of things is done by the molecules.;329;Research
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;"Stefan Hell: There were many points, it wasn’t just a single point. First of all, you have to get the idea that you can do something rather like light microscope because people believe that this would not be possible, and it was fully accepted in the 20th century. So, I think the first point was when I had this kind of conviction evolving in me that there must be a way to do something about this diffraction barrier, as it is called. Then I was convinced continuing and then the second big event was when I had the first concrete idea. Actually, I had when I was a post-doc in Åbo in Finland, when I realised that you can separate fluorescence molecules that are closer together than this 200 nanometer barrier but turning them on and off, playing with the brightness of them. I discovered that you can use a phenomenon, but it is called stimulated emission and this phenomenon stimulated emission does nothing but keep molecules dark, shuts the molecules off. So, I used this phenomenon of stimulated emission to shut molecules off, turn them off to see that they break one. This was the second really important event in this journey.
The third important event was when I realised that this is doable, you can really do it in practice. This phenomenon of turning off really works the way I anticipated. The fourth event was when we got the first pictures that demonstrated  – yes, you can see details in much much smaller scales because you can keep things dark and if you have two things that you cannot separate normally, because they hit at the same time with a big blob of light, you turned this one off to see this one and the you turn this one off to see that one. And that was, as it turned out, to be fundamental discovery and with that you can see now, in principal, down to the molecular scale and in practise now we are about 20 nano meters, 30 nano meters, but it is clear that the resolution will increase further and further if you perfect this state transition is a technical term of going for a brighter dark state or between two different states.";329;Creativity
What brought you to science?;"Stefan Hell: It is fascination for what I am doing. It’s also … I am very much attracted to understanding things at a fundamental level. So, if I cannot break down things to very very simple phenomenon, so I can explain it to everyone, I feel that something is missing, I have not got the point. It is deeply rooted in my heart if this is true or not, for science in general, that is questionable, but that is my attitude. When I was a student, I spent hours over a certain phenomenon, sometimes days, just to understand at the really bottom, at the very basics and before I hadn’t grasped it, I didn’t stop. It is part of my personality and I have realised that my way of thinking about the problem with diffraction barrier is definitely correct. Of course, I had many people surrounding me at that time saying that this is not going to lead anywhere. But I had thought so much about the principles and also about protect the flaws, I always thought Could there be a flaw?, Could there be a flaw?
Could there be a flaw because I didn’t go out public saying – I thinking all the times of flaws, but that is what I did. I realised that I had ruled out flaws, conceptual flaws, and the only problem remaining was technical. It is very important to understand that you have separate or distinguish conceptual flaws and technical flaws. The conceptual flaws they probably are going to stay, you cannot overcome them. But technical problems you can overcome over time with development, technology progresses, there are better detectors, better lasers and so on. That is not a flaw, that is a technical shortcoming and this you can solve. I realised that my concept doesn’t have a conceptional flaw, so conceptually it is definitely working. I could easily stand up and say I am convinced that this I going to work because the problem that you are talking about are not conceptual, they are not for the metal they are technical so there will be metal detectors, will be better and so on. Eventually it will work and that kept me going.";329;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;Stefan Hell: I didn’t have explicitly a role model some say scientist that I wanted to be like that person. I think this is also part of the success story, because you have to find your own way. It is very important that you do something from the bottom of your own heart and you find yourself in what you do and the work.  But of course, I admire scientists who had come up with fundamental and interesting ideas, with new ideas. Clearly to some extent, Einstein has always been a role model in a way of course, there is no comparison with him. He was unique. But seeing things differently, not caring about conventions, these are elements in his attitude of course that should be role models for all of us scientists and they are of course. But I also have great admiration for people like Richard Feynman. I read his book and also his biographies and when I was a student, I found him very inspiring, his attitude. He explained quantum mechanics in his own way and that was really great because it gave you some insights and that led him to do it in a new way of coming up with new things, quantum electrodynamics. These are role models in a way, but of course I have to do my own thing and I have to do it very much in my own way.;329;Mentors (Role models)
What are your future plans?;"Stefan Hell: I definitely will continue because it is kind of part of my personality, if you like, so I am still attracted hearing discoveries, seeing things from a different angle, yes, I think it is kind of, how shall I put it, a kind of commitment saying no. But after I got the prize, I felt, maybe at some point I have to think about something else, open text books again and check out what else is there that people believe and has been repeated many times, many times, many times and everyone believes it. Maybe it is not the end of it or maybe something important has been missed out. I think it is very interesting to see how science works, this in retrospect, I didn’t expect it honestly. A lot of it is perception, I couldn’t have imagined that, so sometimes people and science perceive things in a wrong way and just taking a different angle and explaining things or sorting out things from a different angle – all of a sudden can open new aspects that were totally unanticipated and this is so important.
I think it is important to go back again and say okay now we have this phenomenon, we have this thing, but we have to take a different angle, maybe a different way of looking at it. Still, it has to be of valued one, no doubt, but taking a different angle is so important. I think, breaking the diffraction barrier is a fantastic example because, as I said, the the problem was that people saw, the scientists saw, you have to distinguish features, so to speak, by the focusing of light, the phenomenon of focusing of light and because they cannot focus light any better than a certain diameter you cannot do it. The breaking of the diffraction barrier happened because, I would back off and say oh, what do we have here, do we have to separate by the focusing of light or can we separate by the molecular states? Once we separated the molecular states, the focusing of light doesn’t matter or hardly matters. It is so important to understand, to just taking a different angle all of a sudden, make things look totally differently.";329;Future Research
Can you explain your work in easy-to-understand terms.;The work that I did to receive the Nobel Prize, involved detecting single molecules, individual molecules. What you want to think about, is that a single molecule is incredibly tiny, just a few nanometers in size and those single molecules are now being used as light sources, which are used to make an image of a structure or an object inside a bacterium or a cell at extremely high resolution. Because they are so small, they can go beyond the diffraction limit of light, it is ultimate sort of limit, that has, until now, made microscopes be very fuzzy in pictures that they take.;330;Meaning(Values) of Work
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;We realized that our work was going to be very important, when we started seeing amazing surprises from these individual molecules. You might think that “Oh, I look at an individual molecule at low temperatures and maybe they are all the same and so there is nothing really interesting”, but the molecules were behaving differently. One molecule would jump from one colour to another or wave links to another or they would turn on and off and blink in interesting ways. And it is because of the molecules do this, that they have an individual behaviour that we were very excited. Going beyond this previous limit of not being able to see single molecules, opened up a whole new arena of new science, new chemistry and new applications – such as the super resolution microscopy.;330;Creativity
What brought you to science?;When I was growing up, I became very interested in science, partly because of the influence of my parents who were encouraging me in science and mathematics in every way. I spent time taking apart old television sets, I learned how to do experiments in chemistry in the backyard. In terms of the sort of the stimulus from my parents and my father’s ability to repair things, I grew to love working and fixing things and figuring out how they work. So, those directed me towards science and the really important thing to think about is, how does this really work, how does everything in our world and nature, how does it behave and that’s kind of the sort of the passion for understanding. That really makes science exciting for me.;330;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;You know, when I think about role models, I can imagine many answers to that question. There is a lot of people that have been influenced me, my mentors in college and graduate school, but if I go back and think about the scientist that inspired me, I would have to say someone like Michael Faraday, who spent a great deal of time influencing multiple fields of science. That is contributing to chemistry and contributing to physics and contributing to materials and so forth and so that’s kind of guided me a lot, that idea of learning different areas of science and putting them together to push back some boundaries. It is kind of something that has been exciting me all along.;330;Mentors (Role models)
What were you doing when you heard you had been awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences?;When that day occurred, I was at a conference in Brazil and I was getting ready go to the talks for this particular meeting on fundamentals of light matter interactions. So, what a wonderful conference to attend. I was not contacted directly by the Nobel Foundation because it was too difficult to reach me, so I received a phone call from my wife and I had just gotten dressed for the meeting but then I had to change clothes quickly to get ready for the interviews and so forth that occurred right after, so I was very surprised, excited and thrilled to hear about the prize.;330;The impact of nobel on you
Could you explain your Nobel Prize awarded work for young students?;"Martin Karplus: Actually, I have a niece who is 13 years old who is with us here, and we talked a little about it. It turns out at least in the US children that age know a great deal about biology, they know what proteins are, they know what mitochondria are, so I am not sure it’s as difficult to explain as it seems to be implied by the question How do you explain it to a 13 year old? But one of the best things is to take an example of what we were able to do. One of the things that make cells work is that they have little transport systems, they have molecules that have basically two feet, and they walk along reels which are called microtubules and they transport things from one end of the cell to another.
In fact, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was given for studying the vesicles, the things that these little engines carry from one part to another, but they just looked at the top part here and the vesicles that are carried. We figured out how a couple of molecules which are basically two globular domains like this, that are connected by a coiled-coil can actually walk and they walk the way we walk, in the sense that you put the left foot forward and the right foot forward, left foot forward and the right foot forward. That is one example of how, although people had studied them experimentally and had static pictures of what they looked like, they couldn’t figure out how they moved their feet, they sort of throw their feet forward and it’s that what is one application of the message that we developed, that it can teach us how molecular motors, as these are called, these are called kinesins, how they work.";331;Research
What brought you to science?;"Martin Karplus: I have always enjoyed looking around, looking in nature, seeing things that are around me. When I was young, about nine years old or so, my brother received a chemistry set and so of course I also wanted a chemistry set, but my parents felt that having two chemistry sets in the family, making smells and exploding things was a little too much. So my parents gave me a microscope and what I did was to take sort of the run off on the sidewalk and such and I discovered, looking through the microscope, these little animals, they are called rotifers. They have little discs on the front of them and these discs rotate, and they sort of swim through the water. When I saw that I told my brother and then my father and then I had various of my school friends come and everybody thought that this was really great. That was sort of the beginning of my idea of going into science.
Actually, my family, we come from Austria, and they had left when Austria was taken over by the Germans. My family had always had a physician in there, so that each generation had been a physician because physicians were one of the things that you were allowed to be in Austria even though we were Jewish and since nobody else was interested in being a physician I somehow was designated and when I was little I used to go around and bandage chairs and such. But it was sort of, it wasn’t clear that I wasn’t going to go to med school and go into science even though I was very interested in understanding things and it was really only finally when I started college and got sort of more ideas, but I had a very good chemistry teacher and realized that if you wanted to understand biology you had to learn chemistry and physics and at that point is really when I gave up the idea of medical school and become a scientist.";331;Motivation
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Nobel Prize?;Martin Karplus: Many people have asked me what was happening when we got the call, actually it was at 5 o’clock in the morning so we were asleep. The telephone is on my wife’s side of the bed so she picked it up and said: “Some call, maybe it’s for you, it wasn’t quite clear” and gave it to me and my first reaction was that when you get calls at 05.30 in the morning it’s usually bad news, maybe that our son was sick or our daughter in Israel, we hear that something has happened there. But little by little I discovered what it actually was, that it was a phone call from Sweden announcing the Nobel Prize and I was, you know, very pleased by that. To be quite honest many people have said that I should have had the Nobel Prize maybe 30 years ago, so actually for a while, until fairly recently, I used to sort of watch at the right time, usually whenever we spent half of our time in Europe and half of our time in the US. If you are in Europe of course the Nobel Prize is announced at a more decent time, you know around 11.30 or so and I used to watch, but the last few years I decided, well, I have sort of given up and so it was a pleasant surprise.;331;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What has been the most significant breakthrough in your career?;Martin Karplus: My early work was a breakthrough which is probably as famous as this, this was nuclear magnetic resonance and there is an equation named after me, it’s called the Karplus equation. So my life has been a combination of breakthroughs about every five years or so and maybe this will come up later again. I try to do something new and so I have had breakthroughs at various times during my life. And what was selected for the Nobel Prize is pretty arbitrary, so it’s a little hard to say what was the breakthrough. What they cite actually is something that I personally don’t think with a breakthrough but it’s sort of a little part of the important aspect of what I, and now many thousands of people who use the same methods, have done.;331;Creativity
How do you stay creative?;Martin Karplus: They had the idea that I should stay in a given university only five years and I stayed … I mean after being in Europe I went to Illinois and was there for five years and I went to Columbia and was there for five years, then I was at Harvard for five years, then I actually moved to Paris. My feeling was that it was very good to get a new environment, to start new problems, completely different problems like the first five years at the University of Illinois. I mentioned that I developed this equation and I was focused on nuclear magnetic resonance which was a new technique in chemistry, and I felt that the theoretical approaches could give insights that people didn’t have because it wasn’t sort of worked out. Then when I went to Columbia I started working on chemical reactions and I when I went to Harvard I started working on biological systems and I think that, as having a new environment and starting something new makes it most likely or more likely, maybe a fair answer, that you will really discover something. I would get invited to go to meetings that discuss what I had sort of stopped doing, and the people are doing interesting things, but for me, I had the feeling that yes, I know what is going on, and it doesn’t have the same excitement. Of course, being a professor having students you can still be working in the old area so you don’t suddenly stop publishing and people wonder what is going on while you are developing ideas as to what they are doing is new. I think it’s right if you want to continue to be creative you have to go into something that you don’t understand, otherwise, at least for me, it isn’t very exciting.;331;Creativity
Can you tell us about your passions?;Martin Karplus: In addition to being a scientist I have two other passions, one is photography and actually I had a exhibit of my photographs in Paris and they have nothing to do at all with the science, some of them were taken in Norway and the exhibit is in the 1950s and 60s. I traveled a lot and took Kodachrome pictures and for a while Emily took pictures of my family and thinking of maybe making up an exhibit from those photographs now that I am sort of better known as a photographer. The other thing is that when we do these calculations, we don’t really do any chemistry, the chemistry that I do do is actually cooking. For many years I used to work in a famous restaurant in France in such for two or three weeks every summer and work in the kitchen and replace the people who were taking their day off. That was the real chemistry that I lik to do and still at home now I do the cooking and my wife does the dishwashing and such. So, I think it is nice if being a scientist when you work, you really work full time. I think that’s one of the things you have realize that you have to work really very hard. You can be smart, but that’s not enough. But for me the very important part is okay. I work very hard when I am doing science, but then I do other things and I do them as well and I think that is a good way of living. It’s also better obviously for your family if you can sort of divide your time a little and we have a chalet in the Haute Savoie where we love to go walking and such. I think that’s … for me at least … somebody has written that actually it’s in the preface of a photobook that every scientist has a secret garden and that’s my secret garden.;331;Motivation
Could you explain your Nobel Prize awarded work for young students?;Michael Levitt: Firstly we have been helped very much by the Nobel Committee because they really helped to define a certain part of work and I would say that the work that we did was develop models for the big molecules in chemistry and biology that would enable one to do calculations on these models. One needs to remember that computers were really really slow back then, something like a hundred million times slower than today and basically the key thing was to simplify things, and as Einstein once said something , at least it’s attributed to Einstein, although the wikiquote said it wasn’t really him, and that was that you should make everything as simple as you can but no simpler. So we had to make things as simple as we could so that the computer could do the calculation and not so simple that the results would be meaningless. We were lucky, I think we got the right level of simplicity. We were then able to put them in to the computer and do calculations on large molecules simulations. It’s a bit like simulating the weather, which I guess in Sweden doesn’t work very well, but in some countries like California it really works well, because tomorrow will be like today will be like yesterday and so on. But in calculations you can do the same thing for biological molecules and then you can sort of calculate the date in between experiments so it becomes a tool that can be used with experiments and I think there is going to be many things in the future where computers are going to be so important.;332;Research
What brought you to science?;Michael Levitt: One answer is that when I was fifteen, I used to like to play pool, snooker, and one night I came back really late and my mother was really upset and worried, I was in South Africa and it wasn’t that safe. She said: “If you have so much time to go and play with your friends you should work harder at school”. She made me skip two years of school and go to university two years earlier, but I had an uncle and an aunt who were scientists in England and it was also an television programme on the television in England in 1964 and it was given by a very famous British Nobel Laureate, John Kendrew, who got the Nobel Prize in -62. This was a television programme called The thread of life and it really had a big influence. I remember in South Africa there would be no televisions, for me television was really a big deal and the television I had was probably a really expensive black and white television about this big, in fact it was black and yellow. On the BBC they had this programme The thread of life as well as the Winter Olympics in -64 and I think I liked The thread of life more, so that’s what made me into that area. It was a lot of different kind of lucky things happening. I am very pleased, even without the Nobel Prize I am very pleased to be a scientist, it’s a great carrier.;332;Motivation
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Nobel Prize?;Michael Levitt: I was very surprised, somewhat very tired because I got to sleep one hour before, so I was just getting into sleep. I think initially with feeling of chock, disbelief, but then the committee was very clever, they ask you questions that only they would know, people said to me: “You had to send that review four years ago and you never did it, where is it?” Somebody else said “Remember how we got drunk in Italy in the summertime” and the other person said: “When you go to the archipelago you’d better come with me, don’t go by yourself”, so this made me realise … I actually talked to the Chairman of the committee today and he said somebody last year had been called the night before on a joke call and when they called him he was really upset so they decided from now on they would have this verification scheme.  Very quickly, it’s a real chock, I was like, I describe it as five double espressos maybe it was seven, but it was really an adrenalin burst, that’s amazing, kind of a nice drug.;332;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Have you had a eureka moment?;Michael Levitt: I think when we did the work, and this was work that was done, I was between the ages of 20 and 25, I was very young. I think we thought the work was exciting, but I think a scientist always thinks their work is exciting, and there is a big difference. Even if you think your work is exciting and having an impact, to get a Nobel Prize it’s got to be a certain area and I think I have always worked in many different areas. I think it was quite hard for them to find one area that went right back to the beginning so I was certainly surprised.  I think that in science you hardly ever have a eureka moment, you have lots of little eureka moments, like I have just found an error in a programme or where did I leave my keys or whatever, but I think that it’s much more. Science is a mixture of ideas and lots of hard work and being very persistent. I think you have to not give up, you have to believe in yourself, you have to realize that if it’s a new idea, people are not going to like it and if people like it then it’s not a good idea.;332;Creativity
Could you please explain your Nobel Prize awarded work for 13-14 year olds?;"Arieh Warshel: To explain to 13-14 year olds … I essentially try to give my lecture to my granddaughter who is maybe 14 and then I found out that I have to change a lot. There are several things to explain. First of all the idea which is very simple to any age that if you have a very very complex system, the best is to focus on the main part and not to, like if it is a picture, not to look on all the parts in the same details. For example in my lecture we try to, I am still working on it, but we have a cart in the forest and we try to focus on the cart and to have the forest with much less pixels, so this is the general idea of what one call multiscaling. When it comes to biology you have a complex protein and you want to understand how it works.
First of all you have to assume that you could deal with it, not to listen to people who say that it is too complex. Then you say: I want to understand how it works, like if you have a watch and the watch is already there and you want to understand how it works. You are first to think about it, which I think that a 13 year old boy or girl could understand, then you look on parts of it and try to figure out how they work when all the rest is not moving and then you try, after you understand this, to let the rest of it move and then you get a picture how it works. So it’s basically understanding how biological molecule works and to explain more you have to take given system like proteins that chop molecules and you want to understand why it works so fast. The main point is that it is very hard to do it without a computer so young people understand what is computer, but this is not to send text message but to actually model how things are working and when you model it you kind of understand it, it’s like simulator for flight training so you are going inside the protein and see how it works.";333;Research
What brought you to science?;Arieh Warshel: I grew up in kibbutz and even going to university was considered quite different, because in the kibbutz at that time they want you to – and I don’t blame them – they want you first to return your share to work in the kibbutz so they did not encourage you to do what is called matriculation or anything else and I felt at some stage that I want to go to university, but it was mainly for the accomplishment without any clear pattern of what it would be. I read books, I read about Marie Curie and other, but there was no connection so after the army when I was accepted to the Technion I met a friend in the Technion yard and asked him what direction I should take and he says that I have a good eyesight and therefore I should go to chemistry. For me it was really studying and getting the highest grades, but I felt that eventually I would figure out which direction to go, so its not that I dreamt of solving some problems.;333;Motivation
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Nobel Prize?;Arieh Warshel: I was of course sleeping, It was two o’clock and my wife pick the phone and I said “It is too early, so it must be something else”, because I felt that the news conference should be at 12 and this was ten o’clock. Then I picked up the phone and I was very happy to hear the Swedish accent and then I heard in the background people that I know so I was very happy, though it takes very long time to internalize this so I didn’t to anything. I think that my wife did something like [waving with his arms[, but for me it took a while.;333;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Who is your role model, and why?;Arieh Warshel: The question about having a role model, so again I just say it’s not going from young age, but there are a few people that I admire in science, very few and one of them is Ludwig Boltzmann that I hold in very high regards, regardless of the fact that he commited suicide at the end. He is the guy who kind of invented statistical mechanics, he is the guy who figureed out what is entropy while everybody else got it from the work of heat engines. He figured out how it works on molecular level and he had a lot of detract also, who claims that he is wrong. He did not necessarily influence his career, I don’t know if he got Nobel or not, but he was a very important professor and a very original thinker so I think I put him at the highest. He is in some respect a role model, like many times when I give seminars and I try to explain how enzyme work and how they do not work, I put his photo as example of at which direction you have to look. He is buried in Trieste and essentially I heard that is good. When I teach chemistry, I force the students to draw his picture for one point, so I have a role model.;333;Mentors (Role models)
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;Arieh Warshel: One time was when the work on protein folding. The question is how protein could fold to one structure instead of many structures. When this worked, it was something that was declared as a major problem, though to me it was not such a big deal or puzzle, but it was clearly something impressive. The other part which I consider more important, like understanding how enzymes works, figuring out how to model enzymes. I felt this is breakthrough when it was done, but it was not necessarily shared by the referees or the community, so there is this gap between me thinking that’s something important to asking whether it will make impression. I had quite many problems that I was extremely happy to solve, then of course unhappy from the response of the referees, but overall there were several major accomplishments that I felt this is nice.;333;Creativity
How do you find being a Nobel Laureate?;Arieh Warshel: Obviously, I am very happy. I was told by other Laureates that this should be the nicest week in my life, at present it does not look like this because of too much stress from interviews, not yours. I am sure that it happens to others, but it must eventually well out and you’re left only with the nice memories, so I am really looking forward for the rest of the week. I have many friends here so we will be very happy to see them.;333;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I know you have been looking forward to this. This trip, this prize – how has it been so far?;Robert Lefkowitz: Very very hectic. In a way we almost don’t get a chance to look forward to it too much, because we are so busy with interviews and preparations and just doing things for the press etcetera. Now finally we are here and it’s happening and it is just remarkable.;334;Impact of Nobel on you
You’re known to be a person that makes other people glow – a great mentor – how do you manage? What’s your recipe?;Robert Lefkowitz: This is a very good question. I think that for most things of this nature, there probably isn’t a recipe. I try to teach my fellows that we are all born with certain gifts and with certain deficiencies. You have to play … The key to be successful I think is to emphasize your strengths and try to stay away from your deficiencies. One of my gifts, I guess, is that I have a great level of enthusiasm for what I am doing and that seems to be infectious. If I am enthusiastic about something everybody around me seems to get enthusiastic about it. I once looked up the derevation of the word enthusiasm. It comes from the Greek and apparently literal derevation means “a God within” this enthusiasm. I think enthusiasm is just something bubbling up from inside you and I think it’s a wonderful thing to bring to your work, because if you bring that kind of enthusiasm to your work, it feels like play.;334;Mentors (Role models)
You are a quite focused person, very dedicated. Were you dedicated to your piano playing?;Robert Lefkowitz: No, I was terrible at the piano. My mother insisted that I’d take piano lessons and I hated … The low point of my week – I had weekly lessons – the low point of my week was when I would walk into the studio and have to perform for my teacher and he would say, “You’re not doing very well” and I’d say, “I know” and he’d say, “Did you miss any days this week, of practice?” – I was supposed to practice an hour a day – and I’d say, “Well, I guess I did” and he’d say, “How many did you miss?” and I would have to say, “Well, six”, so not very much practice.;334;Creativity
Have you started a club, like secret one with a secret code?;Robert Lefkowitz: Not really a secret club, but it is remarkable. There was a little essay published in a very prominent journal called Science just last week written by two of my closest friends and colleagues Mike Brown and Joe Goldstein from Dallas Southwestern university, he is a prior laureate. They were sitting behind me – which I had no idea that would be the case – they were directly behind me on the stage, there was a row of former laureates. It turned out that they wrote an essay, the impetus to which was my being awarded the Nobel Prize. The theme of the essay was that there were nine of us now – who had won the Nobel Prize – who trained at the National Institute of Health, physician scientists in an eight-year period between the mid–1960s and the early 1970s. It’s a remarkable record.;334;Environment
You are here for Nobel Week, the culmination of two months of fairly frenzied activity I imagine since the calls came. How have those last two months been? How have you found it?;Brian Kobilka: A bit overwhelming. It would have been a busy two months had this not happened, but it has been an extraordinarily busy time.;335;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I suppose not. And you had the added ownness of being the first Nobel Laureate from Duke University?;Robert J. Lefkowitz: Yes, indeed. This caused quite a bit of ruckus, that it was the first, and they likened it to when we won our first NCAA basketball championship under the very famous coach K, coach Krzyzewski. I think one of the most exciting things that happened to me, during this period of time was that I was honoured at Cameron Indoor Stadium, which is the basketball stadium, by coach K and the basketball team that presented me with a jersey with a number one on it and my name. Which seemed to impress my children perhaps even a bit more than the Nobel Prize itself.;335;Impact of the Nobel on you
So why did you choose that field for your own research when you started research?;Robert J. Lefkowitz: I had been at the NIH for a fellowship in 1968 to 1970 and this was the golden age of second messenger signalling. Earl Sutherland had recently won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of cyclic AMP which is a molecule generated on the inner surface of the cell membrane when what we now know GPCRs are activated. My mentors there Jesse Roth and Ira Pastan thought it might be possible to label the receptors because they felt they existed. They were what would be called molecular endocrinologists and they thought it would be possible to label them with radioactively labelled materials. I was assigned the project of trying to label a receptor for ACTH, Adrenocorticotropic hormone, which works through a G-protein couple receptor and I spent my two years there radioactively labelling ACTH and showing that I could bind it to some sites on the plasma membrane of a tumour which was responsive to ACTH, so it was an ACTH responsive cancer that I passed in nude mice. We were successful in doing that. The work did not really go any further than just developing these radioligands, but really, the idea caught fire in my imagination!;335;Motivation
But you started out with the intention of becoming a medical doctor? And then you transitioned to research. I was going to ask you both, what sort of flipped you away from medicine onto the bench?;Brian Kobilka: I think I had the intention of, at the time I was in training in internal medicine in St Louis, of being an academic physician. Which meant that I would continue seeing patients and I would find some line of research. At the time I was really very interested in intensive care medicine and I believe there were not intensive care medicine fellowships at the time. It was either cardiology or pneumology and so I decided to go into cardiology. I learned that … I was also really interested in research, although I cannot at the time say I was really interested in adrenergic receptors. I was interested in the concept of using adrenaline in other compounds like that in intensive care unit. And Duke hade a fantastic research program for cardiology fellows. You could go to Duke, you could spend at least a year and a half doing research and you could do it up front, which was really attractive to me after spending three years taking care of patients and really wanting to try out research. I do not know how many places I applied to, but I was very happy to be accepted into Duke and very happy that Bob chose to let me in his lab.;335;Motivation
We will come to your lab environment soon. When was the last time you saw a patient?;Brian Kobilka: Actually, I continued to see patients while I was a fellow, primarily moonlighting and weekends, and I am not sure, but I think I can say this now since the statute of limitations is up, but when I moved to Stanford my wife Tong Sun started medical school, so our children were old enough to go to school. She started in medical school in Stanford, so we had a very large mortgage in tuition, and I continued to moonlight for quite a few years in emergency rooms.;335;Life
Maybe you are still moonlighting, maybe we should not talk about this … How about you, Bob, you had wanted to be a doctor?;"Robert J. Lefkowitz: I very much wanted to be a physician, and had harboured that goal, I would say from the time I was eight or ten years old. Like Brian, I learned last week, a very similar experience, I was inspired by my family physician, who made house calls, and I decided that is it, that’s what I want to do, and I thought about nothing else in terms of a goal, right through grade school, high school and college. I would say that Brian, for what I know, who actually showed an interest in research earlier than I, because as I understand Brian had a mentor experience in college, and I think even won an award for his research thesis at Yale, if I am not mistaken. I had absolutely no research experience until I went to the NIH in 1968. In fact, in medical school we had a couple of opportunities to do two month’s electives in research – I never took one – I had no interest in it, I wanted only the clinical electives, so called sub-internships.
But in the late 60s, the Vietnam war was raging and many of us were opposed to that war on multiple grounds, there was a drift, physicians were drifted. You had to go in after two years of training which many of us did not want to do, so there were few options, they were very competitive to get, that would get you out of going to Vietnam. One was to join the United States public health service as a commissioned officer and be assigned to the NIH for two years. Very very competitive to get such positions, but I had a strong academic record, and I was able to get that, and it seemed like a good thing to do, because like Brian, I pictured myself someday as an academic physician and I vaguely had it in my head that academic physicians did some research. So, I figured, well, I get my research papers and I go. And that is where I got started in research.
Now there is a very interesting and timely piece in, I guess, last week’s issue of Science, by Mike Brown and Joe Goldstein, in which they review basically the history of that year, and remarkably it turns out between 1964 and 1972, I think is the slice they took, I became the ninth Nobel Laureate to have trained. I actually went through the list. Six of us came between 1967-70 and when I say came, I do not mean there were a hundred of us each year – in a year there might have been eight or ten or twelve – so it was a remarkably high success rate.";335;Creativity
When did you give up on patients?;Robert J. Lefkowitz: I actually made teaching rounds for 30 years at Duke. I would do one rotation a year, six weeks, from age 30 to age 60, at my 60th birthday, for a variety of reasons, I hang up my stethoscope.;335;Environment
At Duke, you pursued this difficult task of purifying the β-adrenergic receptor, it took 15 years to purify and clone, that is quite an undertaking. Did you have, as you were on that path, the goal of that purification so that you were always looking that far ahead?;Robert J. Lefkowitz: Definitely. That was a goal for many, many years. Something interesting that … at least it is my view of things now, and maybe it is revisionist history, but when I look back on that period, my sense is that it almost never occurred to me we would fail. I always believed we would be successful. When I look back on it now, it was kind of crazy, but that is my sense of it now. I always assumed it would all work, I did not know when or how long it would take, but sooner or later we would get there. It never occurred to me that maybe it would not work at all and it would be a total dead end.;335;Creativity
Let’s talk about the lab a bit because you have had an immensely productive lab, both in the sense of papers and discoveries, but also in the sense of people. You have had more than 200 people? You must have got a research environment going which people want to join. What was the secret of it?;"Robert J. Lefkowitz: That’s a very good question. I think there probably are a number of elements. One of course is the old business of success breeds success, if a program is successful then people want to come because there is high visibility research going on. As to why we were so successful, I mean there is a lot of mystical stuff, like I’m a great judge of talent, that’s how Brian came to my laboratory. I say that and we both laugh because when he came to interview as I recall, I was out of town.
Brian Kobilka: Right there, yes.
Robert J. Lefkowitz: I wasn’t there, and I think he even made a second visit, and I was also not there. But in any case, as I wasn’t there, so obviously I’m a good judge of talent, and I took him anyway, sight unseen. I think one of the things about working in a lab is to have good esprit de corps, which can’t be 100%, there is always going to be some odd balls or some oil and water mixtures of people just doesn’t get along, but I think in general we had good chemistry of people in the laboratory. I think I always brought to the endeavor a real sense of enthusiasm for what we are doing. Enthusiasm is something that you can’t fake, you can’t fool people. I remember at my 60th birthday party that Brian was at and many of the fellows came to, they were giving various talks about what they remembered. I remember one postdoc from that era, a wonderful guy named Rick Serione, who is now a professor of … has a name chair, in chemistry actually, at Cornell, was saying that one of the things that kept him going is that he always sensed from me that his project, which was a reconstitution of the receptor after it was purified, was the most important project in the lab, and he liked that, until one day he talked to some other guy and he said: No, I felt my project was the most important. It turned out that everybody thought their project was the most, and I guess somehow I transmitted that, because probably I believed it, including Brian’s, which really was the most important project in the lab.";335;Competencies
With Bob sitting here maybe it is not the right place to ask you, or maybe it is the right place, does that rhyme with your experiences of Bob’s lab?;"Brian Kobilka: I would say yes. He was always very enthusiastic and encouraging, and you felt that you could try anything. I don’t actually remember there being any kind of limit on even what we could spend to try something that was completely sometimes crazy.
Robert J. Lefkowitz: I think one of the things I taught Brian was how to go into debt in the laboratory, and he has been very god at that, the reason he is I am sure he could tell you about. The folks in the lab probably didn’t even know it, bur on several occasions when things really got hot, and we were making progress on a project, I would just overspend, I would just not care about the budget, we would just do what we needed to do. I was called on the carpet on several occasions, both by the chairman in medicine, named Jim Weingarten, and also by the head of the Howard Hughes medical institute. The administrator of the Hughes institute, a guy named Kenny Wright, he was a good old Southern boy, and I remember on two occasions they sent him down specifically, as he put it, to ‘slap me on the wrist and take me up behind the woodshed’ because I had totally overspent my budget and he was there to sort of arrange things in. On the other hand, we were doing good work and he was kind to give me a wink, but he brought the message anyway.";335;Creativity
When you pick people to join your lab, what do you look for? People you can get on with foremost?;"Brian Kobilka: It’s very important that not only I get along with them, that they get along with other people in the lab, it’s really important to have chemistry in the lab. I would say that the lab has been most successful when people work together on again, very challenging projects, sharing ideas, sharing reagents, really take teaming on projects – I think that’s really key to having a productive and enjoyable experience.
Robert J. Lefkowitz: I think something that is very important both to Brian and myself is the mentoring of the young people. People often ask me, because I have been successful in training so many people, ‘What are the keys to mentorship?’ It’s like everything else, there’s not one right way to do it, just like there’s not one right way to do science. I think many people consider both Brian and myself for good mentors but our personalities couldn’t be more different, so obviously we can’t possibly mentor people in the same way, and yet we both seem to wind up doing a fairly good job of it. I think a lot of this is just a matter of are you willing to invest yourself in people and really care about them and care about their careers and success. And challenge them! To put things in front of them which they really have to reach to get to. If you can give somebody the experience of working right at their potential, really doing something which tests them and extends their limits and let them feel what it is like to succeed at that level – then you have done it, because then they know what it feels like, they know what they are capable of and they are willing to challenge themselves in the future.";335;Competencies
You have to know them pretty well to know what to challenge them with?;Robert J. Lefkowitz: Exactly. For me personally getting to know people, getting in their head, because you challenge different people in different ways, it takes different kinds of things. The whole issue of how much to direct people, it’s a delicate balance, you can direct them too much, they may be successful in the short term, but they never gain the confidence that they can really do it by themselves. Or you can direct them too little, and they just drift and become unfocused etc. So the question is to provide enough direction but not too much direction. Of course, there’s nobody who can tell you what that is, you just have to figure that out individually.;335;Creativity
If we just return to the lab. You came into the lab and were involved in other stages of this β–adrenergic purification and cloning experiment where the structure of the β–adrenergic receptor was revealed. That acted in a phrase that seems very appropriate, as the Rosetta stone unleashing lots of other G-protein coupled receptor structures and revealing that there was this super family. I have often heard people say that in retrospect of course there was a super family, it was obvious, but was it obvious as you went into it?;"Robert J. Lefkowitz: Not in the least. When we were cloning, we had first been successful in getting what we knew to be valid clones for the receptor. It’s not like today, it’s amazing to think back. How many nucleotides were there in the open reading frame … a couple of thousand?
Brian Kobilka: Yes, 1,500.
Robert J. Lefkowitz: And how long did it take between us and Merck to sequence that piece of DNA?
Brian Kobilka: I don’t remember.
Robert J. Lefkowitz: That wasn’t a day or two, was it?
Brian Kobilka: No, wasn’t a day or two.
Robert J. Lefkowitz: It was probably a matter of weeks.
Brian Kobilka: Probably between 100 and 200 base pairs.
Robert J. Lefkowitz: While we were sequencing it, word began to get around on campus, I don’t know if you know this story… Word got around the campus: we had it. OK. And I don’t remember who, but somebody … We had part of the sequence, I don’t know how many base pairs, and we knew we had the right thing because we already could see some of the five peptides that we knew were in there from our sequencing of pure protein. And a colleague said: ‘What does it look like?’ And I remember distinctly saying to him ‘It doesn’t look like anything, why should it look like anything, this is the first one’. So that shows you the extent to which we were not expecting what we eventually found which was the homology with rhodopsin. This even now, the functional analogies between rhodopsin and transducin and the /- – -/ with the βreceptor, the G protein, those functional analogies were clear, and I think by then it was probably clear that transducin and Gs were members of a family. Nonetheless, nobody was expecting the βreceptor and rhodopsin to look alike, it was only later, after the full sequence emerged that these homologies became clear. But in the early going I thought we were describing the very first … they were so generous.";335;Creativity
Was it with great pleasure that you realized that you were suddenly opening up this super family, or was it in fact a sense of oh, other people knew this already, other people could have tweaked this?;Robert J. Lefkowitz: Shortly after we reported our clone, about four months later, Elliott Ross, Dallas, reported on another, the β1–adrenergic receptor, from a turkey, and it looked very similar. Then /- – -/ Anouma, a little bit later, reported on two muscarinic receptors. Very quickly, within a year or less, we had those, and then we, Brian, cloned the α2–adrenergic receptor again, within about a year based on protein sequence that we had. Very quickly it was filling out that there was this family. I think in the moment we cloned the β2 I think it was a Heureka moment, but I don’t think any of us … and we /- – -/ right enough for a paper maybe they are all going to look like this, but I don’t think any of us really conceived just how large and diverse this family was going to be. And certainly of course the olfactory receptors which came four, five years later doubled the number of receptors right on the spot. It’s like all discoveries – many discoveries – you don’t fully appreciate the significance in the moment, it becomes clearer and clearer and clearer over the years.;335;Family/Home Environment
"Everybody needs a sounding board; you obviously have an appetite for these high-pressure situations. We don’t have very long left, but I would like to just touch very briefly on the medical aspects. As I said in the beginning, about 50% of medicines acts through GCPRs, but there are a lot of off target effects and side effects. Would you like to say how the work that you do has impacted, or will impact, the development in medicines?";"Robert J. Lefkowitz: I think that in particular the recent work that both Brian and I have been doing – totally different kinds of work – each in their own way has implications for potentially developing more specific medications, by which we mean medications which have less side effects. If you look back over the history of pharmacology at least during the 40 years that I have been involved, there have been several advances that have helped us to … by “us” I mean others, I mean the drug /- – -/, the tailor GPCR targeted drugs with less side effects. The first development was the elucidation of previously unknown receptor sub-types. The cloning revolution changed everything. When I started my career I think there were three adrenergic receptors and then early on, I guess around the time in the early med-seventies a fourth was discovered. By the time we got done with our cloning we had eight and then a ninth was added. There was one dopamine receptor, it went to five; there was one muscarinic, it went to five; there were one or two or three or – I forget – tone receptors that went to 15. With the advent of these greater and greater receptor subtype you could get more and more specific actions because you didn’t have to get the off-target effects from a different subtype. But now I think there may be even other ways in which we can get greater specificity.
One of the things I’ve worked on during the past decade has been the fact that in addition to signaling to the inside of cells through G-proteins the receptors can also signal through a different molecule called β-arrestin. This is a molecule that we discovered about more than 20 years ago as a key part of the mechanism which turns the receptors off, it turns them off with respective G-protein signaling but at the same time, we’ve only come to appreciate recently, serves as an alternate signaling mechanism. Now it turns out that you can design drugs which will activate signaling either through the G-protein or the /- – -/ through the same receptor. For some drugs it turns out that the desired effect through that drug actually is being mediated through G-proteins, but some of the side effects are being mediated through β-arrestin signaling or vice versa. If you had a drug which can target one or the other mechanism you may be able to get a few side effects, in fact there are several examples of such compounds which are now on early phase clinical trials. So that may be an example of how my work in recent years may have implications for getting even more specific drugs with less side effects than we’ve had.";335;Meaning (Values) of Work
And as for the crystal structure?;Brian Kobilka: I think there are two ways that we might facilitate the development of more selective drugs. One is as we learn more and more about the binding pockets particularly how related receptors are so similar to each other in terms of /- – -/ assets from the binding pocket. We’re discovering that just outside of the binding pocket there’s greater diversity that could be sampled and in some drugs do sample this, for example it’s a structure that we recently obtained that hasn’t been published yet, it’s a drug called /- – -/ which is used to treat asthma. It’s extraordinarily selective for the β2 over the β1 and it is partly because it extends out of the, what we call /- – -/ pocket into more of the /- – -/ surface samples between β1 and β2. I think that’s an opportunity for the structures will give us an opportunity to actually design drugs that might be more selective. The other is to take advantage of unconventional binding pockets. First of all there are also allosteric binding pockets that are for example the most clinic receptors are well-known. There may be other druggable surfaces on the receptor including surfaces on the inside of the receptor that we might explore, that will also have greater structural differences from even close related receptors, say for β1 and β2. Those are a couple of opportunities to develop more selective drugs.;335;Meaning (Values) of Work
So for the first time it is really possible to use the structure to do structure aided drug design?;Brian Kobilka: Yes, and I think a colleague of ours, Brian Shoichet, has really been at the fore front of using computational /- – -/ and shown, as he likes to say, that GCPRs is really great binding pockets for /- – -/ screening.;335;Creativity
I was going to ask the last question, does it matter how it is labelled, does it matter whether it is chemistry or biochemistry?;"Robert J. Lefkowitz: I think in a sense not. I think what it shows is just how the interface between chemistry and biology and medicine … I have been called a lot of things in my time, not all pleasant, but I can handle chemist. Over the years, people have always gone: Well Bob, you’ll win the Nobel Prize someday. It was nice to hear although it didn’t seem to be happening, but if it happened, I always assumed it would be in medicine and not in chemistry. I think I have Brian to thank for that.
Brian Kobilka: I think I might even take a little at it to like in being awarded the chemistry prize. I think medicine and physiology are wonderful as well, but I’ve sort of been a chemist and want to be for the years.";335;Research
And this is because this picture you had seemed to defy the possibilities that were allowed under crystallography in those days?;Dan Shechtman: That is correct. But it was not one picture, it was a long series of experiments. The famous diffraction picture is one of very many experiments, all done by electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy. So, he gave me the book and said, Please read. I said, I know this book, I am a teacher at the Technion I teach these things and I don’t need to read it. I am telling you this is something different, it’s not in the book. He took the book and sometime later – now I don’t remember how many days or how many hours it was – but he came back and said, Danny, you are a disgrace to my group and I want you to leave my group, I don’t want to be associated with this. So he moved to another group. This didn’t mean much, it sounds traumatic but it was not, I just had to find another group leader who would to adopt me – the orphan, the scientific orphan – and somebody did. The only amendment was instead of reporting to this secretary I reported to that secretary. I didn’t move from my office or from my laboratory, it was just about the same, so it was not very traumatic – now when people hear about it, Wow, thrown away from your group! Yes, but it was, not for me at least, it was not traumatic. It was not nice, I didn’t feel very good about it, but … This was a span of reactions between encouragement and rejection – and everything was somewhere in between.;336;Life
What was the project that you were actually doing, because you weren’t looking for quasicrystals, you were making these alloys. What were you off looking for?;Dan Shechtman: My project … Let me start a little bit earlier. I came to NBS for my first sabbatical from the Technion. This is six years after I became a faculty, on the seventh year we have a sabbatical. I went there and actually stayed for two years, I requested one year of leave of absence. The sponsor was DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. They wanted me to develop aluminum base alloys for aerospace applications. I did it with a technique called rapid solidification in which you take a metal, you melt it and you solidify it, but very quickly, very rapidly. We had some instruments to do that, to solidify. When you rapidly solidify you move away from the /- – -/ stability, it is not /- – -/ to make them stable. You receive structures, meaning atomic arrangements which you cannot receive if you slowly cool.;336;Creativity
You capture different structures?;Dan Shechtman: They form, different structures form. I started to work on an alloy that they gave me upon my arrival, it was an aluminum alloy. They said, Oh Danny, before you prepare your own alloys, here is something that we have for you, we already prepared this, so I started to work on aluminum alloys. Then there was a phase there which was close to aluminum six iron that was not stable. I wanted to see how it looks when it is stable, so I prepared alloys from, instead of aluminum iron aluminum manganese and I prepared a series of alloys – 1 % manganese, 2 %, 5 %, 10 % – maybe 10 alloys. In the aluminum 25 % manganese there it was. Let me tell you something that is a little bit educational. The person who sponsored me in DAPA – now this is department of defense of the United States – he knew me, and he said, Danny, you have a very nice proposal which I am sponsoring, but I am telling you run wild. Do whatever you want! Don’t just stick to the proposal, just run wild. What did it mean? You see, aluminum 1 % manganese, maybe up to 5 % manganese can be used for, but 15 %, 25 % is almost powder. You cannot make anything useful for aerospace from that. But I felt free to do whatever I wanted. You start from applications, but you end up in good science.;336;Creativity
That’s a lovely thing to bring up because so often we sit talking to Nobel Laureates who have been doing basic science and they have come up with a basic discovery, and naturally people start asking, What is the application? In your case you were doing applied research, and the basic research was your side piece – it’s very nice. Is the lesson to learn from that even when thinking that you are directing people down the applied search tracks there should always be the space for play?;Dan Shechtman: You should look around and pay attention to something odd. When I talk to young students, I can give them ten advice but I always give them one advice. If you want to succeed in something – become an expert in that field. You can start becoming an expert now, when you are a high school student. Choose a subject that may interest you and in today’s world information is regularly available to everybody everywhere. Choose a subject and become an expert. If you have questions call a professor in the university, he will talk to you, he will explain to you. Find out who are the people who are the masters of that field and talk to them. Become an expert and it will carry you a long way.;336;Creativity
Because expertise will always be sort out by others?;Dan Shechtman: No, because as an expert you will … When you will discover something you will trust your findings. Also you are right. It pays to become an expert and sometimes it doesn’t. Let me give an example. In my early days in academia, I was going to the US every summer to work there. I am a material scientist and I wanted to be labelled material scientist, but I was labelled as an electron microscopist instead. One summer I called them and asked, Can I come this summer? He said, No, this summer we don’t need any electron microscopist. I said, Now wait, I am a material scientist. No, no, but you are a good electron microscopist. I was labelled as an electron microscopist. Sometimes it is good, sometimes it is not very good to put a label on somebody in a narrow filed.;336;Creativity
We’ll come back to quasicrystals in a minute, but I just wanted to make a brief digression into becoming an expert because how did you become an expert yourself, how did you become a material scientist?;"Dan Shechtman: Let me tell you. When I was very young, in the fifth grade in elementary school, I was very interested in nature and science. The nature teacher – we had a subject called nature – which is now called science – then it was called nature – said to the children, You know we have a microscope in school, and my eyes opened like that. What? Can you bring it to the class? He said, Yes, of course. The next week he didn’t bring it and the next week he didn’t bring it and I begged him and begged him, so finally he brought it to the class and put it on the table. It was a microscope like this, a very primitive one, but I had never seen one before. He put a sample of a leaf or an insect, I don’t know what it was, I think it was a leaf or something. He said, Dan, you showed an interest in this so you will be first to look. I came and I stood at his desk and I was looking, Wow, it was so amazing. He said, OK Dan, sit down. I said, Wait a minute, I was so fascinated. Then I said, Maybe you could bring it to the class every week or may I come to the warehouse where you store it, can I work on it? No, he said, one time is enough, and he never brought it again.
This was my first encounter with a microscope, it was a small, primitive optical microscope. When I did my master’s degree at the Technion the first transmission microscope arrived at the Technion and I immediately pounced on it. I was circling around when they assembled it, asked so many questions, and looked at it – more like a mechanical engineer than anything else, just wanted to see the construction. Then I became one of the first operators of the electron microscope. At that time we were used to fix the electron microscope ourselves, there was no technician, we did it. People ask me, Did you spend time on the microscope or under the microscope? It was equal time, but I learned how the microscope works, really, learned the technique. Then my PhD was already on electron microscopy.";336;Creativity
There was a gap in your history between the microscope you were showed once and then was taken away and your master’s degree. Somebody else must have encouraged you. Was there one person or someone who pushed you?;Dan Shechtman: Yes, I can say that there was one professor that arrived at my department from Cambridge in England. He was /- – -/ microscopy, one of the first in electron microscopy, David Brandon. He was my thesis supervisor for PhD. I came to him when I did my master and said, Will you instruct me for a PhD and he said, Of course, why not. This is the way we started, and he gave me the first lessons about electron microscopy. He did some other thing that should be told, he introduced me to the masters of electron microscopy of the time. Most of them were from England and from Belgium. They came to visit him and he invited me to his home every time somebody came to visit. He introduced me to this community. This is important, this is a lesson to be learned. Later on, he sent me to an international school of electron microscopy in Erice, Italy – Sicily actually. That was another important thing – send your students to become experts.;336;Mentors (Role models)
It’s a nice way to be made immortal to have a reaction named after you, I think. If we turn to the cross-coupling reaction we’ve just being discussing. It began with you, Professor Heck, in working at Hercules company, I think, and you were exploring palladium’s ability to do interesting things. You weren’t actually looking for a cross-coupling reaction?;Richard F. Heck: No, I wasn’t, it just happened. I recognised it and I thought it would be something useful so that why I studied it.;337;Research
When you publish papers on this, you publish them as a single author, which implies that you were working very much alone, was that the case?;Richard F. Heck: Yes. Well, I had a non-technical assistant, but I only had to put my name on it.;337;Creativity
Were you left free to play in this industrial environment?;Richard F. Heck: I was in their basic research group, just a small group that could try anything, I guess, if they thought it might be useful. They left us alone pretty much, at least for a while.;337;Life
And were you aware that palladium would act as a catalyst to bring carbon atoms together in this way?;Richard F. Heck: Well, there were some things in the literature that suggested it might a be useful reagent for doing that kind of chemistry, yes. There were some early people in this field who did some good chemistry, like Koetz, remember? Koetz and Calvin, I remember those people, which was one very early but nobody seemed to follow it up.;337;Future research
Was your company keen to make money out of your research?;Richard F. Heck: That is was what it was supposed to do, I don’t think I did much for them, but that’s the reason for why I’m not there anymore.;337;Environment
You weren’t patenting the method or anything like that?;Richard F. Heck: They patented everything that they thought could possible conceivably be useful, so some of it was patented I think.;337;Dealing with difficulties
I guess, but when do you think its power was seen?;Richard F. Heck: I couldn’t put a date on it. It’s a slow process, it just happens slowly. To make a decision on when it started, I don’t know, it’s hard to say.;337;Research
When you moved into organic chemistry as a young man, was it the desire to solve problems such as how to convert CO2 or other things that drove you there or was it general inquisitiveness, were you applied or just curious?;Richard F. Heck: I enjoyed working with chemicals, I do things and make all kinds of perfumes and things that interested me in my first few years of my studies and I expanded on that and it’s useful to make all kinds of materials that you might want to use, technical materials for example.;337;Motivation
Were you a childhood chemist?;Richard F. Heck: Yes, that was in my early teenage years I started chemistry.;337;Creativity
And last, Richard Heck. Working alone, maybe you didn’t have a mentor, or was there somebody?;Richard F. Heck: I worked with Winstein first where I got my degree and he taught me physical organic chemistry and I didn’t follow that up, I got into more organometallic chemistry as I went into industry. So, in industry I tried to make money for the company mostly so they were directing my work more or less.;337;Mentors (Role models)
Richard Heck, Ei-ichi Negishi, Akira Suzuki, welcome to Stockholm and Nobel week. Professors Negishi and Suzuki, you have just arrived from Japan where you were together, being feted. Do you enjoy all the attention that this brings?;"Akira Suzuki: Well, I think maybe I want to enjoy it. How about you?
Ei-ichi Negishi: I feel that it’s part of the prize and probably the best thing is for me to enjoy it and provide hopefully my best service too.";338;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Yes, but within the chemical world, very important world, there is so much of carbon-carbon chemistry is done using these reactions. It’s a nice part of chemistry, organic chemistry, that the reactions named after their inventors. So, all these characters live on through the pages of the organic synthesis textbooks. Do you know where that convention came from, that reactions should be named after the people who made them?;Ei-ichi Negishi: No, I don’t, but there are several books based on so-called name reactions and I had an occasion to go through some of them and after the World War II, there have been just about 100 names, given to 100 reactions. So that means maybe two per year.;338;Research
I want to pick up on this halfway point, because there is this marvellous abundance of molecules out in nature, that we look at and try to emulate and sometimes build and sometimes try to improve upon and then there are textbooks full of reaction schemes which allow one to think about how to put things together to make them. And you’re saying that we’re about, as an estimation, halfway towards the goal of filling those textbooks to the absolute limit. How does one estimate how many reactions there are to be discovered?;Ei-ichi Negishi: Halfway means not necessarily in sort of a volume of things that we cover. Typically, organic compounds, we can consider in terms of ten or so dozen different kinds of functional groups – alkyl, alkene olefin, acetylene, aromatics, acyl, etcetera. About ten or a dozen. If you take a look at the organic chemistry textbook, then you see their discussion, discussions of them, in a dozen or twenty chapters, so that’s organic chemistry. If you consider ten or so as R1 group, and then similar ten or so, as R2 group, then you have ten times ten, a hundred combinations. If you can hook them at will, as you wish, then that’s the whole organic framework construction. You understand? Forget about other functional details but in this, in our approach, functional groups can be there, can be placed as needed. And then, when time for coupling the two together, we do that.;338;Research
So, as well as varying the substituents that goes into the reaction, one can also vary the transition metal catalyst and then that just opens up a whole new spectrum of possibilities. The idea that we can solve all these problems of how to link the different functional groups together, suggests that there might be an end to the development of organic chemistry, that organic chemistry, the synthetic methodology, could reach a point which you say right, it is, we have what we need and then it just building what we need. Do we really foresee such a time?;Ei-ichi Negishi: In a very, very long time … This is only one mode of organic synthesis, very, very general, very important mode, but I have been recently telling people, organic synthetic chemists have a major, major task right now which we want to solve. That is, how to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrate, which nature does in a biochemical way, biological way. But no synthetic chemist has yet to claim this laboratory way, or factory way, of doing the same thing. I think this is a very, very important task because if we can do that economically, which we should be able to do, then we will solve a food problem, energy problem and a pollution problem, because CO2 is a starting material, we need more rather than less. And I cite this one because I believe, firmly believe, as in nature, D-block transition metals, in the case of biological process, it’s iron, iron is a D-block transition metal. It is going to be critically needed, probably one electron transfer process, radical kind of chemistry, rather than our nice two electron transfer processes, like the Heck-reaction or the Suzuki. Because there are two electron transfer process reactions.;338;Future research
So you would promote the study of and research on the D-block transition metal as a major area?;Ei-ichi Negishi: I’m just presenting this as an example of a major goal, right in front of us. We want to solve this today or maybe in a year’s time or ten years’ time and no one right now we have a feeling that we should be able to do that because nature does, nature has been doing that for billions of years. It’s a big shame for the entire group, including ourselves. What I’m saying is that, this is just one of the major pending goals. You talked about our tasks being reduced, eventually to zero. I don’t think that time will come pretty soon.;338;Environment
That’s a good message. I don’t suppose that is was money who drove you to chemistry originally? What was it that made you adopt chemistry as your subject?;Ei-ichi Negishi: Well, as an elementary school kid, I liked maths, very crisp. Then I thought I was going to major double E, electrical engineering, fascinating electronics, then I switched to chemistry, perhaps a little bit for money, because someone told me in electrical industry, the pay is not so good. So, my motivation was very impure but looking back I think that I chose the right field for me, because it’s not so mathematical, you know, it’s not like maths, it’s not cut and dry. And yet I didn’t develop my liking towards biologically oriented areas, because there were so many unknowns, so many nebulous kinds of things, many things were so in between, so they didn’t appeal to me. And now chemistry is sort of in between, between two extremes and I love that and I think this is an area where we can exercise our imagination and we can have many useful discoveries and development and then overall impact is, the works for the benefit of mankind. So, looking back I am very glad that I chose chemistry and I am recommending this to many young people, by saying that.;338;Motivation
Sort of feet on the ground and head in the air. Do you find young people are coming to chemistry to a sufficient degree in the States? You have been teaching in Purdue for many years, do you find that?;Ei-ichi Negishi: From our perspective, probably we are finding fewer and fewer younger people to be sufficiently qualified to be trained by us at the graduate level, that’s what my main interest is in and that’s been one of my concerns.;338;Motivation
It’s no longer seen as a better paid alternative. Why do you think they are not coming?;Ei-ichi Negishi: As you said, probably they are gravitating towards the areas that obviously look more lucrative. One of my grandchildren, he is major in business, not chemistry, not science, maybe for that reason.;338;Diversity in sicence
Herbert Brown was obviously an enormous influence on you as well, Professor Negishi. Is there something in particular that you remember about him that encapsulates his approach?;Ei-ichi Negishi: There are many, many, but I think he is a master of how to handle difficulties or failures and turn them into success. And I believe we all learned how to deal with those hard situations, and he had many, many, so usually he had so many plans.;338;Mentors (Role models)
Richard Heck, Ei-ichi Negishi, Akira Suzuki, welcome to Stockholm and Nobel week. Professors Negishi and Suzuki, you have just arrived from Japan where you were together, being feted. Do you enjoy all the attention that this brings?;"Akira Suzuki: Well, I think maybe I want to enjoy it. How about you?
Ei-ichi Negishi: I feel that it’s part of the prize and probably the best thing is for me to enjoy it and provide hopefully my best service too.";339;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What about you Professor Suzuki, what lead you to chemistry when you were young?;"Akira Suzuki: Well, I think, recently I don’t know … as a young student in Japan … people say young Japanese boys and girls they never feel so much interest in the science, including the chemistry, physics and so on. But, so this time, after I get the Nobel Prize, decided I received the Nobel Prize, I have a main chance to talk with press people, they say in Japan, the young people they don’t like science and technology, but I think, in Japan of course as you know, in Japan we don’t have any enough resources. We don’t have any petroleum, not have any iron resources, we only have coal mining resources but that is located so deep under the ground, so it takes lot of money to cut from down to up. So, in Japan the important thing is, we, they make a very nice product, then we sell such a product to all over the world. That is the only way Japan people, we continue our country, in such a meaning, we have to say to young people, you have to explain our situation. And one way we can continue our Japan is, to feel very much interest in science and technology, to make very nice products to sell to the world.
In such a meaning, I say, the Japanese government and the professors, we say such a thing to the younger people and he join us to pay much interest in our chemistry, not only the chemistry, the science and the physics. But in such a meaning, I always say, the other day, I got the chance to talk with Prime minister of Japan, after I received the Nobel Prize, so I emphasised this thing to our Prime minister. He is also a scientist, physics is his major, so he understands very well, but unfortunately many of the people in our government, don’t understand very much more of science and technology, so I think it’s important in the government to understand such a situation and to give lot of research money. Of course, at this moment, Japanese, our economical situation is very, not so nice, even though I asked the Prime minister our government understands such a situation to support the science and the technology and to give research money for such a field and also reasonable money to the education That is very important. I just say such to government people recently.";339;Motivation
Let’s return to Herbert Brown, Professor Brown, what was it that he taught you?;Akira Suzuki: I think, he gave us many things, one thing I still knew about that he said that is, “You have to study, your research leader should be in textbook”. So, that means, you have to find your chemistry just new field of the chemistry, so, if such a new chemistry should appear on the textbook, so he always says you have to do your study which appears in the textbook. And also, I often say, the thing is a little bit different, but I always say to students, you have to do the basic, in Japan we have a special box. In the box we put the rice, how do you say in English? That is a kind of the rice box or something like that.;339;Mentors (Role models)
Given how ubiquitous surface chemistry is, it might be thought to be a little surprising that this is the first Nobel Prize for surface chemistry since Irving Langmuir got it in 1932. Is part of the problem that it’s very difficult to study surface chemistry?;Gerhard Ertl: It’s certainly very difficult to study and as you mentioned Irving Langmuir, he was really groundbreaking, as his ideas, but many of these ideas couldn’t be studied at that time because we needed new techniques and /- – -/ This started only in the 1960s and ‘70s, that’s why surface chemistry is a relatively new field of chemistry in this sense.;346;Research
What are the challenges, the difficulties in the instrumentation that one faces?;Gerhard Ertl: If you are interested to learn what is really taking place on an atomic scale on the surface, you have to keep in mind that the structure of a solid surface is usually very complex. It consists of different crystal planes, different defects, different compounds at the surfaces and if you expose it to an atmosphere, then impurities from the gas face will accumulate there, so it’s very badly defined. If you want to study really the elementary processes, you first have to start with preparation of clean and well defined surfaces. It needs very high vacuum and the use of single crystal surfaces. This was the event of surface science in the 1960s, when this whole field started.;346;Creativity
That’s a lovely challenge. Has it made any practical difference to the process, that you now understand?;Gerhard Ertl: With the knowledge about the process and about the rates of the individual steps, it was also possible to develop a kinetic model and this was done by people in Denmark working with Haldor Topsoe, the company who is one of the big manufacturer of plants for the ammonia synthesis. They tell me, now in the meantime, they developed their plants on the basis of data they have about the kinetics, so it makes it much, much easier for them also.;346;Creativity
You defined the rate limiting steps for the reaction?;Gerhard Ertl: Yes, that’s right and we identified also other steps and with all this knowledge putting together, these people, Nørskov and his co-workers, they were able to develop this kinetic model.;346;Research
One of the things that you’re known for is that you re-visit problems, when a new technology becomes available, you go back to an old problem that you studied previously and you’ll study it again using the new technology. Is the Haber Bosch process one of those that you have looked at more than once?;Gerhard Ertl: We continue to work on this because there was still the question is the iron catalyst the best catalyst? It was invented almost 100 years ago and, in the meantime, there are other catalysts being proposed, mainly by Japanese workers based on ruthenium and indeed it seems to be a better catalyst than iron but it’s very hard to transform this on an industrial scale and …;346;Creativity
Do you think it’s unusual that you re-visit problems?;Gerhard Ertl: I don’t think so. Whenever you solve a problem or answer a question, you are faced with two or three new ones so you are still left with open questions. I think it’s not very unusual that you go back to another question which you had left a couple of years ago.;346;Creativity
What led you to surface chemistry in the first place? What was your path that ended up there?;Gerhard Ertl: I am not a chemist, I am a physicist, but I was always interested in both chemistry and physics and that’s why I did my first degree where the diploma work was a physical chemist and he was a famous electro-chemist. Electrochemistry is the science of solid/liquid interface, with charge transfer. I did my first work on the reactions in liquid fase but then I wanted to continue for my PhD and I asked my thesis advisor, Is there anything else I could do – everybody here in the laboratory is working on electro-chemical systems? He told me, We know quite a bit about solid/liquid interfaces, but very little about solid/gas interfaces. There is no electrochemistry. If you think you could start with that, you can do it as you like. He gave me completely free way and this was the advantage. He was not an expert in this field but he just trusted me and that’s how I came interested in that.;346;Motivation
When you yourself recruit students to your lab, and you’ve recruited many, what do you look for in them? What are you trying to identify in a new student?;Gerhard Ertl: First of all, I had about the same number of students from physics and chemistry and this is very advantageous because both parts have their pros and contrasts and their collaboration was always very fruitful. Then I always check if they are really motivated and interested. It’s not so much the marks they got in their examinations but are they curious enough and also brave enough to take a new problem? You can recognise that very early and I think that was, shall we say, a recipe which worked.;346;Competencies
You can recognise their passion for the science?;Gerhard Ertl: Definitely, yes. If somebody really gets interested in a problem, you’ll explain to him.;346;Motivation
You say you have an equal mix of chemists and physicists. Is it easy to get the physicists to come across to what is essentially a chemistry environment?;Gerhard Ertl: Yes, because the methods we are applying are physical methods, so many, many physics students are really interested to see what they can do with the physical techniques. These are problems they are usually not faced with, so I never have problems to get good students from physics.;346;Diversity in sicence
Ok, that’s what you look for in them. What do you think that they look for in you? What are they hoping to get from you as a mentor?;Gerhard Ertl: I think there is a lot of networking between the students. They know in advance what kind of professor is that. They told me that many years later, very often, I went to you because my friend said you should go there and so, yes, and obviously …;346;Mentors (Role models)
And in the main they respond well to that?;Gerhard Ertl: Oh yes. This is just the kind of responsibilities they get in this way. Of course I was told later that very often I had convinced them to do something else than they had in mind but they always agreed that later this was the right decisions I made.;346;Environment
Your students must have gone off and inhabited many, many other departments?;Gerhard Ertl: I’ve many students now who are professors at universities or in leading positions. I’m very proud about that, I must say.;346;Advice for young researchers
A question that I often ask, but what is it that you enjoy the most about the practice of science? About the science that you do?;Gerhard Ertl: I think it’s always an adventure to ask a question and to enter a new field where you don’t know the answer in advance. If you then get an answer and if this answer is really surprising, this creates a great joy, always. And this continues, yes.;346;Motivation
And do you enjoy the lab work very much?;Gerhard Ertl: That’s right, yes. I have spent quite some time with the laboratory. I’m no longer working with my hands but just discussing with the people there and so on. It’s very rewarding also to see how the results come out.;346;Creativity
Why do you no longer work with your hands?;Gerhard Ertl: I’m retired. I retired three years ago, so I no longer have a laboratory any more. The more advanced you get, the more other responsibilities you have. You are no longer able to really spend hours in the laboratory, that’s correct. You have to rely on your co-workers and I had always the luck to have excellent co-workers.;346;Life
What are your feelings about the future of German, European science? Are you optimistic about the way things are going?;Gerhard Ertl: I think the research going on in Europe is not of the same quality as the research going on in the United States. Also funding, of course, that would need better funding for research but this is not the main issue. The main problem of our universities is the structure, the undergraduate training and the structure of the universities. There are many, many students who leave the university after two or three years or so and there is no real challenge for them. They’re just there and of course many professors are a little bit frustrated because they don’t get the support for their teaching which would be necessary. This is something which has to be reformed, quite obviously.;346;Environment
Right, and tuition fees would add that driving force?;Gerhard Ertl: Yes, of course. As soon as you have to pay something … If you don’t pay for something it’s not worthwhile. We have a long standing debate on this issue in our country at the moment and some parts of Germany now have introduced small tuition fees and I think that will help.;346;Environment
That’s nice. But presumably there is perhaps now a pressure to take part in further planning for the future of German science, as a Nobel Laureate?;Gerhard Ertl: So far, I was not approached directly in this respect but, as I told you, I was for many years vice president of the German Science Foundation. I was always involved in the planning of the research funding in Germany so I am familiar with the attempts to improve the situation for German research and I’m sure that I will also be approached in the future again.;346;Impact of the Nobel on you
On the subject of being a Laureate, how are you finding it? How have you found the last couple of months since the announcement?;Gerhard Ertl: Hectic and chaotic, so it still needs some time for me to really recover from the announcement, I must say, because now many, many people approach you and want answers to questions you never had thought before and on quite different things.;346;Impact of the Nobel on you
Do you have any intentions of how to use the status of being Nobel Laureate in the future or is it too early to say?;Gerhard Ertl: I still have to recover from all these hectic weeks now, so after Christmas, I will retreat into my resort and stay there for a week or so and just think over the whole situation.;346;Impact of the Nobel on you
You know what pinnacle’s like here. I’d like to turn first to the relationship between biology and chemistry. You work on a system which many would think of as a very fundamental biological mechanism, and yet you’ve been awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry. Why is that?;"Roger Kornberg: In the very first place the work we’ve done is purely chemical. The discovery for which the prize was given is the arrangement of atoms in a large molecule, that is as much the definition of chemistry I think one could hope to define. Beyond that, and I think it’s important to bear in mind that what we study is not so much biology as life chemistry, so the answers to the questions that we have about biology all lie at the level of chemistry, and the thrust of modern biologic science and modern biomedicine is to discover of a chemical basis for all that goes on.
Now, it’s also worth mentioning my background is from chemistry, and the work that lead up to the structure for which the prize was given began in what I did, which even the most traditional chemist would today regard as the proper domain of chemistry, so this sprang from chemistry, what eventually emerged is indisputably chemistry, the connection to biology is in explaining a life process. One last point on those lines, what is traditionally the preserve of chemistry always involved the study of molecules derived from nature, one of the most classical undertakings in traditional organic chemistry has been the structure determination of the total synthesis of molecules derived from nature, some of the famous molecules that you know of, vitamin B12, chlorophyll, what have you, these are all molecules derived from nature, many organic chemists over the years pursued the structures and synthesis of alkaloids derived from nature, protein molecules nucleic acids are no less or more chemical molecules than vitamins or alkaloids.";347;Impact of the Nobel on you
We hear constantly though that chemistry as a discipline is rather under fire, and that people are not going into chemistry in the way they used to, so do you think it matters how one labels the research? For instance you work in a department of structural biology, is it important the label which one gives to the research one does?;"Roger Kornberg: You’ve come absolutely to the heart of the matter, so labels were once applied as a way of identifying the distinct nature of the various disciplines, of course the boundaries have become blurred, the disciplines have to some extent merged, I think labels are always useful for administrative purposes of dividing up research groups into manageable units and the traditional labels from the past are just as useful for that purpose today as they ever were before.
The fact remains that as I said the boundaries have blurred, but what is more, the work that we do in the structural biology department is it’s in some places done in the departments of chemistry and in other places done in departments of biology, beyond that I might add that in my personal view chemistry is really the queen of the sciences, chemistry is the common ground for all scientific investigation. So our best hope of applying physical principles for the world around us is at the level of chemistry, our best hope of understanding the biological organism and ultimately the form and function of the human body is at the level of chemistry. I have said before and I would repeat that if there is any one subject that an educated person should know in the world that is chemistry.";347;Roles of Science
Nice message. So would you describe the work you do as interdisciplinary? Or do you think that’s a very overused term these days?;Roger Kornberg: In the sense that what were traditionally regarded as distinct disciplines have come together in our work then it would be regarded as interdisciplinary, people have remarked that the culmination that we make of functional studies commonly referred to as biochemistry with structural studies, which more commonly lie in the province of physical chemistry is distinctive. For myself I see really no alternative, I think the problems that we study and that others will do of a similar nature in the future can only be approached in this way.;347;Meaning(Values) of Work
When you chose students, young people, to come into the lab do you look for any particular background in them or … I think there’s an increasing tendency for people to want to use lots of different techniques in their research, they tend to quickly want to quickly want to jump to the point of using lots of things, is that something that you would go against?;"Roger Kornberg: I have a very straight forward answer to your question, the one thing I look for is chemistry.
Roger Kornberg: People come to my lab from a background in biology, they come from a background in physics, and the question I always ask is about their training in chemistry, if they have studied chemistry then what chemistry did they study and how well did they do it. If someone comes along who has studied physical and organic chemistry and then obviously been good at it, then I know that they will fit in well, that they will succeed in what we do.";347;Competencies
You yourself became interested in science at a very young age, do you think that that’s an essential attribute of a scientist to have become a scientist when they were still a child?;"Roger Kornberg: I would say that my own serious interest in chemistry dates from high school, and I think that’s not uncommon, that young people’s interests become defined at that age as they grow to maturity and they think seriously or can begin to comprehend what lies within them concerning the logical or natural directions they’ll pursue. I was exposed to science at a younger age but I don’t think that mattered so much as the inspiration I drew from a particular chemistry teacher in high school.
was very fortunate that I studied chemistry in high school during a narrow window of time when the particular textbook that was used was of an exceptional nature, I’ve … it was from a programme in the state of California put together by a large number of practicing chemists who wanted to convey the principles of chemistry, and they did so superbly well, I learned the principles and they have served me all my life, and I think I’ve had an advantage over many others because I was taught so effectively at that time, these principles became deeply engrained and they stuck in mind, the course consisted of a series of very simply but well chosen chemical experiments each of which illustrated a principle in a way, which as I say I myself found unforgettable.";347;Family/Home Environment
Having explored a little what you look for in your students, what do you think your students look for in you? What makes a good mentor?;Roger Kornberg: My opinion about that is quite straight forward, I think that the relationship between student and mentor in my lab, and doubtless in many others, is one of equals pursuing the solution of a problem. And I think what I know my students look to me for guidance but I don’t seek to guide so much as to share, at the end of what is often quite some years of mutual struggle with a problem, and more often than not a period of frustration and in the case of the student significant self doubt, there comes a resolution, a discovery or an answer to the question or a way of surmounting whatever obstacle it was that confronted us. And that has the affect of binding us together as lifelong friends because we shared that struggle, and then has the effect on the student of giving the most important thing which is not so much specific information or even knowledge of how to attack a scientific problem as the self confidence, the belief, the knowledge that one can struggle with something which seems to be at some stage impossible and then ultimately succeed. I think if there’s anything I can convey to the people who work with me it’s ultimately that belief in one’s capacity to succeed and eventually a satisfactory outcome.;347;Mentors (Role models)
It might not be a sensible question but what is that you think drives you? Is it trying to find the solution to individual problems? Or is it just a fascination in the area you study in general?;Roger Kornberg: It’s the conventional wisdom about scientists is they’re driven by curiosity. The other common reason that is supposed why people do it is some form of altruism, wanting to do something that is good for people if be enviromedicine or for the world in some other area. I think almost all scientists do it for the reason I do which is the challenge of solving problems, and naturally we grapple with specific problems, if one can’t … and the key to solving them is actually to keep narrowing the focus until finally one has redefined the problem in a way that it can be solved, so the answer to your question is very much what motivates us and our source of satisfaction is in grappling with specific issues, and then as I say having the pleasure of finally discovering the way to either overcome a technical limitation or find an answer to a paradox about the material or whatever it may be.;347;Motivation
You also focused on this area that, it may be a meaningless question, but how do you avoid getting excited by problems that lie outside of the mainstream of what you’re studying? Because there must be lots of distracting nuggets that you could find?;"Roger Kornberg: So on the one hand I would say that one of the things that I most enjoy about science, especially 20 years ago, was the possibility at that time of being interested in everything going on in science and following it and attempting to think in a creative way about almost every area of science, this was the style of Linus Pauling, and of other people of that stature who I admired and may have wished to emulate, but above all it was just the general fascination with science, there isn’t one area that’s more interesting than another and it was fun to learn about, as an undergraduate student I learned about and tried to study in the greatest depth that I could all areas of science, mathematics, science extending from physics to biology.
Up until about 20 years ago as I say it was possible to be aware of what were the outstanding issues in all of the areas, to read the literature, to follow the developments and occasionally to have ideas about them which may have been worthwhile. That ended with the explosion of information and with the exponential growth of science, and today it is simply no longer possible for anyone to be a generalist in the same sense. Even so, the distractions abound because the amount of information in the immediate vicinity of one’s own specific area really exceeds anybody’s possibility for comprehension, and so what I would say, despite the pleasure of the general interest in science before or the need to try and assimilate as much as possible of the relevant information that surrounds one’s own work today, the key to success is ultimately focus, it is in a way what I was saying before, it’s to narrow the description of the problem in a way quite contradictory to the notion of an interdisciplinary approach, on the contrary, one needs to be as narrow as possible to succeed, and the solution of any one problem as particular, and to find it you need to eventually hone in on something that is with pinpoint precision.";347;Advice for young scientists
Given the explosion of science do you think that the finding environment for the sort of long term approach that you’re taking is getting better? Or worse?;Roger Kornberg: I think that funding for a venture of the sort in which we’ve been engaged which extended over a period of many years was never really possible and never really will be, so it isn’t in general possible in the United States or anywhere else that I know of to seek funding for something that is open ended, that has no certain or even very likely prospect of success and it will obviously take a very long time, and the only way such work can be done is to define interim objectives and in the case of the work we do in the United States, and here I don’t know whether the same situation would apply elsewhere, to do related work that can be funded, but to draw upon the funds that are given for that also to pursue these longer term objectives which is very much encouraged in the American system, it’s understood that one may use the funds to do other science and the only constraint is at the end of the day one must demonstrate success.;347;Environment
What about the relationship between basic science and applied science? There’s a tendency for people to say okay, how can we use this, as soon as one reports any result and clearly in this case that question … one can come up with an answer to it, but the question doesn’t really mean that much, this is basic stuff, do you feel that it’s a worrying trend that people always want to apply what one is producing?;Roger Kornberg: On the one hand yes, it is a worrying trend in so far as it diminishes the support available for the pursuit of basic knowledge. On the other hand like all worrying trends in the world they have always been there and they always will be. And what the countervailing force is the drive on the part of individuals to seek the most basic truths and people will find a way, we do in our work, that’s the purpose, we delve as deeply as we can. There is no doubt that the future lies in all regards in the acquisition of increasingly fundamental, so the most basic knowledge, and useful applications always spring from that, and they are limited by the extent of our basic knowledge. That tends to be sometimes forgotten and there’s an understandable tendency on the part of people to want solutions to pressing problems now, nonetheless the drive to discover the most fundamental basis is something which is also strong, it can’t be prevented, it will go on, it will succeed.;347;Meaning (Values) of Work
Shifting track a little bit, one of the things that you’ve described as giving you greatest pleasure is to imagine the molecular machine that you study, and when we spoke in October just after you’d heard the news that you’d been awarded the prize you began to describe how you see it, could I get you to elaborate a little on how you picture this machine working when you see it in your mind’s eye?;Roger Kornberg: What is most fascinating about the very large molecular structure that we discovered from our work over the years is the extent to which it resembles a piece of machinery such as we know from daily life, so molecules have been … a good deal smaller molecules have been studied in the past and they are capable of executing specific transactions. What is astonishing about the piece of machinery that we have investigated, so much larger than those studied previously as I have mentioned, is that it executes many transactions, it contains multiple moving parts, these function in sequence and in ways that we still don’t fully understand, to execute an extraordinarily complex molecular transaction. Now the individual pieces can be viewed as the counterparts of tools or the components of machinery as we know it, and we name them accordingly, so the device that we study has a jaw, it has a rudder, it has parts that we call trigger and lid, and so on.;347;Research
Do you envisage them as solid or fluid?;Roger Kornberg: The components of such molecules must on the one hand be perfectly rigid in order to have a defined shape, much like the parts of a machine, to execute their function. At the same time at appropriate times they’re capable of bending, flexibility, they can adopt multiple states of organisation as appropriate for their function. But I think the underlying principle is one of rigidity and so precise definition in much the same manner as one would envisage a piece of /- – -/ combustion engine or what have you.;347;Creativity
Right. And when people come to ask to work with you on this problem what do you think it is that draws them in first and foremost?;Roger Kornberg: I think that when young people are attracted to research on a particular problem, they likely begin either with an interest in the broad area, in the case of our work most broadly defined it is the area of biological regulation, it is the control of gene expression. In other cases they may also be drawn to the nature of the work, the kinds of technology and manipulations that are involved. I think both are important because after all one must have some degree of fascination with the broader questions, but at the same time the work itself involves many often repetitive activities on a daily basis, and if one can’t take pleasure in the actual manipulations then it will lose its appeal.;347;Creativity
The Nobel Prize will bring yet more notoriety for you and your work, and you’re very, very focused on what you do, how will you, do you think, cope with the increased demands?;Roger Kornberg: In the first place I can tell you that I’m determined I absolutely will go on with the work I do simply because I enjoy it so very much, also because as you mentioned the work has gone on for a very long time and it is a way of life, it would be difficult to adopt a different lifestyle or approach or define the same satisfaction in doing something else now. So I’m inclined to, I will almost certainly decline, most of the offers and temptations to do other sorts of things, and try to maintain the focus, for the reason as I say that it comes naturally and it’s what I enjoy. I wouldn’t, there’s nothing I wish to change about my scientific life before this point, so I have no reason to allow it to happen after.;347;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Thank you. And lastly, Louisetta Moody from the United Kingdom asks whether during the processes of transcription it is necessary to make perfect copies or whether there’s some allowance for error possible?;Roger Kornberg: The answer is at two levels, no process is perfect and mistakes are made. And there are mechanisms for correcting the mistakes, those mechanisms are not perfect either and sometimes the mistakes slip through. Now the mechanisms for correction are extraordinarily, are no less intricate and remarkable than the mechanism of transcription itself. It’s only in the last few months that we’ve actually understood how common errors are avoided and how accuracy is achieved in transcription, and that work from the last several months has only been published in the last week.;347;Research
Two months have gone since you got the message from Stockholm, what happened during this time, Dr Grubbs?;Robert Grubbs: It seems like it’s been a very long time, many things have happened with many interviews and many events. The other fun thing has been many people who I’ve lost track with over the years have gotten back in touch with me, and so we’ve re-established a lot of friendships which we’ve lost over the years.;349;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Could you pursue your work after that?;Robert Grubbs: Yes, it changed a bit but not much. I did return back to California and started teaching a course there and I’ve kept my research group going and written papers and so life goes on. It just adds a few extra things.;349;Creativity
How did you become involved in science if you go back?;Robert Grubbs: For me it was probably goes back to a teacher in junior high, middle school, who was an outstanding teacher and who started challenging me and getting me interested in science, and so it continued from there. It took many different variations along the way until I arrived at chemistry, but it was still always a science emphasis.;349;Motivation
Are you the kind of nerds that do just nothing but science?;Robert Grubbs: I don’t know about that, we do many things. I know Dick has many hobbies as do I, other than chemistry.;349;Personal Characteristics
Did you do walking in New Zealand?;Robert Grubbs: I did walking yes, that was a part of the reason I went to New Zealand, was to walk, I didn’t walk as much I’d like but it was still very good.;349;Life
Did you start to work together then? Or you knew each other before?;"Robert Grubbs: We knew each other long before.
Richard Schrock: We knew each other since the early 1970s I would say.
Robert Grubbs: Early -70’s, yes.";349;Creativity
So this is what you do at conferences?;"Robert Grubbs: Yes, we decided we should never do that again.
Richard Schrock: So Bob did do a lot of further studies with these and similar molybdenum catalysts. I made more variations probably, since I’m an inorganic chemist, so I work more with making and designing catalysts and Bob with applying that chemistry to make polymers, and then really set his sights on organic chemistry. He was the first to really see the possibilities, since he’s an organic chemist, that one could influence organic chemistry powerfully.";349;Creativity
What is the relation between applied science and fundamental science? Can you comment on that?;"Robert Grubbs: I think they naturally sort of flow together, at least for me it’s been. We started out doing very fundamental work, we still do very fundamental work, but you also have to keep an eye for where it might be useful and then point it in that direction. Then once you get it going in the right direction there’s lots of people who will take that then and use it to make things and do the applied stuff. I try to do the fundamental and then point people in the direction that the applied stuff can happen and then there’s all kinds of wonderful people around who takes that and does nice things with it.
Richard Schrock: And the main idea is to control these catalysts and what they do and then you control it by making different catalysts and you know everything about them in a fundamental way, and then you can apply that knowledge to making a polymer of a certain type or doing a certain type of organic reaction. Then you can apply what you know with these catalysts, but it all begins with fundamentals.";349;Meaning (Values) of Work
And they are started by academics?;"Robert Grubbs: In many cases by academics yes.
Richard Schrock: Like him for example.";349;Motivation
So you work with a company and in academia?;"Robert Grubbs: Yes. My job is in academia, but part of getting the technology, the fundamental stuff, we’ve developed two applications which after all one loves to see your stuff used and done. It was essential to build up this middle part and the only way to do that is to be involved in starting a company that is involved in that transition work. I tried doing it lots of other ways but it’s the only real way that I found to do it now. Dick’s also involved in the company too.
Richard Schrock: Yes, but not to such an extent. But they’re trying to get all of metathesis under their roof, I would say, and push it, which is good. And they will try to apply this reaction for pharmaceutical companies or for whoever wants to use it because it’s so universal in the sense that you can go in many directions. It’s a fundamental reaction, you can do many different things with it, and many companies might see some reaction that they could do in fact, and then they would license for example the possibility to do that from this company.
Robert Grubbs: But you need someone there who, as I say, that middle piece is missing, I mean for example DuPont used to do a lot of the fundamental work but they also could do the transition into the very applied stuff. But that’s all missing now. So I think that’s going to be the next generation of the way the technology develops.";349;Environment
There is also a question on going another way. How do you get information about what are the problems in the industry to solve in academia?;Robert Grubbs: Yes, that’s hard, but you don’t have to do that. What I’m finding now is that if you generally go around and you talk about the fundamentals, you talk about the places where the chemistry can be applied. The places where industrial chemists find applications always astounds me, you know, it becomes important and commercially viable, not for some fundamental chemical reason but for some small business reason which I have no idea about. It’s just been really fascinating to watch this happen, and there’s no way you can predict it or even think about it, and so you just put the science out there and get it to the point where people can understand it and use it and then they just find amazing applications.;349;Environment
Can you see it with your students? People who come to the universities?;"Robert Grubbs: I don’t, not in our students, I mean we’re both at institutes of technology which have probably the two highest standards for admission in the US and so our students come in interested in science, wanting to do science, and so for our students that we work with everyday it’s not an issue. It’s outside of that group you see it.
Richard Schrock: And you see it through the funding agencies and the money they get which has, fortunately this year I think increased, but there have been some difficult years, and well, the government statements, our government and any government has positions, and sometimes they are not, shall we say, scientifically what we would like them to be. And that’s something that is very visible and it’s very distressing to see things said that are just not true or certainly debatable at best.
Robert Grubbs: The other thing is when we started out there was a great emphasis on doing fundamental science and over the last number of years … it’s not a bad thing but it’s a different thing, which is that even at the agencies that support fundamental work one has to say where this can be used, the applied end, and see it, and if we’d been starting out that way we’d have never started our work because there was no way in the world one could have imagined where this would go, it was just a fascinating reaction to look at.
Richard Schrock: And now you have to say how is this going to benefit mankind before you even know basically what you are going to discover or develop. We know now what this reaction has done but you cannot predict the future, and to say where it’s going to actually benefit mankind at a point where it’s fundamental research is impossible really.
Robert Grubbs: I mean after 35 years now working on this reaction I still get shocked very often about new thing it can do and new directions it would go in, so it’s a … I hope it stays for a few more years.";349;Environment

When I say the word mentorship, what does that conjure up?;"Aaron Ciechanover: For me it was very important in particular because in my case at least I shared the prize with my own supervisor. And so it means a lot. I was lucky to have an excellent mentor. I don’t know if the word luck is proper here because I picked him by purpose, not because I knew that one day both of us were going to share the Nobel Prize, but I really searched around. And I had the privilege of searching around because I was a physician already, a practising physician and I had my own career, basically paved, or at least I could see where I was heading. But then I decided to change direction and to go to research. I did it already in medical school but then I went back to medicine and I kind of flipped back and forth, back and forth. And I hadn’t made my mind yet.
And then I decided never the less to try science and I went around and explored the possibilities with several potential mentors. And each of them was very clear about his ideas. Let’s do that and let’s do that, and I did that and you know whatever is left here. And Avram was a young investigator, just came back from a post doctoral fellowship, I mean he himself … And there he started to work on protein degradation, basically just corroborated previous findings from the past, some paradoxical findings that protein degradation requires metabolic energy, typically it’s the opposite. When you synthesise proteins you need energy. Why invest energy if you are taking high energy compounds and degrade them into low energy ingredients, which are amino acids? And Avram told me: I don’t know what I am going to do. All I know that I want to identify the system that degrades into solo proteins. I don’t know how to do it, I don’t know where it is, I don’t know how it’s going to look like.
So he had some ideas and for me I said: Wow, that’s wonderful, this risky way. And he said: Let’s take it for two or three years and see, you know, if we are going to bump to the wall, I’ll go back to the OR, to the operations theatre. I had in my mind to be a surgeon. And if I get excited, even if we don’t get results, I mean if I get excited about it I’ll stay. And it was wonderful. Avram is an excellent biochemist, and after a short time we realised that we had something very unusual at hand. And then it continued. I learnt a lot from him. But you know it was kind of a dialogue, an active dialogue. I thought that good mentors, I don’t want to be proud, they need also maybe good students. Certain interaction. But Avram certainly had the idea to work on the system, though he didn’t know what’s behind the corner.";351;Mentor(Role Models)
And do you think you provide good mentorship for your students? Do you follow those principles?;"Aaron Ciechanover: I hope so, I hope so. I am different. You know, we are different people. I think that Avram was a little bit more tight, but that’s okay, I mean that’s his nature. I give them freedom, so I let them drown. I learnt more from my American mentor about mentorship than from him. I let them drown and if they feel that they have taken too much water into the lungs then they know that my door is always open. And so I never turn them down but I want them to evolve you know more independent.
But it’s a matter of taste, of how you go about them. I don’t let them die by drowning, I just let them drown. And I give them all freedom. But it’s a matter of personal style. I encourage them to, I never turn them down by telling them: Oh, you know, you shouldn’t have done it. I always let them do mistakes. But then we analyse the mistakes. I refer them to the literature in the entire lab. Whenever I read something, I refer them to the literature. Many journal’s club, you know, what’s the mistakes? It’s not just reporting on the journal. So it’s maybe a little bit different mentorship but I take, I think, don’t know if good, whether it’s good or bad, you have to ask them, but at least intensive care.";351;Mentors (Role models)
And critical reading of the literature?;"Aaron Ciechanover: And critical reading and critical evaluation of their own results. And they have to write their own papers. For example, I didn’t write my own papers. Avram wrote them, wrote them mostly. I let them write and then we’ll discuss, you know. We read them together and obviously I have the final touch. But, you know, we said: No this figure should be first because this is really the one that was the important and led us into this. And we develop it by logic, figure one, figure two, so we make a story, we make an alphabet out of the paper. And then the discussion. I put a lot of emphasis on the discussion. How did we think about it? What’s, what we still have to find out?
So it’s kind of a more dynamic, of a very dynamic interaction. I feel it a little bit more dynamic than I had with Avram but I think that it’s a matter of taste. I mean it’s not something principle. Altogether I was extremely lucky to have two excellent mentors. One is Avram, with him we found the system. And another one is Harvey Lodish at MIT with whom I post doc-ed. And he gave me, he is a mentor of my own style. I mean he said: Do that but he didn’t go into the details. But then when I came to him with a problem he knew always how to, you know, when he felt that I am derailed he was able to just put me back on by a slight tap on my shoulder and not a push. Just a hint of what to do. And I think that I adapted more his style. But never the less, mentorship is extremely important.";351;Role of literature
When you come to choose a student what do you look for in the student?;"Aaron Ciechanover: First of all I want him to have the background of what I do. I don’t want students to knock on my door and to say whether I have a spot. So the first question that I ask them is: Why me, why not my next door neighbour or my next floor neighbour or whatever. Why me? And then he said: Well, I read about you. I said what did you read? And then he comes and he tells me what did he read. And then I said: What do you think, what shall we do? I mean are there still open questions? I’m not asking them to give me, to come right there with a project. I want to identify the structure motif in the Myc onco protein. I mean we are not going to there. But what do you think about it? And somehow from time to time they’re very naïve about it. I mean they want to develop drugs, but I take it in their proper context. I mean I don’t take this naivety against them. As long as I’m convinced that they’ve read, they know why they picked me, they know the problems in the field, what is still there.
And then I never take a student, I never promise them studentship. I say I take you for a trial. Start work, I’ll pay you, as a technician, super technician, for three or four months. And then I assign them to another student or a post doc, and then I follow them myself, and with them I really carry out a very extensive dialogue along these three months. And then at the end of the three months all the group consults together about first and foremost about the scientific skills. Then also about social skills. We want the lab to be not homogenous but we want people to be good departmental citizens, you know. I very much care about the good atmosphere in the lab. And then we don’t vote but I get the sense and I myself know the candidate and so it’s a process.";351;Competencies
What kind of environment do you encourage? How physically do you organise the lab?;Aaron Ciechanover: Oh the lab is, first of all it’s very well equipped. We are very sophisticated. We have everything that we need almost on the floor, except obviously for proteomics and mass spectrometers. We have all the microscopes and everything that we need, time lapse, fluorescence, ConfoCor, whatever we need we have. And so the lab is very well equipped. My two research associates take care of everything. Cleanliness, orders, badgets, everything, so that’s beyond me. But we’re organised in clusters. So we are working, we are about 15 or 14 people and we are working about three or four projects. So three or four students, typically one post doc and two or three students are working on the same project. But it’s the same by title. They don’t compete against one another. I hate it. They study different aspects of the same problem.;351;Environment
Is it common that people do get their students to compete over the same project do you think?;Aaron Ciechanover: I heard so. I don’t want to comment. But yes I know so. But again I’m not, it’s for me inhumane in the worst sense of the word. So for example now we are studying polycomb complexes, repressive complexes, and they have many components. So one studies one component, the other studies one, and then they can talk to one another and then they share probs. And since the lab is entirely ubiquitin lab, so even between the clusters they can share in the group because everybody understands the language. So one group is working on meek degradation, another group is working on NF-KB, another group is working on polycomb, another group is working on apoptosis. So basically that’s it. Now we have four clusters, about three to four in each. And so it’s mostly kind of collaboration. Collaborative efforts but never the less very distinct individual projects.;351;Competencies
And are there are any tricks you use in the way you organise the space to get them to collaborate more than they would otherwise?;Aaron Ciechanover: They are in bays. I mean the lab is very spacious. We designed it. You know it was an empty floor and we designed it to our needs. We were working against the architects for a year and a half and it’s a very unique lab.;351;Creativity
How many people are there in the lab in total?;Aaron Ciechanover: About 15, we are between 12 and 15 all the time. I keep it this size. I don’t want to go higher because then I lose control, I don’t know what they do and in group meetings I really want to know what they are doing. And don’t go much lower than ten because then we lose projects. It happens, you know, it fluctuates, but it’s about that number all the time.;351;Life
That was fascinating. Thank you. If we turn to your own scientific beginnings, in your Nobel autobiography you write very elegantly and at considerable length about where you came from as a scientist. And you describe that section as falling in love with biology. What was the beginning of the love affair? What got you going?;Aaron Ciechanover: Almost from day one it’s like, but at that time obviously you remember or you know, it was very different biology you know. So I grew up in a city that is in the mountains and much of the city wasn’t settled and the mountain was just open and wild. And I asked my brother. So initially it was simple taxonomy. I collected flowers and dried them out. I think that I wrote in my biography that I dried them out in the Jewish scholarly books, in the Jewish Talmud of my brother, and then he exploded and he got a fit. You know, I took the holiness of the holiness of the Jewish faith and smashed flowers.;351;Motivation
Where did you get the idea from?;Aaron Ciechanover: I got it from books and I read about it and then I pinched my finger and took blood and smeared it over a cover glass. So I just was looking, I was curious, there was no DNA at that time, nothing. I directed myself. But then I didn’t know what’s biology really, even in high school. And then I had to go to the army and then I said Well I don’t know about science. And the army gave us opportunity, the Israeli army, to go and study first and then serve in the Israeli army in our profession. But you couldn’t go to biology because they were not interested in biologists. They were interested in physicians.;351;Creativity
Was it strange studying in a medical school that was the only medical school in Israel at the time?;"Aaron Ciechanover: Israel was at that time a small country of three or four million people. So that’s what we had. Now we have four. And I became restless again and then I decided to take fresh air for one year and I went to do my master’s degree in science. But then I decided never the less to finish because I still have to serve in the army. And it was like flip flopping for a long time. So I finished, I did my master’s degree in biochemistry, fell in love with biochemistry but then went to complete my medical studies.
And then I had to return my service to serve in the Israeli army. I was a combat physician for three years. And then I still didn’t know so I started surgery. I had a short stint in surgery but then I gave up. I said No, I cannot take care of patients and do the same. And then Avram just came back from his post doc fellowship and I was his second, well, we started together, graduate students. I mean I started immediately with a young post-doctoral fellow that just came back and started his own lab.";351;Environment
I mean these days it’s very unusual for people to take three years out to go to the army before doing a PhD. So it would be interesting to know what that gave you. Did it improve?;"Aaron Ciechanover: The army gives one I think, it’s a difficult service but I don’t know if it improves you, but it matures you. You take things in proportion, especially that this was the ’73 war, 1973. I served in the army between ’73 and ’76. I started my military service with the Day of Atonement War and fights and wounded and so on and so forth. So it matures you. And then you learn to live with other people of different educational levels because they just came from destroyed homes. It’s an excellent melting pot.
You know, with the khaki uniform you don’t know who is the man behind unless you know him. And then you get to know him and the people are just wonderful. You know, people that hardly can write or read they all of a sudden became your brothers and you would cook together and it’s very pressed. I was in a missile boat, I was a physician on an Israeli missile boat, and it’s crowded, it’s the hot bed system, you don’t have your own bed. Well, I had because I was an officer but, and then you learn, you don’t want to be above them, you want to be with them. So I took a short course and I was standing near the steering wheel of the …, and I was broadcasting the news that came from the shore every day and I became their friend. And then they cook … I mean it’s like, it’s a wonderful melting pot. It matured me. I wouldn’t have given it up. Also nation wise, you’re entering exam into the nation, it’s something, wonderful experience.";351;Impact of Nobel prize on you
And students coming into your lab now have in general also done military service?;Aaron Ciechanover: Except to the Israeli Arabs. They don’t serve in the military. And I take a lot of Arabs into my lab because I think education, research science is also an important platform for peace, for attenuating religious extremism. And so there are always some Arab Muslim students in my lab. Currently I have two.;351;Environment
Coming to that in a second. As you were working through these discoveries which would take you further and further away from the known universe so to speak, were you not worried that other people, bigger labs, would pick up on what you were publishing and just take it away faster than you could keep up?;"Aaron Ciechanover: You always worry about competition. And there we saw, actually without mentioning names because they are good friends now, we saw them failing around us. Actually we were not the first, if we really probe the history into the date and publication, we were not the first to find the in vitro proteolytic system. Obviously we were the first to fractionate it. There was another good friend, one very famous university in the United States, probably number one university in the United States, huge, starts with H. And he was on, and we were a little bit concerned. But then the beauty of it is, I think, again it’s, you know, we have to be very careful. It’s a retrospective, retroactive analysis.
You cannot, it’s like saying Okay, work on something important that nobody works. I mean this is kind of this type of definition that are non-existing in my mind. But when I analyse it retrospectively why did he fail and he is a good guy, very good guy, I think that he was a proteolysis guy. We worked in parallel. We didn’t take anything from him, absolutely. We were our own. But he was faster or whatever and he published the reticulocytelysate system that we were working on and he was the first to come out. And then he was, we were on the starting line, actually he was ahead of us on the starting line, because he was more … But I think that he was captured with emotion and that tells you how, you cannot be prejudiced and maybe our background … Fred was a proteolysis guy for decades. That’s what he did for life. And I think that he was occupied with a notion that for that this marriage you need only two for this tango. You need a protease and a subscript. He knew that it’s ATP-dependent. But the idea /- – -/ substrate, chymotrypsin substrate.
And he said Well I have something which is ATP-dependent, so it’s some crazy protein, it’s unlike trypsin and chymotrypsin. But never the less it’s still the same door to the tango idea. And whenever he put his protease or extract on a column and fractionated it by whatever method, he lost it because the ubiquitin going this way, he went this way, the protease went this way. And he thought Well I lose it because it’s such a gentle complex or maybe I wrap it up with DTT. And DTT was not sufficient and wrap it up with glycerol and this and that. And while he was wrapping up his gentle elusive protease we were fractionating it. And I think the reason, and then we opened the gap of two to three years that he could never close any more. We came out, we poured papers to the literature at a pace of one every two months or every three months. So he just couldn’t keep. And he didn’t believe us as a matter of fact, which was good. He was the only serious contender or competitor at that time. And all the rest, Bob Shimki, they left the field. There were no real serious competitors at that time.
And I think that our luck compared to his was not, you can say we were better, I don’t know, I don’t like this, I don’t compare myself to anybody. I think that we were not preoccupied with any idea because we were not proteolysis people. We were in awe to the field. We never proteolysed the problem, we were never preoccupied with any idea about the system. We lost activity we said well maybe we split it into two, let’s take the two parts, put it together, wow, it worked. And then we took each factor and we took the other one and we further fractionated it and then we skin it again. It was like a puzzle. And at the time that I left the lab there were ten of fifteen E1, E2, E3 and some of them were unnamed. We knew that we knew them but we didn’t know what they are. So we were simple minded elegant biochemists, not occupied with any idea and I think that in this competition he lost, I think, because he was …";351;Creativity
Was it nice to be in that period of almost a decade of working fairly much alone or did you actually want more input after a while? Did you hope that more people would join you?;"Aaron Ciechanover: Retroactively I mean it was very nice. People told us you’ll lose your career but that’s minor. I mean you fail you do something again, maybe not important but unique, very nouvelle. So you don’t think of prizes, you don’t want to cure cancer, you think of what you do in the lab and it was nice. And it became complex and we discovered E1 and E2 and E3 and several histories and recognition of substrates. So we had a lot to do. So this was very interesting. I think that it’s very rare these days for such a system, I can compare it for example to SARNE which is a wonderful discovery and unbelievable. But it’s a system, it’s several enzymes that do what they do, /- – -/. We discovered I think, and again I don’t compare importance, don’t misunderstand me for a minute, I don’t say – there is nothing that is more or less important in biology, phosphorylation, but we discovered I think something, a huge iceberg. I mean that was still underneath.
And nobody could have predicted that this system, we discovered a system that has now almost 2,000 components, 1,500 components. It is involved everywhere and it’s not only in proteolysis. Ubiquitin like proteins say, routing of proteins to different subcellular destinations, to the nuclear por complex to the, from the cell membrane. And quality control, the whole quality control, /- – -/ the ubiquitin cell cycle and division, beautiful work of Tim Hunt, the cycle that goes up, it’s ubiquitin. I mean it’s only ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is everywhere and it’s not only for degradation. For me if I would have been asked a few years ago what’s ubiquitin, I would have said it’s a degradation signal. Now if somebody will ask me what’s ubiquitin I say it’s a passport. What’s a passport? Passport is a document that allows you to go to different countries. So if it ubiquitin certain way you go toward, you enter the country of the protozome. If ubiquitin another way you go to the world of the country of lysozome If ubiquitin /- – -/ you go to … it’s a very rich platform because you have several likes and many ubiquitin like proteins. So it’s very, it’s dynamic and it’s very flexible. You can use the same molecule to send different signals to different molecules to fulfil different functions.
So it’s first, now it’s extremely exciting to be there. I mean it’s, we are still competitive, we are doing very original work I believe in my lab. But it’s nice to know that you created a field, a humming field with 100,000 papers and laboratories and drug companies and thousands of researchers and conferences that you cannot even go any more. There are so many ubiquitin meetings, Cold Spring Harbour, Fasser, Embo, it’s endless, books, monographs, it’s a world of itself. But it’s rare, the fact that it was silent at the beginning basically let us lay down the entire system, not the system as we know it now, but the principles, conjugation, degradation … conjugation, recognition, degradation. And it’s an entirety. I mean we published 12 papers that are masterpieces that take you from A almost to Z. I mean the rest are as much as important as it is, genetics, the diseases, the drugs, are additional details that were added on it. But the core is in the paper. Now if people, you know, they’re RNA or let’s say reverse transcription, it’s an enzyme, that’s it. So it’s important but once you discover it that’s it, that’s the enzyme. Here it’s a huge thing that was hidden and I think that if people would have sensed that there is something important they would have jumped on it right there. So luckily they let us do it on our own and to really deploy and lay out the entire principles of the system, not the system. And that’s very nice.
So I think that retroactively looking at it I think that we were extremely lucky that people were sceptical so that we are in the, either in the back yard of the back quarters of biology or even worse, having an artefact people also said, well that’s just an artefact. And I remember we sent the first paper to, not the first paper, the first conjugation paper to sell and there’d been /- – -/ round it and he said that he will consider publishing it if we will tell him what’s 1, 2, 3, 4, all the steps. 1,2 3 protozome /- – -/ And then Irwin Rose who was our co-/- – -/ sent it to PA, just communicated, and in a few days it was in. And people simply didn’t believe us. And that allowed us to really lay out the entire system which I believe will not happen today any more. I mean if people will sense that something is important they’ll jump on it. So it’s our time. As I told you, from ’78, basically from ’76, but our first paper came in ’78, the next important paper on ubiquitin system came only in ’84, I’m with Alex Varshavsky, the two, we had a back to back sell paper, some of the first ubiquitin. So this was the next one. So you can imagine six successive years of silence in the field. Can you imagine these days this will happen? No way, no, absolutely no way.
But another, now that just comes to my mind about the disbelief, came I think from Marc Kirschner, well he believed us from the very beginning. But that work on cyclins and degradation of cell cyclin, Avram also joined the field later. And Marc told me that he always saw the high molecular way junk at the top of the gel but he looked only into cyclin. And he thought that this high molecular way is the real junk, I mean it’s garbage. ‘Schmutz’ as he called it, it’s a ‘German schmutz’. And then he realised that this was ubiquitin cyclin and it’s gold basically, the ultimate gold. So it took him years to just get it. So I think the attitude obviously changed, but I think the people left us alone for a wonderful period of silence that I really cherish in retrospect.";351;Career Devleopment
Do you still teach your students that the series of 12 papers? Do you make them go back through it?;"Aaron Ciechanover: Actually what we do when I teach advanced course, graduate course, the first two hours are reading plus my lecture about, not all the 12 of them, but the milestones among them. I think it is awfully important. And what I do more, which I’m going also tomorrow in my talk, I tell my students, and also tomorrow’s audience and every audience that I feel that I need to educate, that once you start a project it’s not you and me and I and me and I. What you do you look around you into the field and you see milestones. And then you try to connect them. You said what’s known now about proteolysis? Is the lysozyme /- – -/? What about energy? Who found that and who found that? Who cast now that it’s not the lysosome? And then you collect it.
And there are many people to which we should pay tribute. I mean we were not isolated. You don’t start a problem by just, you’re not floating in a vacuum. There was Bob Shimkin, Rudolph Shemheimer and Fred Goldberg and others that laid the ground that convinced us, yes, there is something that is still hidden, let’s find it. So I think that the beauty is the threads that leads from different milestones into a conclusion that ignites the process. I mean you don’t ignite a process without having a car that has a gas tank, wheels, steering wheel, whatever. It all feeds into one, into the final pushing the button. And in our case or in the case of new discovery it’s a button that has never been pushed but never the less this button is always fed by whatever your predecessors put before you.
And I think that’s very important because students today, maybe even me, I don’t remember myself, thinks that science is being born with them and will die with them and they start something completely new. And I think that it’s awfully important, not only to give credit because it’s morally right, but to give credit as a lesson of how to approach science and how to build on past knowledge. It’s critically important and I do it repeatedly day in and day out, go to papers from 1935 and 1940, we take the JBC out and we just telling the history repeatedly. Because there is so much into it.";351;Advice for young scientists
You alluded to the fact earlier that your PhD experience made you approach your post doc in a particularly different way. What was it that you took from the Hershko experience?;"Aaron Ciechanover: Well, when you go to a post doc and I remember coming to Harvey’s lab at MIT, and I consulted with Harvey. I wrote my post doc fellowship on something else. And then Harvey said, Harvey himself didn’t appreciate the ubiquitin system at that time and we are very good friends, and he said It’s very healthy that you’ll detach yourself from your past and start something new and then, from the ubiquitin whatever, do something else. Receptor /- – -/. And I started with it. It’s a matter of time. And I started, we did beautiful work on it that is classic now. It’s in Harvey’s text book of cell biology, cited a thousand times, on how the transferrin receptor releases iron into the cell transport – beautiful classic.
But then I became restless. I mean in a year into it, actually beforehand I became extremely restless and I said it must be stupid, I left behind such a beautiful system that is hardly the tip of the iceberg. I must go back. And luckily I had my own fellowship so I didn’t, you know, you feel more independent if somebody pays you out of his MIAge one. That’s one.
Second, Harvey is a terrific mentor. I mean he’s so liberal and so open and he’s not imposing. And he doesn’t care that people will do their own, I mean that’s very unique. And I said to him I want to go back to the ubiquitin system. He said Okay but keep a little bit on small fire what you did now because it’s so beautiful. All right, I flipped around day and night, whatever, weekends. And I went back to the ubiquitin system and then collaborated with Alex Varshavsky and he came with his ideas about, that was his entry to the field, and he came with wonderful ideas. But I worked on my own also. I published on my own as a post doc on the ubiquitin system, on the recognition motifs that later turned out to be part of the N-end rule that Alex worked but we needed biochemically, it doesn’t matter.";351;Creativity
In general, how does Israeli science fare these days? What challenges does Israeli science face?;"Aaron Ciechanover: I think that we are doing quite well. I mean we are a small country of six, seven million people with leading universities, the Weizmann Institute that you all know and you can point out to achievements. Let’s leave alone the ubiquitin system. Drug development, multiple sclerosis, Copaxon that came from the Weizmann Institute, Alzheimer drug, very successful and it came from. You can go not only to biology. You can go to the condensation of information that led later on to the development of the fax and computers and so on. It’s the Lempel-Ziv algorithm, something that was never patented but it came from the Technion. So Israel is very, you know we are exporting $20 billion a year of high tech. We don’t export oil, we are not Saudi Arabia, we don’t have one drop of our own oil. So all that we export.
Initially we were a farm land, we exported oranges. And now we export knowledge. And it’s all a result of our educational system. The future I cannot tell you. I am a little bit more pessimistic. So to be realistic I am a little bit more pessimistic because the government cut some high education. Maybe they say we are successful and there are other needs and we are succumbing also to political settlements. Again I’m not expressing my opinion for or against but I say that different religious parties, I mean they are different sources, different channels to which the budget goes that should or shouldn’t go doesn’t matter, but never the less you are using budget for that. And the government is not that supportive as it should be in my opinion of high education. Also the very best scientists, we are still absorbed, we recruit the best scientists back. But some are already raising doubts whether they want to leave there because of the security, because of economy and so on and so forth. I think that we are doing good. We are okay now. I cannot predict for the future.
I mean there is a brain drain for different reasons, mostly, I don’t know if mostly, but security is clearly one of them. The instability in the area. Just a year ago we were bombarded with Hizbollah missiles. So I think that there is a place for concern about the future of science in Israel. But I think that learning and scholarly has always been a Jewish trait and in that sense I think I am not concerned, it will continue. Whether it will be in Israel I hope so and I will support it with all my power and spirit. I was born in this country and will die there, there is no doubt about it and will live the rest of my life in this place. Because for me it’s more than a country, it’s much more than a country and a place of living.";351;Motivation
The Nobel Prize has many effects on many people, but what in particular has it done for you?;"Aaron Ciechanover: Well, it had the same many effects like on many other people. It keeps me busy travelling all over the world. But I think that there is something that is, I don’t know if maybe unique to me, and the fact that I’m Jewish and Israel. And it opened the door for me to Jewish communities all over the world. And there are Jewish communities which are very diverse. I mean there are very rich Jewish communities and affluent and well to do in the United States. But on the other hand there are very small Jewish communities that you know cling to the walls and hardly survive, and never the less want to remain as they are. In Athens in Greece; Greece had half a million Jews, they were all exterminated in the holocaust. Now there are less than 5,000. Peru, 3,000. Paraguay, Ecuador, Uruguay. And there are two things about it that made me so excited about it. And the issue is extremely important to me. As we talk Israel is my country, it’s not Israel as a nation, it’s the Jewish state, and the country was born after the holocaust in Europe because during the holocaust Jews were persecuted and murdered in Europe. So the timing of the establishment of the state of Israel is not just a random date. It’s a very particular date, ’47 and so on. And so the whole thing is very important for me. And I come to these Jewish – and I’ll tell you in a minute a story that is really important – I come to these Jewish communities and you see that you blow an unbelievable wind in themselves, you fill them with pride. There are many Jews who won Nobel Prizes, let’s don’t analyse numbers and reasons for it, it’s a unique phenomenon by itself. But an Israeli that speaks Hebrew, that’s served in the battle field, that was born in the year that the country was born, ’47, for them it’s something else.
And you see the cheerfulness, the joyfulness, the pride. I mean for me I feel like an ambassador of not only of my own country, without being an ambassador, and you see how important it is to them. And let me just end up with again one Jewish note. It was Saturday afternoon, I was invited to a meeting in Tomar, Portugal. It is a city 120 kilometres north-east of Lisbon. And I had to give a key note in a stress meeting, protein stress. It was the International Heat Check Society. And we drove from north of Spain we drove into Portugal, we arrived early and my son was with me. And we walked in the city, the city of Tomar, and we walked in the city and it’s a typically open city you know, the big square, the church, the city hall. And all of a sudden we see a small note saying synagogue, a small sign said synagogue. I said synagogue, let’s go and see the synagogue. So we start to crawl in back alleys and we get to the synagogue. And the synagogue is a very small room and nicely refurbished but completely erratic in its furniture. So you see that the chairs were brought from homes and on the walls there was some posters of El-Al which is Israel Airlines, with pictures of Jerusalem. But the walls were very nicely re-done.
And we looked around and we said yes and we read some sign about the history of the place. And the history was very interesting. It was established in 1430s and was closed sixty years later in the 1490s by a decree of King Emanuel I, the King of Portugal that married the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabel of Spain, and the condition for the marriage was obviously the enforcement of the inquisition laws in Portugal. And the Jews were forced to either leave the country or convert. And the synagogue was closed. And for 500 years it was offices, prison, whatever, belonged to the government. And in ’75, 1975, 500 years later it was re-opened once Salazar the dictator of Portugal was deposed and Portugal became democracy a few years after Spain. For 500 years these Jews that were converted became Iramos, they became crypted Jews, so they lived as Jews under the ground. To the eyes of the neighbours they were Christians. They went to the church, whatever. But at home in the most hidden way they kept a thin thread of Judaism.
So they didn’t keep it in full. They didn’t marry, they didn’t keep their Saturday, whatever, they just you know on Friday night they lighted the candles but they didn’t say any blessing. And it went from mother to daughter to son. I mean they never were told that they were Jews or anything. On Passover they did some residual ceremony and that’s it. No books, no nothing. And they kept their Judaism hidden. And all of a sudden in 1975 they floated up again and they became ultra-Orthodox Jews. Now the synagogue, we came to the synagogue and we read the history and they said it was closed because of this and that, and then we signed our name in the guest book. And the guy who was the guard of the synagogue saw that we were writing in Hebrew and we said We bless you for opening the synagogue. He said Are you from Israel? We said Yes we are from Israel. So all of a sudden we became … so he said to us I want to tell my story and his story is indeed the story.
He belonged to a Catholic family for 500 years, he grew up as Catholic, and in 1975 he’s 75 years old, all of a sudden he was converted to Judaism and became an ultra-Orthodox Jew. There are only two families in the city that were left, he and his friend, old friend, and they were appointed by the Portuguese government to guard the synagogue. And the Portuguese government takes very good care of them now because they want to revive Jewish life or at least the rich Jewish history. That’s just the beginning of the story but I’ll end it up with two very shortly and you’ll see how exciting and then you’ll understand why I’m so … So he said to me, You know it’s Saturday, why won’t you come tomorrow afternoon to the synagogue. I said You know Jews pray on Saturday, why should I come on Sunday? Sunday belongs as far as I can remember to the Christians, they go to church. He said, so he said to me There will be ceremony tomorrow afternoon, a ceremonial prayer in the synagogue. I said Ceremonial prayer in the synagogue, why on Sunday? He said You know tomorrow the first ever Israeli scientist that won a Nobel Prize is going to be our guest.
Wow! I said to him and I looked at my son and, you know, typically you come to these conferences and you are so busy, they load you with your schedule and you never look at it. And get up in the morning and my wife will say what shall we do? I said don’t worry, people will take us around, just don’t worry. We have a plan, let’s don’t worry about it. So it was on my schedule that I have to be in the synagogue for some ceremonial prayer and I didn’t look at it. So I look at my son and I said to the guy I suspect that you’re talking on me. And he couldn’t believe it. He just couldn’t believe it. And there was a silence in the room for a minute and then he fell on my shoulder with tears. And you know it was an unbelievable moment. We were the three of us alone in the synagogue, him, my son and myself, and for him it was the ultimate Jewish experience. I mean that here for the first time, you know, there are no Jews to pray there. You know they’re going to pray ceremonially celebrating the victory of science, whatever, with an Israeli Nobel Laureate and for him he was waiting for this ceremony. And all of a sudden somebody walks from the street, just at random, and we started to talk. So for him it was such an intimate moment. And me myself I broke in tears. And then the next day we came, the Israeli ambassador, I mean it was a very nice prayer, they kind of, Jews came, cryptic Jews came from all the villages around because the whole area was scattered with them, there was a huge Jewish community in Portugal at that time. And we celebrated but this moment on Saturday afternoon I understood to the tiniest last smallest detail what I mean for these Jews. I mean it’s unbelievable. And I said If I’m going ever to live in the state of Israel, it’s for him. So I mean that’s the Nobel Prize because without the Nobel Prize it would never have occurred, I would never have been invited. So the Nobel people don’t know about it at all what they did to my country, to me, to the Jewish community, it’s unbelievable experience.";351;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How come you left medicine?;Avram Hershko: Well, I started out as a medical student, I wanted to be a doctor. And during my medical studies I studied biochemistry. That was one of the subjects that every medical student studies, so I liked it very much. I liked, you know, the whole concept of biochemistry, of looking for chemical processes in cells, so we had, we could take off one year from the studies to spend in research in the lab. I also found a very good teacher, Jacob Mager, and I wanted to spend it with him, so I did. That’s how I got involved in biochemistry. Afterwards, I finished my medical studies but already, I, after that one year, I knew that I will go to biochemistry and not to practical medicine. That’s how I started. So, it’s, it’s, like all things in life, it starts by some kind of accident or so, that was the accident, I met a subject during my studies that I liked.;352;Motivation
Was it also a topic, an issue that you were interested in?;Avram Hershko: No, no, not yet, not yet. Mager was interested in many subjects so that was … Actually, I continued with him after my army service as a doctor, and during the course of a couple of years I evolved in four completely different subjects, protein, synthesis, purine metabolism, and a certain disease called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, because he was interested in many things, so that gave me a very good background, a very, very, you know, very good basic background.;352;Motivation
How did you meet together?;"Avram Hershko: Well, that’s another story. I got interested in protein degradation during my post-doc fellowship in San Francisco, and when I came back to Israel I continued with that, and at that time it was a very obscure field, you know. People, there were all kinds of, not too many people were interested in it. Those that were interested were not very good. So I looked for somebody, and so my first time I think I came up and I looked for somebody to spend a sabbatical with. I couldn’t find anybody that attracted me. So then I met Ernie at a meeting in 1976, one year before, before my sabbatical was due. And do you remember, we met in the breakfast, so I said can I, just began to talk …
Irwin Rose: It’s alright, I forgot.
Avram Hershko: … breakfast table, so I knew who he was, he was very well known for his work on enzyme mechanism. That I knew, but then I asked him what are you interested in, in other things? So it turned out that he was interested in protein degradation. And that was a secret, it was a secret because he never published anything on it, and I asked him how come you never published anything, and so he said there is nothing worth publishing on protein degradation. So that’s what he said.
Irwin Rose: Yeah, that was my opinion. Well, because I hadn’t done anything, you don’t say it right.
Avram Hershko: OK. Well, that’s how I remember it. And anyhow, I liked that attitude very much, and asked, I asked him can I spend my sabbatical with you? And he said yes, so that’s how it started, and then Aaron, the same year he started his PhD with me, and after my sabbatical the following, the summer after my sabbatical, Aaron joined us, and then he joined us for a couple of summers afterwards, so that’s how, that’s how the whole connection started.";352;Creativity
But how come you pick up an obscure field in science, to work on?;"Irwin Rose: Well, I’ll tell you, because when I first worked at Yale, the guy who had a lab next to me had made the original observation that there was a protein, there was an energy dependent on protein breakdown. Now, nobody believed him, but he had made some pretty strong observations that if you …
Avram Hershko: Here, we could mention names.
Irwin Rose: Yes, Melvin Simpson. He made these important observations.
Aaron Ciechanover: He hardly believed himself, because when you go into discussion on the paper, you kind of come to a convoluted argument whether it’s a direct requirement or indirect. We can do the conclusion that it’s indirect.";352;Motivation
You do nothing? Who is the worker?;"Avram Hershko: Well, that’s, first of all, that’s not true. I remember that you made some ubiquitin preparation …
Irwin Rose: I did.
Avram Hershko: Yes, and it fell on the floor, and then you collected it up from the floor … yeah, yeah. That first step is to boil the extra, because ubiquitin is heat stable, so you boiled it but then it fell on the floor, but you picked it up and it was good, yeah.
Irwin Rose: It was good, nothing could destroy it.
Irwin Rose: It was a licence only enzyme.
Aaron Ciechanover: The /- – -/ can take it, but not the floor.
Avram Hershko: But, yeah, but when I came to his lab we already had his first step, which was the fractionation, well, the reticulocyte cell-free system system was actually established in the laboratory of somebody else, Alfred Goldberg in Harvard, but they didn’t …
Aaron Ciechanover: /Inaudible./
Avram Hershko: No, no, but, yeah, but he made it first, he made it first.
Aaron Ciechanover: The first publication was from Harvard, no doubt.
Avram Hershko: But then he didn’t progress, but then he didn’t do what he should have done, which is fractionation. It’s hard to purify right away, but ATP dependent enzyme, he never found it. And what we did was fractionation and constitution, so we already had this first step of separating it into two, two fractions, fraction one and fraction two.
So during these two years between the beginning of ’77 when I write to your lab and December of ’79, when we made the breakthrough in your lab, we purified the component from fraction one, we found it a heat stable protein, and then you had a part in that, you also boiled ubiquitin, and then in Haifa we found that it gets … when we labelled it with iodine and we found it gets bound to proteins and ATP dependent reaction, but we didn’t really understand that it’s binding, its co-herent binding the substate until that summer in 1971 in the laboratory of Rose where you invited me, together with Aaron who was then my graduate student in /- – -/ who was there. 1979, 1979. So that is when, when the discovery that ubiquitin …
Irwin Rose: Shall I tell the story about the ubiquitin?
Avram Hershko: Yes. I think I have finished. So then, that’s how I remember it, and how …
Irwin Rose: OK, well, here they had a heat stable factor that was required, and they made the observation that the ubiquitin went on to proteins. And so one of my post docs went to a post doc of another student, of another faculty member at the Fox Chase Cancer Centre, and said, there was a conversation, and do you know of any examples of a protein covalently linked to a protein? And this post doctoral fellow said yes, there is in the nucleus, a protein called ubiquitin that’s covalently linked to histone. And so they rushed to look at the amino acid composition of that so-called ubiquitin, and they compared it to the amino acid composition which you had published, I guess …
Aaron Ciechanover: No, not yet.
Irwin Rose: Not yet published.
Aaron Ciechanover: But in the end it was published back to back with JBC.
Irwin Rose: No, no, no. But how did they know the conversation …
Aaron Ciechanover: No, because they knew, the end story is that the Wilkinson paper came back to back with ours on the /- – -/.
Avram Hershko: OK. Let’s not go into the detail.
Irwin Rose: Well, for some reason or other, they found confidence…
Avram Hershko: They knew that I published that.
Irwin Rose: Really, and I was not a leak.
Avram Hershko: No, no, you were not.
Aaron Ciechanover: No, he was in the lab, he was free and did this. We didn’t hide anything.
Irwin Rose: OK, you’re getting the inside story here. Now, wait a second.";352;Creativity
So do you think you would get support today for such work, which was kind of apart?;Avram Hershko: Well, I hope the fund /- – -/ look up your website and will hear these things. Because it’s … yeah, Joe Goldstein, you know, a Nobel Laureate and a good one, wrote a nice article about this year’s Lasker Award, in which he compared science to a sculpture by this British sculptor who had his stone, it was a huge stone of two and a half ton, on which another stone, and another stone, and another stone, and at the end is a little stone, so he said that in science there are big stones and small stones. The important science is the opposite. When you have a little stone, and on top of it you put a bigger stone and then a bigger stone. If you throw out a big stone at the beginning so there’s a lot of publicity sometimes nothing comes out of it, and the scientist, to find his little stone, on which the other stones can be built. So I recommend to read his article.;352;Creativity
Do you compete with each other?;"Avram Hershko: No, there is enough to do in the ubiquitin field, we don’t feel that we had to compete. There are different aspects of the ubiquitin field. I am working on cell cycle and he works on …
Aaron Ciechanover: /- – -/. Completely different.";352;Creativity
How is it to live in a small country with big problems and to get funds for science?;Avram Hershko: It is not easy, it is not easy. You have to know the daily tension which is of course distractive. The funds are small, some funds for science are small. Graduate students have to go to serve in the army and things like that, so it’s more difficult than elsewhere, but it’s possible, it’s possible.;352;Environment
How did you meet together?;"Avram Hershko: Well, that’s another story. I got interested in protein degradation during my post-doc fellowship in San Francisco, and when I came back to Israel I continued with that, and at that time it was a very obscure field, you know. People, there were all kinds of, not too many people were interested in it. Those that were interested were not very good. So I looked for somebody, and so my first time I think I came up and I looked for somebody to spend a sabbatical with. I couldn’t find anybody that attracted me. So then I met Ernie at a meeting in 1976, one year before, before my sabbatical was due. And do you remember, we met in the breakfast, so I said can I, just began to talk …
Irwin Rose: It’s alright, I forgot.
Avram Hershko: … breakfast table, so I knew who he was, he was very well known for his work on enzyme mechanism. That I knew, but then I asked him what are you interested in, in other things? So it turned out that he was interested in protein degradation. And that was a secret, it was a secret because he never published anything on it, and I asked him how come you never published anything, and so he said there is nothing worth publishing on protein degradation. So that’s what he said.
Irwin Rose: Yeah, that was my opinion. Well, because I hadn’t done anything, you don’t say it right.
Avram Hershko: OK. Well, that’s how I remember it. And anyhow, I liked that attitude very much, and asked, I asked him can I spend my sabbatical with you? And he said yes, so that’s how it started, and then Aaron, the same year he started his PhD with me, and after my sabbatical the following, the summer after my sabbatical, Aaron joined us, and then he joined us for a couple of summers afterwards, so that’s how, that’s how the whole connection started.";353;Creativity
But how come you pick up an obscure field in science, to work on?;"Irwin Rose: Well, I’ll tell you, because when I first worked at Yale, the guy who had a lab next to me had made the original observation that there was a protein, there was an energy dependent on protein breakdown. Now, nobody believed him, but he had made some pretty strong observations that if you …
Avram Hershko: Here, we could mention names.
Irwin Rose: Yes, Melvin Simpson. He made these important observations.
Aaron Ciechanover: He hardly believed himself, because when you go into discussion on the paper, you kind of come to a convoluted argument whether it’s a direct requirement or indirect. We can do the conclusion that it’s indirect.";353;Motivation
You do nothing? Who is the worker?;"Avram Hershko: Well, that’s, first of all, that’s not true. I remember that you made some ubiquitin preparation …
Irwin Rose: I did.
Avram Hershko: Yes, and it fell on the floor, and then you collected it up from the floor … yeah, yeah. That first step is to boil the extra, because ubiquitin is heat stable, so you boiled it but then it fell on the floor, but you picked it up and it was good, yeah.
Irwin Rose: It was good, nothing could destroy it.
Irwin Rose: It was a licence only enzyme.
Aaron Ciechanover: The /- – -/ can take it, but not the floor.
Avram Hershko: But, yeah, but when I came to his lab we already had his first step, which was the fractionation, well, the reticulocyte cell-free system system was actually established in the laboratory of somebody else, Alfred Goldberg in Harvard, but they didn’t …
Aaron Ciechanover: /Inaudible./
Avram Hershko: No, no, but, yeah, but he made it first, he made it first.
Aaron Ciechanover: The first publication was from Harvard, no doubt.

How do you survive as a scientist when nobody believes you somehow?;"Irwin Rose: You’re making observations, and the observations get published, so the observations are true. Whether anybody will say that belongs to a big story like it turns out to be is not predictable, but so you don’t make claims like that. You say that this is very interesting and so on and so on and so on, and you keep following it up, and it doesn’t necessarily become the centre of attention yet, until you build a big enough story. I think that’s the way it works.
We all survive because funding for research was generous in those days, you know. It’s been less generous now, and we have a peer review system which is more critical and so I think you have to, you have to add successively to the picture you’re trying to portray. It’s not sufficient to just provide data. So I think that’s part of it. But I agree that it’s important to be left alone for a sufficient amount of time in order to be able to do it, and not feel that you’re in the middle of a big activity already, so you know, you need to do that sort of thing.";353;Environment
So are you the kind of scientists that work all day and all night long, kind of nerd scientists?;"Irwin Rose: I think we all work all day and all night long. I do. I don’t have any hobbies, you know, I’m very embarrassed when people ask me what are my hobbies, I don’t have any hobbies. I mean, it’s just enough to keep up with the things I’m trying to solve. You know, I used to work on little puzzles and so on and so forth. Each puzzle requires attention and, so you get an idea. You get your ideas at different times. Sometimes your wife makes a statement and you say: aha, maybe you’re right. And so you go off to your kitchen, and do a little experiment, so you try to, that’s the way you make progress, if you continue these things. So that’s my recommendation, do not retire. Do not retire fellas.
Avram Hershko: I won’t.
Aaron Ciechanover: I’m never going to.";353;Creativity
What would you say about this styles of doing science?;"Peter Agre: Well there are different styles and there are different types of discoveries. There is an incremental advance in an area. It’s been said that hypothesis has driven research is greatly overrated. I think Al Gilman said that. But you have to have a hypothesis in order to go to work. We don’t just randomly do things. Rod said a random walk with a purpose. But that’s where science stops engineering, because the engineer has a goal. He has to build the bridge at this location. He’s not out there to look for landscaping or for archaeological sites. He has a goal. And that must be achieved. But in science we purposely pursue goals. We have meaningful objectives we want to achieve. But the discoveries sometimes discover us.
The unforeseen like Rod says talk to your experiments or let your experiments talk to you because you can force things out and that’s usually predictable science. But the big breaks in sciences have always been the unpredictable events. And Alexander Fleming had a Petri dish that was uncovered and a mould happened to land on it and killed the bacteria. That was an unpredicted event. That was a big discovery.";354;Advice  for young scientists
What about aquaporins, your discovery?;Peter Agre: In our case I consider the aquaporins was what I consider a real discovery because we were doing I thought very knowledgeable and a logical approach to studying the human RH blood group antigen and red cells. I’m a blood specialist in my earlier career. And we found something that didn’t fit and it turned out to be unrelated and had some curious properties. And we were given enough free time – the demands at being an administrator at that point in my career was smaller – and we let the experiments talk to us. It was extremely abundant red cells. No one had ever seen it before. Wasn’t supposed to be there. And I like to tell people it’s like driving in a remote area of Northern Sweden and you come across a city of 200 thousand people that’s not on the map. It gets your attention. And so this was the discovery. Then we figured it out. But it was not part of my life plan. It’s probably much better than it would have been if I had a life plan.;354;Creativity
What would you say about the relation between science and society?;"Peter Agre: I think science owes a lot to society but society owes a lot to science. To be a scientist we’re doing research activities in laboratories that are very expensive. To have staff, time in the synchrotron, laboratory space in New York City you know we’re talking about enormous amounts of money but society chooses to do that. The poor countries in the world have no choice. They cannot pursue discovery level science in poor countries. And the people from those poor countries who are creative and inquisitive end up leaving and coming to place like Sweden, Western Europe, the United States. We happen to be lucky in that we were born in the US where all these things were made available by society. The taxpayers’ dollars. But in return we need to be thinking of things that are not only fun for us to do. That’s where Huckleberry Finn ends. Things that are actually good for people. You don’t always know immediately what will be good or how good it will be.
Two of my professors when I was a medical student, Dan Nathans at Hammersmith won the Nobel Prize 25 years ago this week for the discovery of the restriction enzymes. The enzymes that cut DNA which permitted this whole revolution in biology to occur. But when they first discovered it was a bacterial protein that cut up some viral DNA samples. It seemed very basic. They used it practically and in a limited manner. And they knew they would be important. But they weren’t running off saying this will lead to breakthroughs in cancer, and gene therapy which of course they have. So I think we need to provide things to society that are worth wile. But I don’t think we should worry minute by minute how will the structure of the potassium channel lead to an improved society or will the water channel proteins be immediately useful. There are many discoveries that are very important for which we still haven’t been able to use it too well. I think an example that I share with the medical students is the discovery of sickle cell haemoglobin by Linus Pauling in 1949. Fundamental advance. We could understand what causes this horrible disease but we still can’t treat it well.";354;Creativity
Do you think that scientists should be kept responsible for the applications of their results?;"Peter Agre: Responsible in the sense that they have a mission that they need to convey. And I suspect one of the reasons that Rod and I are here in Stockholm this week is not to pat ourselves on the back for being good scientists and making important things but to share the love of science and to encourage young scientists. Frankly in terms of my work in the water channel proteins, the aquaporins, I think what we’ve done is the easy work. We’ve discovered something that most people didn’t believe. We know they’re important, but how can we use that? How can we apply that to improve the lives of people? To improve the agricultural output for countries where people are living in hunger. I can’t take full responsibility for that. I do take responsibility for sharing the level of this and exciting the young people and challenging them to step up. They’re the ones who are going to do the next level of research. They’re the future of science.
Roderick MacKinnon: I agree and I would say that scientists have to act responsibly in the way they do science. In other words not be doing experiments that are of immediate obvious danger to themselves or people around them. But at the same time I wouldn’t say that scientists before doing experiments should try to think ahead of all the possible applications to decide whether or not they should do that experiment. I think the reason for that is that none of us are smart enough to think that far ahead. We can all think of examples of things, discoveries that have been used for very good purposes and for very bad purposes. I think scientists shouldn’t be making this decision before they do experiments. We should be curious and trying to discover the world around us and responsible in the way that it would be very special if we can point some of our work in some way to application. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? After all it would be fantastic to be able to help people.
Peter Agre: I think often times others will see the usefulness of the discoveries we’ve made and designing inhibitors of ion channels. It’s probably not something that will come from your lab.
Roderick MacKinnon: Probably not.
Peter Agre: But they’re going to be following the information that you’ve discovered and the coordinates that you’ve established and in that way I guess we do contribute to the next step. We have to report accurately what’s there. I think at this point a lot of what we should be doing is exciting others that this is important.
Roderick MacKinnon: I couldn’t agree more.";354;Roles of Science
If you could dream about the application of aquaporins for example, what would this be?;Peter Agre: There are a lot of things I would dream for. If I had to pick one I would hope that the aquaporins present in the malaria organisation would be useful drug targets because this is a horrible disease, malaria. Three million children die every year in Africa of malaria. And the current drugs are no longer so useful. Not that they’re expensive but the organism is becoming resistant. We need new ideas. That’s one thing that I could dream of I would dream for that.;354;Meaning (Values) of Work
I know that you’re engaged in social and political activities outside science. Can you tell us what you’re going to do with part of your Nobel Prize money?;Peter Agre: They asked me that the morning of the announcements and I have been involved in some human rights activities. This is not a major issue in terms that I’ve quit my day job, but I have been very concerned. There is a community in the National Academy of Sciences of Human Rights which I’ve participated in. Torsten Wiesel, originally here from Sweden is the Chair of that. In particular I have been very active in the case of Thomas C. Butler, an American scientist who’s facing life in prison from having lost some samples from his laboratory and consequences of that which I feel our government has unfairly presented and manipulated. Butler by the way has strong Swedish roots. His wife Elizabeth is a Stockholm university graduate. He himself was a sabbatical worker at Karolinska and I knew him as a student. He’s a very fine person. It’s impossible not to become active in that. We’re supporting his legal defence fund as much as we can and we hope others will as well.;354;How to Spend the Nobel money
It sounds wonderful. How do you keep such a heterogenic group together?;"Peter Agre: Well that’s the interesting thing it just happens. The best people you’re not trying to track them down and drag them to the labs, they actually want to come and work in the laboratories. They apply. They ask is it possible I can work in your laboratory. I can’t imagine more flattery than that.
Roderick MacKinnon: It’s true. I have somewhat of a system where when somebody applies if things look right and they seem enthusiastic in their application I then invite them to the lab for a day. I talk to them. Just talk about science. And then they give a little talk to the lab. Then they go around and talk to everybody in the lab who tells them all about their projects so they can learn about the lab and then we go out to dinner as a big group and we all have a big dinner at some restaurant in New York. Then they stay over. Then we say goodbye and they leave the next day. We get together and say what do you think?";354;Advice for young scientists
What about the competition within this group?;"Roderick MacKinnon: You have to make sure people are not working on the same thing. At least if things are related they know what their boundaries and what is theirs because people will do the best work if they feel they’re doing this as part of them. They want to make it beautiful. So you have to make that clear that people know what is coming from their mind and from their efforts.
Peter Agre: I think competition within the group is a big problem in some labs. Avoiding that is essential. I think when the young people enjoy each other they help each other a lot. Just like brothers and sisters will help each other. The parents are there. They set out the guidelines. But I learned a lot of things from my brother growing up but my father and my mother really weren’t concerned about. Couldn’t advise me. The teams are like that. If there is a sibling rivalry that can be disruptive. I don’t think you see that in the better labs.
Roderick MacKinnon: But if you keep objectives, even if they’re related, if you keep the main objectives separate in what people want to pursue. If two people come in and say they want to work on the exact same thing you say no. If somebody came to me and said I want to work on this but somebody is working on it I would say that’s a very good idea but you know somebody in my lab is working on that. And you can talk to them about it. And anybody who wouldn’t understand that you wouldn’t want to be working with anyway. And so what happens in terms of when somebody’s project really starts to work. It’s taking off. For example they finally get to diffract the crystals and getting a structure everyone else in the lab gets so excited. It revs them up. They’re excited for that person and they’re also more energised about their own project. It just happens.";354;Creativity
Welcome to the Nobel E-Museum and also to this interview, Professor Peter Agre and Roderick MacKinnon. I would like to congratulate you to the Nobel Prize. It’s a prize of the scientific community to the most prominent scientists in the community, I would say. And I would like you to tell us: What is it like to be a scientist? Professor MacKinnon?;"Roderick MacKinnon: I always say to my students that being a scientist is like being an explorer and I really mean that, because in a sense I think in science we explore the world, the universe around us. Some people look at big things and other people look at very small things, but in a sense we’re all trying to understand the world around us. In a sense we’re looking in little corners and places that nobody has ever looked before. And that’s a lot of fun. We go to work and we have problems that we’re interested in.
And when I say we, from my kind of work, I run a laboratory and that means there are people who have come to the laboratory to work with me because they’re interested in the same problems. It’s like a family, if you will, interested in problems. And we get excited about things and we figure out how to do experiments to test them.";355;How to spend the Nobel Prize money
How do you make a discovery actually?;Roderick MacKinnon: I think different discoveries happen in different ways. A lot of them happen because, you know, most of them … It’s a good question because a lot of times, at the end of something when we’ve finally shown something, like there is a beautiful structure here that does a certain thing and people look at it and say Oh that’s very beautiful. Have you thought of this, and it led to this … but often times actually what happens is you have this idea and you start to pursue it. It’s in an area. And then you think you know how something works, so you do tests. And actually you find out what you thought was wrong.;355;Creativity

What was it, maybe back in your childhood, that made you interested in science in specific?;John B. Fenn: Well my father was an electrical engineer and he was a very ingenious and handy fellow, he did lots of things. I had a brother who was three years younger and when I was about eight or something like that my parents bought The Book Of Knowledge which is a children’s encyclopaedia, 20 volumes or so. And I just was reading that all the time. I think I was educated by my experience of reading The Book Of Knowledge. And I know years later, when I dug it out to give to the next door neighbour’s children to look at, those books were pretty well worn and I must have spent an awful lot of time on it. So I have always been interested in science and things technical. And my dad subscribed to the Popular Science Monthly and Popular Mechanics and so I was exposed to technology and science all along and I just liked it.;356;Creativity
So did you life change a lot after that?;John B. Fenn: Oh God yes. The telephone did not stop ringing for the next month it seemed like. And we are a publicity conscious society, you know, you get your name in the papers and then everybody wants you to do this that and other things. And so you get invitations to everywhere. I think I told you I was away from home 100 nights in the first year after I got it.;356;Impact of Nobel prize on you
When you now get to talk to students what kind of message would you like to relay to them?;John B. Fenn: Forget about your text books, science is fun! The text books are terrible.;356;Advice for young researchers
In which fields do you believe that there will be major breakthroughs in the future? What are the most important issues?;"ohn B. Fenn: Of course there are all kinds of technological problems that are important. I mean, what are we going to do about the warming of the atmosphere? We understand what causes it but we are too bloody stupid to do what is necessary to stop it. The idea that everybody has to have a car and that there is no speed limit and they make these SUV’s. It takes 20 times as much fuel to haul a tonne of freight a mile in a truck as it does in a train.
And yet we subsidise the trucking industry by building these roads which they don’t pay for and even they don’t pay for the damage they do to them because the damage to the road by traffic goes up with the cube of the mass of the traffic. So a truck does a tremendous amount more damage to a highway than a car does. And we should put a tax on the fuel so that the trucks will be on a par with the trains. Because the railroads have to maintain the road. Our politics are all crazy. Too many special interests are controlling what is done and it is not in the best interest of the people.";356;Future research
Can you already tell us how the prize has changed your life? What are the advantages of the prize?;Koichi Tanaka: Yes. My life is completely changed and so, as you may know, I am unfortunately too popular in Japan, so I’m actually chased by many press people, even in Sweden – so, completely changed. I actually want to go back to my normal life, it means previous life, before I received the prize, but maybe it is very good for me, because I’m in a kind of research job, so if I want to do some latest research job, I have to contact as many people as possible. Now, my name is very popular in Japan, even in foreign countries so, if I want to know something I didn’t know, I can contact such people and I can communicate each other. That will be very good in near future, but at this moment too busy so I have no time to do such job.;357;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What is your main interest now or in the nearest future, at work?;Koichi Tanaka: My present job is trying to understand the structure of protein but in a near future, that kind of research will be ended so all the information will be reviewed. Protein information will be reviewed maybe within several years or five years later. After that, the next target will be probably sugar, we call it polymer saccharide, because we’re constructed by protein, sugar, fat and of course water and if after we know the protein information, the next target will be other compounds like sugar and lipid, fat. My next target is to try to review what kind of compound we are made of, so sugar and lipid. That’s my next target.;357;Future research
So you are heading for the next invention and next Nobel Prize maybe?;Koichi Tanaka: Because I’m trying to develop some kind of instrument that will be very useful for such research, but at this moment we developed an instrument but that is just a tool, so we have to develop some other technique which will make the best use of such a tool so I am actually trying to contact … even before receiving this prize, I aspired to contact such people, so now it’s probably very easy for me to contact such people.;357;Future research
What is your experience of working with such revolutionary invention, I would say?;Koichi Tanaka: In 1980s, you’re talking about 1980s, our group consisting of five people, including me, are trying to develop all the system, so that is called mass spectrometer, so try to know the size or weight more accurate, and I was trying to develop the … how to say, ionisation, so try to make such compound which charge, so after that such kind of compound will be separated by something and detected and measured, so I try to make such compound ionisation, so at that time, for example protein, was thought it was impossible to ionise such big size more accurate but fortunately I was not a specialist.;357;Creativity
What do you think is the difference to work for a company?;Koichi Tanaka: So yes, so normally the researcher in company has some limitation because such people are forced to develop something that will be useful just for next year, so just very short-term development. In such case, we have to do something easy to do within a short time. On the other hand, researchers, for example in government institute or university can concentrate, and do such research maybe three years or five years, but in my case, at that time, in 1980s, I can do such similar job like university and the money was not a problem, not limitless, but we can spend some big money at that time.;357;Environment
Time was not problem either?;Koichi Tanaka: No, no problem, so that is the one biggest merit for me to discover such a new thing and one merit for the company. If the company thought that is not useful for developing new machine which will be sought in near future, such kind of activity will be halted and sometime it will be completely forgotten, but fortunately, my boss thought this is a very new technique and will be useful in the near future. His opinion was like that, so we are lucky to continue that development, but most of the projects in the companies will be controlled by such decisions so there are so many lucky and me, so at first money was not a problem and we can do some long term development and we can launch such a machine. So many things help me to show such results or discovery to, at first Japan and finally, such kind of information was transferred to Europe and America by several people, so I have to say thank you to so many people here.;357;Creativity
How did you get accustomed to being interviewed in public over time?;Koichi Tanaka: Probably up to university student, I was a completely shy guy and if I, for example, even in Japan, I had to give some talk in front of, for example 100 people, I would be completely upset and I couldn’t say anything, just ahh. But fortunately, my colleague at that time tried to teach me how to cope with such stress, so at first just try to say something in front of the colleagues and I did and so next step is to say something in front of my employees in my company, so next step is try to give a talk to the people in the conference. So, step by step I learn how to do in front of bigger and bigger number of people, so now I’m here.;357;Creativity
How did you start in this field?;Kurt Wüthrich: I started in the field of magnetic resonance spectroscopy when I was 22 years old.;358;Creativity
You are in the field of proteomics, which is a very new field in science?;Kurt Wüthrich: We have been working with proteins. I’ve started to work with proteins in 1967 and the transition from working in structural biology with proteins to working in proteomics is as much a semantic transition, as it is also a transition which is substantial.;358;Research
I could at least believe that you work with it because it is so beautiful, it’s like a piece of art. That is one protein?;Kurt Wüthrich: Well, this is one system of protein with a very important reaction partner, in this case the reaction partner is shown in red, blue and grey colours. These are what we would refer to as functional colours whereas the receptor protein, that is the protein inside the cell, that would bind this smaller effector molecule is shown in light blue.;358;Creativity
What does it do, this reaction part?;Kurt Wüthrich: This is cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A is a drug that prevents rejection of foreign tissue after an organ transplantation. It is sold under the name Sandimmun, it used to be a major product of the Sandoz pharmaceutical company. When we studied this structure, we had what is perhaps the biggest surprise I ever had in my career, we obtained the structure in which that molecule, after binding to its target in the cell looked when compared to its structure in the free state, looked that if a glove that has been ripped off your hand, with the inside coming out. A very big surprise which then gave important new information on possible modes of interaction of this drug molecule with its receptor and thus, in the next step, new guidelines for further research on this system.;358;Research
How are they so beautiful, colourful, when you look at them?;Kurt Wüthrich: This is what we add to our results. Proteins per se do not appear coloured to our eyes, except when they are combined with certain functional groups that are not of protein character and that may be visibly coloured.;358;Environment
One of the goals of proteomics is to make a full list of all the proteins, is it right?;Kurt Wüthrich: This is what has originally been proposed as the goal of what is called structural genomics. I think we should no longer talk about structural genomics, we should talk about proteomics and structural proteomics. I believe that the goals of structural proteomics have been rephrased, in particular on the side of the commercial enterprises who have also entered this field in that one has rather gone away from the idea of establishing a complete atlas of all three-dimensional proteins folds but rather focuses on certain classes of proteins and performs in depth studies that would go far beyond full determination and would include information relating to the functional properties of these proteins. It has also been clearly shown that the high- throughput  technology, which is of course one of the key gadgets that have been introduced with structural proteomics, are particularly easy and efficient to be used for serial investigations of closely similar proteinic systems. For example, given protein receptor studied with a large library of small ligand molecules that bind to it in order to get lead information for drug design, for example.;358;Research
How many proteins are there, if there are 30,000 genes. It’s just billions?;Kurt Wüthrich: Well, I said an infinite number in principle. This of course is an exaggeration, but it can be a very large number. I mean, the proteins that are combined with carbohydrate moieties, they’re made typically from one gene, you may get tens of thousands of very slightly different carbohydrate moieties attached to the protein in the so-called glycol proteins. It is well known that the carbohydrate parts are highly heterogeneous so you may have very wide variety there.;358;Meaning(Values) of Work
My final question would be, what do you think will be the next big discovery in this field?;Kurt Wüthrich: You see, in structural proteomics, we are faced with an enormous task of characterising not only one product per gene but a large multitude of gene products per gene and right now, it appears that we have to accumulate a large number of data. I mean in a typical proteomics project, we will no longer focus on one protein structure and try to make sense out of that structure, we would rather try to determine dozens or hundreds of structures and then from comparison of this data, derive novel information. This all looks extremely complicated, it looks as if an incredibly large amount of work will be needed and I think that a big breakthrough to be anticipated is that we will find simplicity in this very complex material that by getting a sufficiently large sample of experimental data, someone will all of a sudden again see common simplifying lines which might then enable us to handle the complexity of the proteome without undue demands on time, labour and money.;358;Future research
William Knowles, Ryoji Noyori and Barry Sharpless, my congratulations for this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry. And also welcome to this Nobel interview. All three of you are organic chemists and this means that you are looking into the chemistry of life. How would you describe the work of an organic chemist? Is the work that you are doing in your laboratories trying to imitate what nature does in the real world? Is this the right description?;"Ryoji Noyori: Not really so.
William S. Knowles: We make big molecules, that’s what nature does and we try to copy nature. And I think big complicated molecules.";359;Research
And you can find them in nature?;"William S. Knowles: Nature is full of them. We’re all great big molecules.
K. Barry Sharpless: I feel like we copy nature because we are nature. There’s a reverence for life’s chemistry that came from the origin of our field. In the beginning, Berzelius, here in Sweden, he didn’t really believe this. Stories about him were marvellous because he discovered selenium, which my first love is a research element. But I think he died believing in the vital force.
But his student, Wöhler, was the first person who made an organic compound. It was thought that you had to have an animal to make organic compounds. It was called vitalism or vis vitalis. So that monopoly was broken by Wöhler and he said I have to tell you Professor Berzelius that I found I can make urea without the help of a kidney or the dog or its kidney, or whatever. And that was the beginning of organic chemistry. We suddenly found we could actually make them.
Ryoji Noyori: And there are many important and useful compounds in nature. But that’s not enough. We need many other, more important artificial compounds, which can be synthesised by chemists.";359;Research
We need artificial compounds for what?;"Ryoji Noyori: For pharmaceutical drugs, in many cases artificial. So we have to synthesise using our chemical knowledge. That is our aim.
K. Barry Sharpless: Most of the drugs on the market today are no longer natural compounds, the only one I can think of is morphine.
William S. Knowles: Aspirin. There isn’t enough aspirin available to provide the demand, we have to make aspirin. And that was a tough synthesis in its day.";359;Meaning (Values) of Work
You use the words ‘blind watch-maker’, Barry, can you just talk about that?;"K. Barry Sharpless: It’s a book by Richard Dawkins and I particularly enjoy reading his works. He wrote The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watch-Maker. The Selfish Gene really hits you in the face because it says that everything, the grass, the flowers, the poinsettia’s behind you are us, the weed in the field. A lot of us have the gene. Some of the proteins and the genetic compounds are in insects and us. There’s so much that’s there just as a piece of boiler plate material that’s been there for billions of years. We are survival machines for genetic material, if you look at it coldly. And the genetic material picks combinations of genes, travelling companions that have survival value. In a sense, the cold-blooded way of viewing this is our organism part, our system that’s closed and functioning, is just a way to push genetic material into the future.
And then coming along behind that, Dawkins wrote The Blind Watch-Maker, which is if you look at life it seems impossible to imagine it wasn’t somehow created from above because it’s too invested in so many complexities. How could you get there if you weren’t there? There’s a chicken and egg problem that’s massive. And the idea of The Blind Watch-Maker, Dawkins says well how else could you get there? We had four billion years and a planet for this system to evolve and if you just cobble together things, and when life discovers a new way, it never throws out totally the old stuff. You know, it’s not the nature of the way that organisms can function. They learn something, it’s not quite perfect, they learn something else. This whole thing is so then complicated that we don’t know how it really works and we can’t imagine, so that’s why it’s The Blind Watch-Maker. In a sense, the only way it could have gotten there is by the way it got there.
William S. Knowles: But it’s interesting, we are capable of making all the parts, we don’t know how to put them together for the living cell. We can’t think of any of the parts of the living cell that we can’t make. But we have no idea how to put them together to get something that works like that. No idea.";359;Advice for young writers
Do you think that this is a problem of science, that it’s so reductionistic, that you see only the small details, the atoms and molecules, or as you say even big molecules, but these are very, very tiny parts of the whole? How can you get this whole picture then?;"Ryoji Noyori: It’s difficult at this moment.
William S. Knowles: It’s beyond us at this moment. It may not be by the next 100th anniversary though. When one looks ahead it’s very dangerous to say that it’s not impossible.
K. Barry Sharpless: But you hit the nail in that reductionist is the problem humans have and we get attracted to things we can understand and we go in deep on solving puzzles, but we don’t notice, and we like to see things sitting still. If something is moving it’s blurry usually and that’s what our area is, the three of us, we work on catalysts. Everything that’s moving, by definition, and if you see it sitting still, you can’t gather the essential facts about it. So that’s kind of a nice metaphor for complexity. Catalysts in life are always moving. Life itself is not what we see here in front of you. If the energy is not pouring through the system, the message that’s being read out is there are selective catalysts in our bodies, they’re burning energy. If you froze me and sent me to the other side of the universe and I was just the corpse then, there is no easy way to tell what the function of this machine was.
Ryoji Noyori: Understanding is rather easy, however more important is the creation of new functions. That’s very difficult.";359;Role of Science
What does it mean, understand? Can we tell what is life?;"Ryoji Noyori: No, I mean if you go to school and you have a class and the teacher will tell something, and you understand it. And that’s easy. But is that really full understanding?
William S. Knowles: But your question can we understand and define what life is? And this would take a lecture. You can’t just sit down and define life, can you? I don’t think we can. We can define the characteristics of life and it’s about five or six characteristics that all life seems to have, but we have a hard time saying this is not life and this is life. But we seem to know this, don’t we? That’s funny.
K. Barry Sharpless: But I think that distinction is going to be more and more blurred. There’s this new school of thought, the born and the made are going to move together in the next thousand years. And I definitely think it’s got to happen. These people that have always this cell phone here, I mean why not have it somehow built in? Some people don’t function without one. So there’s going to be a way to integrate the born and the made a little bit.
It’s a little strange idea but no, this is the way the world seems to be heading. It’s almost like science fiction but its not because if you think about it, well one thing I read, if you get to another planet, you know how they test to see if there’s any amino acids or life there, if you saw a little box with four wheels on it, you wouldn’t have to search any further, you’d know there had been life on that planet. I mean there are certain complexities that only can exist through living things. I think the amazing thing is that we think we understand as much as we do.
Take one little cell, as far as I’m concerned, the medium is the message there. And people thing the genome is going to solve things, I think they’re absolutely crazy. And because this is a linear message and it’s all entangled in itself and you can probably get different functions out of that box that’s called a cell, thousands of different ways, you could tweak it in a thousand ways and every one of them would end up in the same function. That would be a drug function. So you think you had this target, but if you did three other things you would have the same result, you know? It’s just a matter of we don’t go at it that way, we go right there and we think we know that target is there, and we’re going to hit it. And then it doesn’t work when they do it and six things that were compensated and the thing doesn’t have a prayer from the beginning, but they assume it did.
Ryoji Noyori: The function or life itself is an integrative issue. And a global issue. And it’s very hard to make it, on the other hand you can understand in detail just by analysis.
K. Barry Sharpless: You can understand within our sciences about what we know and how we know it. But it’s not about any absolute knowledge, we just have ways of knowing things that enable us to carry forward with so called advances. But I do think that the life issue, the complexity, is a fascinating area. My favourite book these days is Out of Control by Kevin Kelly and that’s a book that really describes some things that all of us can learn from.";359;Creativity
You mean it’s impossible to imitate the one hand of nature by chemistry?;"Ryoji Noyori: So the distinction between the right and the left, because the right and the left has the same physical energy or same free energy.
William S. Knowles: And it’s still that way.";359;Research
But do you recognise this way of making discoveries, that you have a problem and you are somehow waiting how to solve it? The solution comes just by random. Is this called serendipity?;"William S. Knowles: I don’t like the word serendipity. I prefer luck. Because I think serendipity, in my mind, doesn’t seem to imply much intelligence. It seems there were these guys wandering around and lucky things happened to them. To me it doesn’t, I like to think I had luck, but I like there was a little intelligence behind this.
K. Barry Sharpless: I think you’re right, the serendipity one is a bit too much like really luck. Sometimes people are calling intuitive as well, which is related to this idea of they’re going to be able to take advantage of serendipity more because they’re actually open to it. And I think intuitive is a way that people who aren’t creative will describe creative people because they don’t see the method by which the information leads these people to the answer they get. I mean people that are intuitive often take in as much, if not more information, facts and feelings and connections than the people who are linear. So I think intuitive people actually are just using their information in a different way.
William S. Knowles: It’s also that, at least certainly the breakthroughs in science, you almost have to be active and your lucky break comes along. Never where or when you expect it, and the ones that succeed take advantage of that lucky break. And most people don’t bother to take advantage.
Ryoji Noyori: So we should be lucky. But I think discoveries are made accidentally, but that’s not real accident.";359;Creativity
But it’s not only that you understand the parts, but you are also fascinated by this world. So I have a final question, you live with the molecules or the chemistry, you see the beauty and fascination of this world, but there is still all those people out there that cannot understand what you see is the most beautiful thing in the world. How do you manage to bridge over this gap? Do you see it as a problem?;"William S. Knowles: Not very well. This is a big frustration, bridging over the gap. We’ve talked a lot about that this week but we really haven’t come up with terribly good ideas for doing it, I don’t think. But it is desirable to bridge it.
K. Barry Sharpless: I do it as best I can through the sensual approach, that is chemistry organic is right in there for you because they almost all have a taste and a smell. And the big ones don’t smell but the little guys smell. So we notice flowers, fragrances, body odours, oils on your skin, all those things are easy for people to get interested in. But as far as life goes, I’ve found myself being attracted back, having the adventure we’ve had, finding we can be promiscuous and not be very selective but still get right and left. I find to get at the complexity of life maybe I need to use her proteins and things as reaction vessels themselves.
So I have an idea where I’m going to try and go back to mother. Mother inspired us, she’s the enzyme to do the right and left. It turns out that’s easier than many parts of making complex structures. So my thought is to go back and now use the real power of nature. Put the real message in completely. The actual encoding of all those touches, the molecules are touched, everyone’s touching each other. When we do it we use our hands. Our hands are very big and we’re actually pretending to run reactions at the molecular level by using our hands. That’s what it comes down to.
Ryoji Noyori: So the chemists are being interested in the structure of molecules. And now we can fully understand the structure, but that’s not enough. So important is the creation of functions from organic molecules, that’s integrated matter and very difficult to understand. I think that we should know more about biology and also physics. That’s really an integrated pro-gender issue.
K. Barry Sharpless: The function is really what we need to deliver faster, especially at affordable price, medicine and materials that people can build with. And we just don’t have much experience with speeding up. This speed is a thousand times less than it should be if we’re going to try to provide for the rest of the world at a decent level, like we have here in Sweden and Japan and the United States.
Ryoji Noyori: And I think the scientific research has been analytical. However that should be more scientific. So the integration of many simple elements generating anew our functions.
William S. Knowles: We can go on this discussion forever really. It’s absolutely fascinating.";359;Motivation

If I come back to the vital force, do you think that you ever can make something that’s alive in the laboratory?;"K. Barry Sharpless: In principle, I don’t see why not. But in practice, there’s a lot of hubris involved in even imagining you could. But I don’t see why not in principle. In fact I could even imagine somehow on this planet, if the evolution of life continues long enough, that DNA could be replaced as the replicator. There’s many things that you could imagine that life would move on and discover a better replicator, or a different one. It’s almost impossible right now to conceive, but we’re involved in evolution now right?
We do chemistry, Ryoji, Bill and I, but we’re humans and so we’re natural. And so what we’re doing is not man-made in my opinion, it’s kind of on the side and you could almost say the blind watch-maker is using us to see if we can do some good for life, right? Because if we do succeed, we may end up using chemistry that we can do better than nature and just enhancing her functions because that enhances our functions. It’s a kind of a circular thing.
Ryoji Noyori: So, nature is using the enzymes, that is a bio-catalyst. However, the utility is limited by the lock and the key specificity. The chemistry is more general. We can synthesise a variety of artificial compounds, either natural or unnatural.";360;Creativity
Do you think that this is a problem of science, that it’s so reductionistic, that you see only the small details, the atoms and molecules, or as you say even big molecules, but these are very, very tiny parts of the whole?

But it’s not about any absolute knowledge, we just have ways of knowing things that enable us to carry forward with so called advances. But I do think that the life issue, the complexity, is a fascinating area. My favourite book these days is Out of Control by Kevin Kelly and that’s a book that really describes some things that all of us can learn from.";360;Creativity
So what was the idea?;"William S. Knowles: I think that every organic chemist has felt frustrated about having to resolve racemic mixtures. And this has limited what organic chemists have done. They say, oh god, I’ve got to resolve that, I don’t want to do that if I don’t really have to. And it’s a chore. And so I think they’ve all felt there should be a nicer way to get around this, but you have to wait until some good idea comes along. You see what others have done and they’re not really getting very far on the thing, there was a big Japanese programme with Akaburi on this rule, all aware of this I’m sure, but it didn’t look as if I could add anything to what they had done.
It didn’t look a thing, then suddenly something comes along and they say, well Jesus, this is a great new approach to this. Be worth trying. And that’s exactly what it was. But I wasn’t really thinking of any particularly molecule, I’d have settled for any molecule that I do around this, it wouldn’t make any difference. Any sort of what we call a pro-chiral molecule, pro-chiral molecule is your hydrogenates, you get a new asymmetric centre, racemic form. And so I would’ve settled for any one. Actually I chose one that never did work with us very well.
Ryoji Noyori: 150 years ago, Pasteur mentioned the dissymmetry is only in the strict boundary between the biological system and chemical or physical system. And he mentioned that it’s impossible to generate that dissymmetry by using a chemical or physical force.";360;Creativity
You mean it’s impossible to imitate the one hand of nature by chemistry?;"Ryoji Noyori: So the distinction between the right and the left, because the right and the left has the same physical energy or same free energy.
William S. Knowles: And it’s still that way.";360;Research
But do you recognise this way of making discoveries, that you have a problem and you are somehow waiting how to solve it? The solution comes just by random. Is this called serendipity?;"William S. Knowles: I don’t like the word serendipity. I prefer luck. Because I think serendipity, in my mind, doesn’t seem to imply much intelligence. It seems there were these guys wandering around and lucky things happened to them. To me it doesn’t, I like to think I had luck, but I like there was a little intelligence behind this.
K. Barry Sharpless: I think you’re right, the serendipity one is a bit too much like really luck. Sometimes people are calling intuitive as well, which is related to this idea of they’re going to be able to take advantage of serendipity more because they’re actually open to it. And I think intuitive is a way that people who aren’t creative will describe creative people because they don’t see the method by which the information leads these people to the answer they get. I mean people that are intuitive often take in as much, if not more information, facts and feelings and connections than the people who are linear. So I think intuitive people actually are just using their information in a different way.
William S. Knowles: It’s also that, at least certainly the breakthroughs in science, you almost have to be active and your lucky break comes along. Never where or when you expect it, and the ones that succeed take advantage of that lucky break. And most people don’t bother to take advantage.
Ryoji Noyori: So we should be lucky. But I think discoveries are made accidentally, but that’s not real accident.";360;Creativity
But what does intuition mean in that, that you look at the right things?;"K. Barry Sharpless: You worked it, you kind of get attracted to the areas where you have a better chance. In this book, Kevin Kelly’s book, it’s kind of interesting, life itself is attracted to instabilities though. I mean it’s obviously connected, in my belief, all these things connect back to facts in the end. That the DNA does contain the information that leads these systems to where they go, but it almost seems like life systems want to be near the edge of chaos because his image is riding a wave, you know, surfer riding a wave.
If you’re up high on the wave and the wave goes forever and you can stay in the zone and you have movement, you have power, potential energy. If you get over the top of the wave, you could die. But if you’re down back on the wave in a trough, you can’t move. And move means evolve. You have to be having movement and life is attracted to instability and creative discoveries come from points of instability in chaos. You have chaos in catalysis. And catalysis is life really. You need to be near this slippery area, partly because you need speed. Speed is really crucial.
Ryoji Noyori: So the discovery is a matter about kinetics rather than thermal dynamics. We need some thermal dynamics and then we need some basic knowledge. But that’s not enough.";360;Creativity
But it’s not only that you understand the parts, but you are also fascinated by this world. So I have a final question, you live with the molecules or the chemistry, you see the beauty and fascination of this world, but there is still all those people out there that cannot understand what you see is the most beautiful thing in the world. How do you manage to bridge over this gap? Do you see it as a problem?;"William S. Knowles: Not very well. This is a big frustration, bridging over the gap. We’ve talked a lot about that this week but we really haven’t come up with terribly good ideas for doing it, I don’t think. But it is desirable to bridge it.
K. Barry Sharpless: I do it as best I can through the sensual approach, that is chemistry organic is right in there for you because they almost all have a taste and a smell. And the big ones don’t smell but the little guys smell. So we notice flowers, fragrances, body odours, oils on your skin, all those things are easy for people to get interested in. But as far as life goes, I’ve found myself being attracted back, having the adventure we’ve had, finding we can be promiscuous and not be very selective but still get right and left. I find to get at the complexity of life maybe I need to use her proteins and things as reaction vessels themselves.
So I have an idea where I’m going to try and go back to mother. Mother inspired us, she’s the enzyme to do the right and left. It turns out that’s easier than many parts of making complex structures. So my thought is to go back and now use the real power of nature. Put the real message in completely. The actual encoding of all those touches, the molecules are touched, everyone’s touching each other. When we do it we use our hands. Our hands are very big and we’re actually pretending to run reactions at the molecular level by using our hands. That’s what it comes down to.
Ryoji Noyori: So the chemists are being interested in the structure of molecules. And now we can fully understand the structure, but that’s not enough. So important is the creation of functions from organic molecules, that’s integrated matter and very difficult to understand. I think that we should know more about biology and also physics. That’s really an integrated pro-gender issue.
K. Barry Sharpless: The function is really what we need to deliver faster, especially at affordable price, medicine and materials that people can build with. And we just don’t have much experience with speeding up. This speed is a thousand times less than it should be if we’re going to try to provide for the rest of the world at a decent level, like we have here in Sweden and Japan and the United States.
Ryoji Noyori: And I think the scientific research has been analytical. However that should be more scientific. So the integration of many simple elements generating anew our functions.
William S. Knowles: We can go on this discussion forever really. It’s absolutely fascinating.";360;Motivation
And you can find them in nature?;"William S. Knowles: Nature is full of them. We’re all great big molecules.
K. Barry Sharpless: I feel like we copy nature because we are nature. There’s a reverence for life’s chemistry that came from the origin of our field. In the beginning, Berzelius, here in Sweden, he didn’t really believe this. Stories about him were marvellous because he discovered selenium, which my first love is a research element. But I think he died believing in the vital force.
But his student, Wöhler, was the first person who made an organic compound. It was thought that you had to have an animal to make organic compounds. It was called vitalism or vis vitalis. So that monopoly was broken by Wöhler and he said I have to tell you Professor Berzelius that I found I can make urea without the help of a kidney or the dog or its kidney, or whatever. And that was the beginning of organic chemistry. We suddenly found we could actually make them.
Ryoji Noyori: And there are many important and useful compounds in nature. But that’s not enough. We need many other, more important artificial compounds, which can be synthesised by chemists.";361;Research
We need artificial compounds for what?;"Ryoji Noyori: For pharmaceutical drugs, in many cases artificial. So we have to synthesise using our chemical knowledge. That is our aim.
K. Barry Sharpless: Most of the drugs on the market today are no longer natural compounds, the only one I can think of is morphine.
William S. Knowles: Aspirin. There isn’t enough aspirin available to provide the demand, we have to make aspirin. And that was a tough synthesis in its day.";361;Meaning (Values) of Work
If I come back to the vital force, do you think that you ever can make something that’s alive in the laboratory?;"K. Barry Sharpless: In principle, I don’t see why not. But in practice, there’s a lot of hubris involved in even imagining you could. But I don’t see why not in principle. In fact I could even imagine somehow on this planet, if the evolution of life continues long enough, that DNA could be replaced as the replicator. There’s many things that you could imagine that life would move on and discover a better replicator, or a different one. It’s almost impossible right now to conceive, but we’re involved in evolution now right?
We do chemistry, Ryoji, Bill and I, but we’re humans and so we’re natural. And so what we’re doing is not man-made in my opinion, it’s kind of on the side and you could almost say the blind watch-maker is using us to see if we can do some good for life, right? Because if we do succeed, we may end up using chemistry that we can do better than nature and just enhancing her functions because that enhances our functions. It’s a kind of a circular thing.
Ryoji Noyori: So, nature is using the enzymes, that is a bio-catalyst. However, the utility is limited by the lock and the key specificity. The chemistry is more general. We can synthesise a variety of artificial compounds, either natural or unnatural.";361;Creativity
You use the words ‘blind watch-maker’, Barry, can you just talk about that?;"K. Barry Sharpless: It’s a book by Richard Dawkins and I particularly enjoy reading his works. He wrote The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watch-Maker. The Selfish Gene really hits you in the face because it says that everything, the grass, the flowers, the poinsettia’s behind you are us, the weed in the field. A lot of us have the gene. Some of the proteins and the genetic compounds are in insects and us. There’s so much that’s there just as a piece of boiler plate material that’s been there for billions of years. We are survival machines for genetic material, if you look at it coldly. And the genetic material picks combinations of genes, travelling companions that have survival value. In a sense, the cold-blooded way of viewing this is our organism part, our system that’s closed and functioning, is just a way to push genetic material into the future.
And then coming along behind that, Dawkins wrote The Blind Watch-Maker, which is if you look at life it seems impossible to imagine it wasn’t somehow created from above because it’s too invested in so many complexities. How could you get there if you weren’t there? There’s a chicken and egg problem that’s massive. And the idea of The Blind Watch-Maker, Dawkins says well how else could you get there? We had four billion years and a planet for this system to evolve and if you just cobble together things, and when life discovers a new way, it never throws out totally the old stuff. You know, it’s not the nature of the way that organisms can function. They learn something, it’s not quite perfect, they learn something else. This whole thing is so then complicated that we don’t know how it really works and we can’t imagine, so that’s why it’s The Blind Watch-Maker. In a sense, the only way it could have gotten there is by the way it got there.
William S. Knowles: But it’s interesting, we are capable of making all the parts, we don’t know how to put them together for the living cell. We can’t think of any of the parts of the living cell that we can’t make. But we have no idea how to put them together to get something that works like that. No idea.";361;Advice for young writers
Do you think that this is a problem of science, that it’s so reductionistic, that you see only the small details, the atoms and molecules, or as you say even big molecules, but these are very, very tiny parts of the whole? How can you get this whole picture then?;"Ryoji Noyori: It’s difficult at this moment.
William S. Knowles: It’s beyond us at this moment. It may not be by the next 100th anniversary though. When one looks ahead it’s very dangerous to say that it’s not impossible.
K. Barry Sharpless: But you hit the nail in that reductionist is the problem humans have and we get attracted to things we can understand and we go in deep on solving puzzles, but we don’t notice, and we like to see things sitting still. If something is moving it’s blurry usually and that’s what our area is, the three of us, we work on catalysts. Everything that’s moving, by definition, and if you see it sitting still, you can’t gather the essential facts about it. So that’s kind of a nice metaphor for complexity. Catalysts in life are always moving. Life itself is not what we see here in front of you. If the energy is not pouring through the system, the message that’s being read out is there are selective catalysts in our bodies, they’re burning energy. If you froze me and sent me to the other side of the universe and I was just the corpse then, there is no easy way to tell what the function of this machine was.
Ryoji Noyori: Understanding is rather easy, however more important is the creation of new functions. That’s very difficult.";361;Role of Science
What does it mean, understand? Can we tell what is life?;"Ryoji Noyori: No, I mean if you go to school and you have a class and the teacher will tell something, and you understand it. And that’s easy. But is that really full understanding?
William S. Knowles: But your question can we understand and define what life is? And this would take a lecture. You can’t just sit down and define life, can you? I don’t think we can. We can define the characteristics of life and it’s about five or six characteristics that all life seems to have, but we have a hard time saying this is not life and this is life. But we seem to know this, don’t we? That’s funny.
K. Barry Sharpless: But I think that distinction is going to be more and more blurred. There’s this new school of thought, the born and the made are going to move together in the next thousand years. And I definitely think it’s got to happen. These people that have always this cell phone here, I mean why not have it somehow built in? Some people don’t function without one. So there’s going to be a way to integrate the born and the made a little bit.
It’s a little strange idea but no, this is the way the world seems to be heading. It’s almost like science fiction but its not because if you think about it, well one thing I read, if you get to another planet, you know how they test to see if there’s any amino acids or life there, if you saw a little box with four wheels on it, you wouldn’t have to search any further, you’d know there had been life on that planet. I mean there are certain complexities that only can exist through living things. I think the amazing thing is that we think we understand as much as we do.
Take one little cell, as far as I’m concerned, the medium is the message there. And people thing the genome is going to solve things, I think they’re absolutely crazy. And because this is a linear message and it’s all entangled in itself and you can probably get different functions out of that box that’s called a cell, thousands of different ways, you could tweak it in a thousand ways and every one of them would end up in the same function. That would be a drug function. So you think you had this target, but if you did three other things you would have the same result, you know? It’s just a matter of we don’t go at it that way, we go right there and we think we know that target is there, and we’re going to hit it. And then it doesn’t work when they do it and six things that were compensated and the thing doesn’t have a prayer from the beginning, but they assume it did.
Ryoji Noyori: The function or life itself is an integrative issue. And a global issue. And it’s very hard to make it, on the other hand you can understand in detail just by analysis.
K. Barry Sharpless: You can understand within our sciences about what we know and how we know it.

What were the obstacles?;Alan Heeger: The obstacles are very, very real. Part of the obstacles are of course these language issues and the different concepts, but I think in this case it was more than that. I mean, we were taking on a really difficult problem with hindsight. We were either courageous or foolish because it was a very difficult problem and if you look back at it at that time and say how would you get through this? Even in the 1990s, which is now, let’s say, 20 years after the original discoveries, there were many people in the scientific community, our colleagues, who seriously doubted that you could ever achieve the purity in the materials that you would need to make, for example, semiconductor devices. Turns out that you can, turns out that you can do so for very fundamental reasons but we didn’t know that early on and so you just go ahead, it’ll work out.;362;Creativity
So how did you manage? How did you manage to get funding, for example?;"Alan MacDiarmid: The funding aspect is, as we have been discussing recently during this Nobel week, I think, very important indeed and, Hideki and Alan, just last week I was looking at our original letter when we submitted our first communication, and we sent a copy of this letter to Dr Ken Wynn at the Office of Naval Research. Here we apologised for the fact that most of the work – we actually had this in the second to last paragraph in the letter written 23 years ago – we apologised for the fact that most of the work had been done on moonlighting, moonlighting on other grants. But we then said that the other grants were acknowledged and of course by moonlighting, one refers to the fact where one is actually doing research which is not necessarily encompassed in a given subject matter for which we are receiving funding.
Alan Heeger: But the agencies which supplied those funds were very pleased. I mean, success is success. The early work that we did together was indeed spectacular, although, I must say, the first papers were not easily accepted by the appropriate journals, but once it got out, I mean, it was clearly an exciting time and funding was not a problem. I think, as I recall, the biggest issue in that context, in a slightly larger context, was that there was immediately a positive response by industry. They saw the potential, the dream of a new class of materials which would have the electrical and optical properties of metals but retain the processing advantages and mechanical properties of plastics, but it wasn’t true then. It was still a dream. It was 20 years away or whatever and so there was this initial big push, I would say, or at least start-up of quite a lot of activity in industrial laboratories and they quickly became disillusioned. It was only because the funding agencies that were supporting the universities and supported our programmes and our colleagues around the world that we got through this valley, because it did take, let’s say, 15 years before we began to see materials that might someday be really useful.
Alan MacDiarmid: I think in this respect, to stress again the difficulty we had in convincing some of our colleagues that one could work in an area of dirty nasty organic polymers, not nice crystal and materials. There’s one person, a colleague we were discussing within the very early days, concerning collaborative interaction and I remember well this person said something which represented the opinion of many. He said Alan, you know, all of this is a junk effect, don’t touch it. Then I said to this person, well, if you know what the junk is and you know how to put it in controllably and you know how to take it out controllably, could you not possibly call it a doping effect? But I think this overall fell in the past, in the whole area of electronic materials. The physicists, both academic and those in industry, had been dealing with nice, clean crystal inorganic materials and now you came to a yucky polymer, not nicely crystal and just urgh, you wouldn’t touch it.
Hideki Shirakawa: Speaking about the founding, Japan has a really different system as far as the university concerns. The faculty in the National University has received maybe one or two million yen per year without any proposer so within that money we can do without any restriction. I mean, that as I …
Alan Heeger: As you want.
Hideki Shirakawa: As I want to.
Alan MacDiarmid: That’s good.
Hideki Shirakawa: In that sense, the basic research can do.
Alan MacDiarmid: That is still the case, Hideki?
Hideki Shirakawa: Yes, it’s still, yes.
Alan MacDiarmid: That’s excellent.";362;Creativity
That’s what I wonder, how do you actually do a discovery? Is it a trial and error process? How do you come into the discovery?;"Alan Heeger: No, no, discovery is discovery. You don’t predict it, right, and it comes in its time. You can be aware of events in a field so that perhaps you’re prepared. You can be aware that something’s going on over here that will stimulate your mind, but discovery is discovery. What can one say?
Hideki Shirakawa: And it’s very difficult to predict.
Alan MacDiarmid: Or if you put it in other terms, that if you plot, say, a straight line, here you have known data and then from the known data, then in principle you can extrapolate to the future new types of phenomena based on that known data but it’s an extrapolation of the curve; but the real exciting things are where, rather than extrapolation of the curve, you have a point way over here which is not on the curve, which is not data which you do not necessarily expect from the data and information which is already known. But once you get that new point and look at it for a while, then you can look back and say yes, of course, this is exactly what you’d expect. But at the time you get it, you don’t.
Alan Heeger: And the other aspect, I suppose, of discovery is to come to a conclusion on the basis of too few facts to really get you that conclusion that enables you then to say, well let’s try that, ok? And then you have a discovery, ok? In that sense, you can’t deduce the result from the facts that you have but by being creative, you can say well, put these ideas together in your mind and it makes something whole to you. Of course, it’s still a hypothesis and then it works and then you’re off and running?
Alan MacDiarmid: Or it doesn’t work and then you modify the hypothesis accordingly.";362;Creativity
What is the characteristics of a good scientist? Is it high IQ or being creative, as you say?;"Hideki Shirakawa: Their personality should be very curious, ask why, ask what happens and have many interests in everything.
Alan MacDiarmid: Or in other words, I feel one has to live it, eat it, dream it, sleep it, has to be complete immersion and I like to try to point out to some of my students at times that the creative scientist is just as much an artist as a person composing a symphony or painting a beautiful painting and I say have you ever heard of a composer who has started composing his symphony at 9 o’clock in the morning and composes it to 12 noon and then goes out and has lunch with his friends and plays cards and then starts composing his symphony again at 1 o’clock in the afternoon and continues through ‘til 5 o’clock in the afternoon and then goes back home and watches television and opens a can of beer and then starts the next morning composing his symphony? Of course the answer is no. The same thing with a research scientist. You can’t get it out of your mind. It envelopes your whole personality. You have to keep pushing it until you come to the end of a certain segment.
Alan Heeger: Persistence is important. Of course, intelligence and IQ are important, of course, but I was going to say unfortunately or, whatever, I know many people who have far higher IQs that I envy so persistence is very important and also an ability to just focus. The autobiographies that you read about, for example, Einstein as the classic scientist suggest that he could just focus on a problem and just not let go of it for a time and with an intensity that is just far more than most of us can do and evidently that has something to do with success in science.";362;Competencies
I know that you both, two Alans, are known for being workaholic, I would say. Do you have any other passions besides science?;"Alan Heeger: Many things. I love the theatre. We have a wonderful theatre group in Santa Barbara and I’m on the board of directors of that theatre group and support it and Ruth and I always like to go to London and to New York to the theatre. I love music. We’re great opera fans. We were at the opera the night before we left to come to Stockholm, but the real passion, I must say, is downhill skiing so I’ve gotten my whole family to be similarly enthusiastic about skiing and in fact we’re all going next week for a holiday to relax from this very hard-working Nobel week for a week of downhill skiing, so as a sport that’s the one that I like.
Alan MacDiarmid: You see, Alan’s skiing is snow skiing. Ours is water-skiing. We have a house beside the largest lake in Pennsylvania in the Pocono mountains and all of my children and my wife and grandchildren, we like to get up very early in the morning, about 6 o’clock when the lake is absolutely flat, before other people have gone out onto the lake, and then we go water-skiing together and we do slalom skiing, also one ski skiing and it’s really fun, I find. This last summer, for example, to be actually out water-skiing not only with my children but with my grandchildren.
Alan Heeger: Oh yes, that’s great fun. How about you Hideki, are you a sportsman?
Hideki Shirakawa: In my case my way to relax is to grow plants and also I keep my garden.
Alan MacDiarmid: I’ve seen your lovely cactus in your garden when I visited.
Alan Heeger: I remember you took cactus plants with you from Philadelphia 25 years ago. Do they still exist?
Hideki Shirakawa: Still exist, yes. Not to large but maybe this size.
Alan Heeger: In Santa Barbara, I planted cactus in one year. The next year, the next year, they really grow.";362;Motivation
So how did you manage? How did you manage to get funding, for example?;"Alan MacDiarmid: The funding aspect is, as we have been discussing recently during this Nobel week, I think, very important indeed and, Hideki and Alan, just last week I was looking at our original letter when we submitted our first communication, and we sent a copy of this letter to Dr Ken Wynn at the Office of Naval Research. Here we apologised for the fact that most of the work – we actually had this in the second to last paragraph in the letter written 23 years ago – we apologised for the fact that most of the work had been done on moonlighting, moonlighting on other grants. But we then said that the other grants were acknowledged and of course by moonlighting, one refers to the fact where one is actually doing research which is not necessarily encompassed in a given subject matter for which we are receiving funding.
Alan Heeger: But the agencies which supplied those funds were very pleased. I mean, success is success. The early work that we did together was indeed spectacular, although, I must say, the first papers were not easily accepted by the appropriate journals, but once it got out, I mean, it was clearly an exciting time and funding was not a problem. I think, as I recall, the biggest issue in that context, in a slightly larger context, was that there was immediately a positive response by industry. They saw the potential, the dream of a new class of materials which would have the electrical and optical properties of metals but retain the processing advantages and mechanical properties of plastics, but it wasn’t true then. It was still a dream. It was 20 years away or whatever and so there was this initial big push, I would say, or at least start-up of quite a lot of activity in industrial laboratories and they quickly became disillusioned. It was only because the funding agencies that were supporting the universities and supported our programmes and our colleagues around the world that we got through this valley, because it did take, let’s say, 15 years before we began to see materials that might someday be really useful.
Alan MacDiarmid: I think in this respect, to stress again the difficulty we had in convincing some of our colleagues that one could work in an area of dirty nasty organic polymers, not nice crystal and materials. There’s one person, a colleague we were discussing within the very early days, concerning collaborative interaction and I remember well this person said something which represented the opinion of many. He said Alan, you know, all of this is a junk effect, don’t touch it. Then I said to this person, well, if you know what the junk is and you know how to put it in controllably and you know how to take it out controllably, could you not possibly call it a doping effect? But I think this overall fell in the past, in the whole area of electronic materials. The physicists, both academic and those in industry, had been dealing with nice, clean crystal inorganic materials and now you came to a yucky polymer, not nicely crystal and just urgh, you wouldn’t touch it.
Hideki Shirakawa: Speaking about the founding, Japan has a really different system as far as the university concerns. The faculty in the National University has received maybe one or two million yen per year without any proposer so within that money we can do without any restriction. I mean, that as I …
Alan Heeger: As you want.
Hideki Shirakawa: As I want to.
Alan MacDiarmid: That’s good.
Hideki Shirakawa: In that sense, the basic research can do.
Alan MacDiarmid: That is still the case, Hideki?
Hideki Shirakawa: Yes, it’s still, yes.
Alan MacDiarmid: That’s excellent.";363;Creativity
That’s what I wonder, how do you actually do a discovery? Is it a trial and error process? How do you come into the discovery?;"Alan Heeger: No, no, discovery is discovery. You don’t predict it, right, and it comes in its time. You can be aware of events in a field so that perhaps you’re prepared. You can be aware that something’s going on over here that will stimulate your mind, but discovery is discovery. What can one say?
Hideki Shirakawa: And it’s very difficult to predict.
Alan MacDiarmid: Or if you put it in other terms, that if you plot, say, a straight line, here you have known data and then from the known data, then in principle you can extrapolate to the future new types of phenomena based on that known data but it’s an extrapolation of the curve; but the real exciting things are where, rather than extrapolation of the curve, you have a point way over here which is not on the curve, which is not data which you do not necessarily expect from the data and information which is already known. But once you get that new point and look at it for a while, then you can look back and say yes, of course, this is exactly what you’d expect. But at the time you get it, you don’t.
Alan Heeger: And the other aspect, I suppose, of discovery is to come to a conclusion on the basis of too few facts to really get you that conclusion that enables you then to say, well let’s try that, ok? And then you have a discovery, ok? In that sense, you can’t deduce the result from the facts that you have but by being creative, you can say well, put these ideas together in your mind and it makes something whole to you. Of course, it’s still a hypothesis and then it works and then you’re off and running?
Alan MacDiarmid: Or it doesn’t work and then you modify the hypothesis accordingly.";363;Creativity
What is the characteristics of a good scientist? Is it high IQ or being creative, as you say?;"Hideki Shirakawa: Their personality should be very curious, ask why, ask what happens and have many interests in everything.
Alan MacDiarmid: Or in other words, I feel one has to live it, eat it, dream it, sleep it, has to be complete immersion and I like to try to point out to some of my students at times that the creative scientist is just as much an artist as a person composing a symphony or painting a beautiful painting and I say have you ever heard of a composer who has started composing his symphony at 9 o’clock in the morning and composes it to 12 noon and then goes out and has lunch with his friends and plays cards and then starts composing his symphony again at 1 o’clock in the afternoon and continues through ‘til 5 o’clock in the afternoon and then goes back home and watches television and opens a can of beer and then starts the next morning composing his symphony? Of course the answer is no. The same thing with a research scientist. You can’t get it out of your mind. It envelopes your whole personality. You have to keep pushing it until you come to the end of a certain segment.
Alan Heeger: Persistence is important. Of course, intelligence and IQ are important, of course, but I was going to say unfortunately or, whatever, I know many people who have far higher IQs that I envy so persistence is very important and also an ability to just focus. The autobiographies that you read about, for example, Einstein as the classic scientist suggest that he could just focus on a problem and just not let go of it for a time and with an intensity that is just far more than most of us can do and evidently that has something to do with success in science.";363;Competencies
I know that you both, two Alans, are known for being workaholic, I would say. Do you have any other passions besides science?;Alan MacDiarmid: I like to work hard and play hard. Not very much in between, it’s either work or play and whatever I do, I like to put my full energy into it.;363;Motivation

I know that you both, two Alans, are known for being workaholic, I would say. Do you have any other passions besides science?;"Alan Heeger: Many things. I love the theatre. We have a wonderful theatre group in Santa Barbara and I’m on the board of directors of that theatre group and support it and Ruth and I always like to go to London and to New York to the theatre. I love music. We’re great opera fans. We were at the opera the night before we left to come to Stockholm, but the real passion, I must say, is downhill skiing so I’ve gotten my whole family to be similarly enthusiastic about skiing and in fact we’re all going next week for a holiday to relax from this very hard-working Nobel week for a week of downhill skiing, so as a sport that’s the one that I like.
Alan MacDiarmid: You see, Alan’s skiing is snow skiing. Ours is water-skiing.

And second, you’re very welcome now to the Nobel Foundation for this discussion or conversation. You were rewarded for, in particular, having provided the basic tool of analysis or model to help us understand how economic policy functions in a world with high international mobility of capital. And how monetary and fiscal policy have different effects on national economies if we have floating exchange rates or fixed exchange rates. What was the inspiration of your work? To what extend was it that you looked up the world and saw some problems? And to what extent were you inspired by peer groups, by other scholars, by your teachers, etcetera?;"Well, my first inclination is to say all of the above. But all three of those were important. But in my early days, I wrote my dissertation for MIT at the London School of Economics, really under James Meade, but my dissertation was five chapters on the theory of capital movement, but it didn’t mention money. Money was not … it was a pure development of the classical model to which its higher form is, I think it had been developed, and so there was no monetary or macro, what you would call, what we would call macro considerations, in it. But in the … after I had completed that framework, I felt that now that was a very safe and good box to have for studying economic, long running economic problems, but it wasn’t a good way of analysing, of course, exchange rates and financial problems that hadn’t been modelled in the international economy. And it was then the attempt to find a way of modelling it that became important. And where, I think, the breakthrough in my own thinking of this occurred was with the development with what became my paper. My first paper and most important paper on this model was published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in May 1960, with the monetary dynamics of fixed and flexible exchange rates.
And in that paper, I think the key element, breakthrough, that I thought for myself that I was making was in the seeing the economy as determined by a combination of two basic macro economic conditions. One is equilibrium in the goods and services market, and equilibrium in the foreign exchange market. And so that led to a kind of international counterpart, if you like, of an IS/LM framework, and so had one curve which gave us macroeconomic equilibrium which was very similar to a kind of generalised IS/LM curve, but with exports and imports in it, and then the other curve was a balance of payments equilibrium equation. And then interest rates and exchange rates would then be the principle variable thing, determining that kind of equilibrium. Now for me, that was an illumination of thinking because it was a way in which I could quickly move from that framework into a general equilibrium framework and put as many markets in as I wanted.";852;Mentors (Role models)
Your main contribution I think was that you made some general analysis which meant that previous analysis fell out as special cases of your general approach.;"Well, Meade’s work was … the part of Meade’s work that was … could have been relevant was in his mathematical supplement to the balance of payments, and in that model he had some kind of integration of the Keynes’ and Hicks‘ formulation that was good, and somehow I never picked up on that. It was … of course, I sat there, but he never did anything with it himself, he never seemed to bring that into his, any of his analysis, and … I was working when I was thinking about that in terms of the classical version of the model, not when I was writing my thesis, working, thinking about Meade. But it was in Chicago, I think, where I discovered I say, I mean I first read Metzler’s work, on … saving the rate of interest. And I should say it was rather Metzler’s work that that was the closed economy version of what became my first paper, the first major paper on this, on the macro side in 1960 on monetary dynamics.
So the dynamic part of it was very much from Metzler?
Professor Robert A. Mundell: No, of course Metzler in … this whole framework that was flowering at Chicago at this time, but the dynamics were of course completely different from Metzler’s because the subject was different. But the pattern of development was the same. Simonson and Metzler in all my dynamic works, just as Metzler was in a way a student of Paul Samuelson, I mean a colleague of his, but it was Samuelson’s dynamic analysis that spurred everybody, despite of me, and I learned that very well. And that shows it, so it was a combination of a little bit of Metzler, definitely Metzler and Samuelson. Samuelson’s technique, Metzler’s analysis of the closed economy dynamics and then my formulation of that in the framework of two grand markets, the dominating policy making in the international economy. And then later became, this is the point I wanted to make, this is 1960 and I think that paper was the most important paper I wrote.
And I came up with a formulation that was really quite different from what the others had thought,  …
And then subsequently in my other papers, Kyklos and The International Disequilibrium System, 1961. That was an important paper but that took the framework of the much more the IS/LM framework, the Hicks IS/LM framework, that was not a Metzlerian type paper, that was more a Hicksian type paper in the open economy. Hicksian with Metzlerian and Samsonian dynamics in it. And then came the work on the monetary fiscal policy mixed with the IMF, and that was a question, partly, a question of selling. It was a question of people … I thought, with Jack Polak when I came to the IMF, Jack Polak was there, Fleming was away, and Polak asked me to work … study this question that caused Hicks so much controversy, on the appropriate monetary fiscal policy mix for the United States. And everybody was saying different things about it. And I came up with a formulation that was really quite different from what the others had thought, and evolved the policy mix idea that was important. But then this was put in the Keynesian type framework because the desire … everyone’s speaking Keynesian language in order to communicate with the communists at that time, it was necessary to speak the Keynesian language.
And then later this paper, which is published in March 1962 in Staff Papers, came under attack from the Federal Reserve. Of course, remember I was arguing that the United States should shift its policy mix from the current what was called the Samuelson-Tobin neo-classical synthesis of lowering interest rates to expand growth and have a budget surplus to siphon off the inflationary effects of that. I was arguing this policy mix would move away from equilibrium. You had to reverse it completely. So it was subject to attack, couple of attacks from the Federal Reserve papers on that, so I decided then I had to underline the point very clearly and what I assumed in that IMF paper was there was some degree of capital mobility.
But in order to make my points more clearly in this more sharper framework, to respond to the criticisms from the Federal Reserve, I assumed perfect capital mobility. And then this is the model that some people consider the Mundell-Fleming, or my part of the Mundell-Fleming model. But actually the Mundell-Fleming model started in 1960 with those other papers I did, and it doesn’t matter so much whether you use a classical or a Keynesian framework for them because the structure is the same. You see, in a general equilibrium system, you have one set of assumptions of rigid prices and flexible output. In the other you have rigid output and flexible prices. And the isomorphism is there.";852;Creativity
This is very much the international background, but at that time in the world economy, most countries had fixed exchange rates, the Bretton Woods system, and also international mobility of capital was very low. Still, you emphasised the international capital mobility and the floating exchange [- – -] Where you influenced by the fact that you were a Canadian, that Canada had this somewhat special regime? Canada had the floating exchange rate from time to time and maybe capital mobility was higher also between Canada and the United States? Was your Canadian background important for your inspiration?;"I know that my Canadian background is important for both this and for the optimum currency areas framework. Definitely the fact that Canada had a system of the first country to have flexible exchange rates. It’s not really clear to many people, people don’t understand. I don’t think anyone’s ever told people why Canada has had flexible exchange rates. It had a fixed exchange rate and exchange controls in the late 1940’s. And then Britain in September 1949 devalued the pound 30% devaluation, to 2 dollars and 80 cents from 4 dollars and 3 cents. And Canada, the Canadian government for some reason, without any basic theory, devalued the Canadian dollar by 10%. The sort of idea is well we’re sort of in between Britain and the United States and we’re closer to the United States than we are to Britain economically, so we would go 20% or we would go 10%. But it was a mistake. A weighted average, exactly. Maybe a trade. But it was a mistake because there was nothing in the Canadian economy that said they should have devalued. But they did devalue.
But very soon after there was an influx of capital coming into Canada, then the Korean War broke out, raising the demand for Canadian products and raw materials. So Canada was engulfed with capital. What they should have done is just appreciate the Canadian dollar back to a parity where it was, but they couldn’t do that without appearing to have made a mistake in 1949. So they floated. And then they left this out and there was a big discussion with the IMF. And anyway, Canada had all through the 1950’s had a floating exchange rate. It didn’t float very much. It floated upwards. It went up to a premium against the Americans and then they had to talk it down and they had to … they didn’t like the way it was working and so they ended up going back to fixed rates. But I was definitely saying you needed a model to study flexible exchange rates. But what models existed to study? There is in the open economy there was the matrix multiplier type, two country multiplier and matrix multiplier type model, and these models had no monetary policy in them, they just assumed interest rate … and money wasn’t in it. And then there was this very good paper, excellent, very important paper by Laursen and Metzler which had two economies, two markets, goods and services markets and the balance of payment equilibrium with flexible exchange rates.
So that was the first model you had of a flexible exchange rate system, but it was in the context no money was in it, but you had flexible exchange rates and you … they have to be interpreted as real exchange rates. But it was a very ingenious paper and a very important paper. And that paper assumed no capital movements because they had controls over capital movements in the assumption in that paper. Well obviously, in the Canadian context that didn’t work, because after Canada had a floating exchange rate, after a while it took away its controls, there was no function to have … controls anymore And you had perfect capital mobility effectively between Canada and the United States except for the two currencies which always prevents an ideal situation from developing, you had capital that was completely free to move between Canada and the United States. So this was a natural IFM modelling, fixed or flexible exchange rates I model world of capital mobility. I agree with you, it was the … Canadian background there was quite important.";852;Life
You mentioned your other important contribution, the so-called theory of optimum currency areas. Instead of asking the question “Should a nation have floating for fixed exchange rates?” you re-formulated the question and said “In which areas should people chose, regardless of nation states, fixed, floating rates, or should they form a monetary union?” And of course this idea about monetary union has become more and more important over the years, and the most important development recently of course is the European Monetary Union has been established. Do you think this was a good idea to create the European Monetary Union? Your theory of optimum currency areas emphasised the importance of high labour mobility within an area that had a common currency. And many people believe that Europe does not yet have that kind of labour mobility. And many people think that Europe is not the optimum currency area by your definition. What is your reflection about that? What do you think about the idea of European Monetary Union?;"Yes, it just is for the background on that and the paper on optimum currency areas and the first paragraph I think ends with something to the effect that we talked about the argument for flexible exchange rates being based on money illusion etc., and then it said this paper casts doubt on one of the alternatives to adjusting the terms of trade through flexible exchange rates. And so this paper has to be looked upon as really a kind of criticism of flexible exchange rates and with the conclusion that unless currency areas were contiguous with regions defined by factor mobility. That was the point. So you can look at that in two ways. I was … here again the Canadian influence is important. I first gave that paper in 1957 at a faculty seminar at UBC British Columbia, and what I did was to argue that flexible exchange rates between Canada and the United States wouldn’t help British Columbia if there was a decline in demand for lumber products in here at terms of trade problems for British Columbia or something of that nature. Canada/US flexibility wouldn’t help. You’d have to have a separate currency for BC in order to apply … British Columbia, in order to apply the arguments for flexible exchange rates and that would be true in any country with multi-regions or with zones in the country of inflexibility.
So it was really the genesis of the paper was in large part that flexible exchange rates aren’t going to do what people think they’re going to do because in between Canada and the United States this wasn’t … and I still believe that it doesn’t really, it isn’t a good system between Canada and the United States and between other countries that have money regions. If you have flexible exchange rates between Italy and elsewhere it doesn’t help the problem between the North and South of Italy. It doesn’t help the problem in the different parts of Spain, the different parts … etc., etc. So you could if the argument for flexible exchange rates were really valid you really should separate countries up into smaller and smaller regions. The only trouble is that as you do that you lose more and more of the functions of money, and as the regions get smaller and smaller the basic argument for flexible exchange rates begins to break down because as the region gets smaller it becomes more open, and then you can no longer assume that workers have this money illusion that they’re going to not see the link between the exchange rate and domestic prices and their wage rates. So that was the argument.";852;Meaning(Values) of Work
So what will happen with the dollar now when you get the European currency? Will that out-compete the dollar in world economy or is dollar so strong that it will stay as a dominating currence in currency world?;"We have the short run aspects of this and the intermediate and long run aspects. The long run growth of the dollar area and the Euro area will depend in a large part on the growth of population in the economies. I can see certainly that right now you can think of the GDP area, the transactions area of the dollar is now about … US GDP’s about 9 trillion, and the EU 11 countries have a GDP of about 7 trillion, but as the other countries come into the Euroland, as Sweden and Britain, Denmark and Greece, and I think they will come in maybe three or four years, we don’t know, but I think they will come in, and as countries in central and eastern Europe start joining either by currency boards or coming completely into the Union, by the year in 12 years time that Euroland is going to be considerably larger than the dollar area of the United States itself. Now of course the dollar area is likely to grow because there’s a growing movement in Latin America to link some more currencies to the dollar, just as the Euro area is going to grow. But certainly in getting up to say a dozen years from now, you can imagine that most central banks would want to hold their assets about evenly balanced between Euros and dollars.
So there’s going to be a big demand if you get to that steady state of equilibrium, a big annual demand for Euros because the euro is very underweight in terms of portfolios of all around the world, compared to what the equilibrium certainly will be in a few years. So you could imagine a demand, an annual demand for Euros even with no growth of dollars of something like 50 or 100 billion dollars every year and this is going to have a big impact on exchange rates, that is going to add greatly to the strength of the euro against the dollar.";852;Career Development
Professor Robert Merton, very welcome to this interview. It’s a pleasure to have you with us. Today during your speech you outlined something that I found very interesting. You were saying that households and individuals have had, over the last couple of years, to take much more serious economic decisions about how their, for example, pensions would look like in the future and so on. Would you please tell us a little bit more about what the consequences have been and what consequences you foresee in the future, for example for households and financial institutions?;"The trend has been, starting now in the Anglo-Saxon world but moving really to the rest of the world, as the ageing has taken place and retirement and pensions and so forth have become a much bigger issue. Recognizing that the structures that are used in the past, either from the Government or from corporations, of funding pensions in particular, have been just too costly. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with them, it’s just it wasn’t recognized how expensive they were. So there’s been a move really over the last I would say 20 years of putting more and more responsibility on households to make major financial decisions; decisions that they hadn’t had to make in the past. Decisions that they’re not equipped to make at the moment, and with all respect for most households, I don’t think they could be expected to become educated to make them in the future. Very much like you wouldn’t ask people to perform their own medical services.
You know you can’t get something from nothing …
And as a consequence of that I see a shift, a trend, that’s going to, I think, come, in which you’re going to move from this sort of separate pieces, that everybody is asked to assemble their own financial plan or financial coverage, to more integrated solutions that are simpler for us to understand and do what we really want as individuals to do that. Now in particular, when you see the baby boomers coming to retirement, they’re going to discover, many of them, that they do not have, with the combination of social security and their private savings, they will not have adequate savings in order to generate an annuity, which is what will look after them in retirement, adjusted for inflation, so that they don’t have to give up their lifestyle as they age, that would be adequate to cover that. You know you can’t get something from nothing.
But one /- – -/ use of modern financial technology would be to develop instruments that get the most of what people do have for them. And one such instrument would be reverse mortgages. What that essentially allows the owner, who has accumulated wealth in their house, but wants to keep to live in as part of their living style, an opportunity to in effect be able to continue to live in their house throughout their retirement until their death, with no fear of being evicted because they couldn’t repay the loans, but to be able to borrow out a substantial part of the value of the house and use that to purchase additional annuities so that they could live at a higher level. That’s one such example.
Another would be combining treatment for long-term care and a life annuity in one package. And it just turns out, without getting too technical about it, that if someone has the need for long-term care, they’re less likely to live as long, so by providing both contracts the provider, the insurance company or the corporate provider, can reduce its risk and therefore charge a lower fee than if they were sold separately. So we keep looking for use of financial innovations as a way to address in this case the retirement part of the lifecycle, but really to apply it throughout the lifecycle that all people in all places go through.";854;Research
Could this be a way of reducing the risk in a way? I mean people have been quite upset, if you look at Sweden, for example. We’re only now starting to realize that a large group of us will not have a pension that we thought we would have, because things have shifted and we were forced or made to believe that we had to make certain decisions. Do you think the risk for the individual will be less?;"My hope, what I’m trying to build, so of course it’s not finished yet, but which I think is quite feasible within the technology, is to develop instruments, tools, programmes and contracts that will make it possible for individuals to have a relatively risk-free economic retirement.
Does it mean that financial institutions need to become more risk-prone or more ethical about the way they do business, for example? You know who’s going to change here?
Robert Merton: I think part of it is the development of technology and more efficient allocation of resources, which doesn’t require beyond that that either party gives something up. I think on the case of the institutions – they will have to work harder. They will either have to be more creative or they’ll have to be at more risk or find ways to get risk-borne. From an economist’s point of view that makes sense. It’s much more sensible to expect institutions to find a more efficient way to distribute risk than to impose it on the individual person. So, I think we can make definite improvements there by moving in that direction. The ethical nature of things of course in every field and every profession sadly there aren’t ethical things. But I think for the most part people who work in the financial services industry are really trying to do a good job and do the right thing.
You made a likeness between a car manufacturer, and you know you just can’t have a car which has one door and looks the same color. So the financial institutions are going to have to be more, as you said, more innovative.
Robert Merton: Yes, as it is now the institutions, by leaving the risk and the decision on the individual household, make life simpler for themselves, because the household’s taking much more of the risk and they don’t have to make the kinds of commitments. It opens it up, therefore, for many more people to be advisors on finance, because you don’t really have to take that commitment. It is clearly more complex for the producer, so there’s a kind of paradox. The easier, simpler to understand and more comfortable you make it for your customer, the more complex you make it for yourself.
And in the case of an automobile analogy, you know it’s easier to make one door on a car rather than four, and if you produce all cars the same color you don’t have to have as complex a painting choice or anything. But of course that doesn’t take account of the needs of the actual customer. And in this industry, as well as the auto industry and the other industries, I think in the end they will find competitively they will have to do what’s right for the customer. So, there is greater complexity, but I think on the whole it’s a more efficient and effective system, and I really am quite hopeful that significant improvements will be made. And I wouldn’t leave this by saying that over the last 20 years in many ways there have been very great improvements in what is offered in the financial services. It’s just that there’s been this underlying trend of putting more responsibility on the household for things that they really aren’t in a position to make good decisions about.";854;Creativity
I just want to go back a little bit in time and ask you something about your childhood, because you said you were looking forward all the time. When did you realize that you had a very good sense for economy and finance and, you know, the maths around it? Did you know that already as a child? I read somewhere that you liked baseball and you didn’t really care that much for maths?;"Well, I liked math as my academic subjects. But you’re quite right, I think as a child I did the minimum amount of work I had to do in school; with the exception really of math – I enjoyed really. I liked baseball and other things. At the same time, when I was a pretty young age, I used to create fictitious companies, including a fictitious bank. I think it was called the RCM Dollars and Savings Company, of which I went and tried to get deposits and make investments. And at a relatively early age, ten or so, I invested my first share of stock. And I used to follow, look at companies and so forth. But throughout the whole period, and indeed right through my college years, while I was involved in the stock market, always interested in finance, I never thought of it as a full-time job. You know I always thought that was something for after hours. And it was really fairly late in my graduate study that I decided actually to move into economics.
I read somewhere that you said you wanted to do something that really mattered?
Robert Merton: That was a big factor in my decision. As an undergraduate at Columbia, I went to the engineering school, I had a great deal of training in engineering and mathematics as well as subdiversified training. And then I went to the California Institute of Technology to do my PhD in applied math. And I went there and I took all the courses I needed and passed my qualifying exams. So I was really making a decision about doing research for my dissertations. So I finally came to the point where I really had to focus on what I was going to do. And I found myself … two things happening: One: I was following the stock market and doing things before hours – not interfering with my studies but doing that.
And the other is I started to look at the range of problems that people were working on, using mathematics and the applied fields, and it ranged from plasma physics problems to water waves in a tank and fluid mechanics. And none of those really excited me too much. This was also in 1967, so middle-late part of the ’60s. And we had had the view, at least we – I was not in a congress at the time – that we had solved macroeconomic problems; that we had the Council of Economic Advisors and under Kennedy and then Johnson there was a sense that we really had solved macro problems. And I looked at that and said, you know, “If you could do something in the field of economics,” which intrigued me anyway, “you might have an influence, even if you did a little something, on an awful lot of people.” And that’s exciting. And so there was a combination of a sense that you really could do something, and then my idea that I sort of had a feel for the stock markets and things of that sort – economics, I had this mathematics training.
… there was a bit of serendipity or a bit of luck, I guess you would put it …
And then I’ll confess there was a bit of serendipity or a bit of luck, I guess you would put it, I read a book on mathematical economics. I can’t remember the author and as you’ll see it’s good that I can’t. And I decided it was so terrible that I thought even I, if I went into this field with my mathematics, could probably do something. Had I read Robert Solow‘s or Paul Samuelson‘s mathematical works I might never have come into the field. So, it was a combination of all that that I made this complete break where I left Caltech, I applied to a number of economics departments, who of course I had no economics. All but one turned me down. The one that accepted me was MIT, which most would say was the best department in the world at that time. And they gave me a full fellowship so my decision was easy. And then I went to MIT.";854;Family/Home Environment
Did your parents influence you? I know that your father is a highly acclaimed academic and I believe your mother also is in the academic field. In which way did they influence you? I’m sure in some way or another.;"Well of course. I mean as we all have happen, being in a household with 10,000 books and things going on you absorb things that are not … But I think in the case of my father, in terms of the things that influenced me, he never pressed me to go into academics or pressed me to go to a field, and indeed my behavior was largely to move as far the other direction. I don’t think that’s uncommon with people with very successful parents. And so for a long time I think what I really absorbed from him was a sense of a work ethic; a sense that if you are going to do something it should be of top quality. And of course he being in a major academic environment, he himself being very eminent in a field, it just seemed standards that were set. I mean I was very comfortable. I met Nobel Laureates and their equivalents in the other fields and just, you know, listened. So there was that as background.
In my mother’s case she taught me something, and one thing I often repeat to people is she gave me the dictum that I should do it their way, whoever they are who set standards, and do it so well that there’s no question that I could do exactly what they were asking. And then once I did that, I had the right to do it my way. And I, to some degree, followed that for a good part of my life. But of course later my mother died, about 15 years ago, my father died last year, but my father and I were, you might say, best friends for the last 40 years. So we interacted; almost did some joint research.
He must have been very proud when you were given the prize?
Robert Merton: Oh yes. And he was very happy. In fact he came to Stockholm with all of the rest of my family, but he was my significant other at the table. And he was very happy and he always signed his letters, even before the prize, as the ‘father of the economist’. I would sign as the ‘son of the sociologist’.";854;Mentors (Role models)
How did you react when you got a phone call?;"That’s a question there. I was actually leaving my apartment for an early flight to New York and the phone rang. And as we often do, the first moment was, “I better not answer it because I’ll be late for the plane.” Then I said, “Oh, I’d better answer it, you know, say I’m rushing.” Well of course when the phone came and they said who they were and they said they had some interesting news for me I never left my apartment, I missed the plane. But after getting it I guess I just sat down. The phone started ringing and I quickly stopped answering. And I started thinking about it and it was just, you know, unbelievable. I guess the only feeling that came to mind was I said, “Well now I’m going to have to be a little more careful what I say, because I go downstairs now and whatever I say will be all over the world. And if it’s something really dumb it’s going to really reflect not on me only but also on my institution. It’s going to cost the Nobel Foundation.” And the committee had made their decision. So I felt a little more responsible of what I had to give when I said things.
Did you restrict yourself?
Robert Merton: Oh, not really. It was the thought, but no, I think I felt a certain additional responsibility – it also created some – because people might actually listen.";854;Impact of the Nobel on you
The fields of economics is often to people from the outside very theoretical, but really it’s about daily life. How is it possible to translate theory into daily life and explain it? You know it’s so much part of our lives. How do you go about it when you meet people who might not have any knowledge when you explain a theoretical problem?;Well, as in every field there are some problems that only someone in the field can find interest in. They really are very technical. However, at the main stream of things, I think one should really be able to explain what’s interesting and what’s important about just about every aspect of economics. The trick is to find out the background of the person you’re talking to and try to find a frame of reference. But if you really do understand the problems and what they’re about I think there’s no reason at all that you can’t explain. At least the substance of it and why it’s important. The execution may be more difficult to explain.;854;Motivation
Has it helped you to move in these two worlds? I mean, you’ve done both academic work and you’ve done a lot of more practical work one could say as well, as a consultant, for example. How important is that, to be able to move between these two?;"It turns out from a professional and a personal point of view it’s been very important. As it happens, although I was at MIT on the faculty full-time for 18 years and then at Harvard for another 16, so I’ve always been in full-time an academia, I always found it was both beneficial for my research and beneficial for the other work to be involved in the practicing community. And I did some serious consulting when I was still a graduate student, but certainly within a year or two of my becoming a faculty member I became involved in practicing a very material way. And I could show in fact in the paper that was cited for the prize on option pricing, in that paper is a section I did which was an application of the technology we had developed to a thing called the “down-and-out” option, which was pretty esoteric. But it’s turned out subsequently to be the prototype for a whole industry called exotic options, which are used all over the world and have been.
I wouldn’t have known of the existence of that contract to put in my research paper, let alone solve it, how to price it and so forth, if I hadn’t been involved in practice. So there really has been a feedback that, as a theorist the art of the science is making judgments about the abstraction from complex realities. When you build a model the world looks very complicated, so you have to simplify. And it’s the art of how you simplify which I think, to a large extent, influences how people see your models and what you have developed. And I felt the confidence in my abstractions that – in the area I was working – that as a consequence of my being involved in practice I felt the confidence of being able to say, “This abstraction’s okay. This is close enough to reality, this is the way it really happens. This isn’t.” And that, in no one specific case but as building the whole mosaic of models that you build and how you explain them and what’s an interesting problem, I felt very influenced by having the practice.
On the more personal level it was stimulating to be working with world-class minds in academia; MIT, Harvard, you know, University of Chicago and so forth. And then be able to in some sense change clothes and go from Cambridge to New York, which is not a long distance in space, and be involved with very intelligent, interesting and motivated and talented people of a very different sort. And the combination of that just from a personal point of view is quite stimulating and still is.";854;Career Devleopment
That’s lovely. I just want to pass on the question about the third world and the developing world, which is really a continuation of what you’ve said. They have been going about financing and building up in a very old-fashioned way, taking risks that have not been at all profitable and of course having been so badly hit by war and conflict and natural disasters. But how do you see the developing world making the leapfrog, because it’s certainly there, the natural resources, the human resources? The capacity is enormous and yet they are so far behind.;"Of course it’s a great challenge and to sit here and suggest it’ll all take care of itself would be not the case. But that said, if we measure it in relative terms, relative to where we have been and what the opportunities or hope might be for the future, in my area of finance the new technologies, this new way of doing things, of being able to really much more efficiently distribute risk, to find ways which we’ve evolved of stripping risk and separating from the other qualities, of investment projects or a variety of other economic activities – gives us the opportunity to allow these countries to develop better the resources they have, because they can in effect take more risks, not for themselves because, that’s one of the problems – they are not rich enough, wealthy enough, to be able to take much risk – so therefore you know that’s where the rather poor, low return opportunities. The hope here is they’re being able to distribute the risk elsewhere in the world, which it should be. Very much analogist to what I discussed moments ago about the households.
There are better ways to distribute lots of the risk than to impose them all on these smaller countries. So if we find ways, and there are ways, to distribute it that gives the opportunities for them to develop their resources, which inherently may have more risks, but they can shed them efficiently, and also have with them somewhat higher returns; that’s one element. A second element is on the ongoing basis it’s possible to substitute for the very concentrated risks, which are inherent in a small country. I mean there are only typically one or two major industries that can be developed or sources, whether it’s agriculture or natural resources, oil even, that you can now get rid of those risks, those concentrated risks, while retaining the good parts of developing what are the comparative advantages in those countries? You could say, “What’s different now?” Some technological difference. If you look at how countries, developing countries and certainly third world countries, get financed at all, it’s been done by bank loans, it’s also been done by governments and World Bank support and so forth, but to the extent you have private sector financing it’s almost all been done by banks. It’s been done as a consortium and it’s typically been loans, loans in some foreign currency. Typically short-term loans, which is a prescription frankly for disasters. You know that may have been the best way to do it at the time, but it sets up a situation for a crises.
The idea here is by bringing financial technology, opening up the financial world, all the kinds of these new technologies /- – -/, financial contracts as we call them, and so forth that are papers, derivatives and so forth, is it offers a multiple chance to these countries for getting rid of risks and for getting investment. So if one of the channels is clogged or something goes wrong with its banks, they have other channels; they’re not shut off. Every country will benefit by development of this financial technology, but the smaller developing countries and the poorer countries actually will, I believe, benefit disproportionately because it gives them a potential seat at the table. Now it’s true they need education – not of everyone, I mean education of people to be able to make use of these markets. But that’s feasible. There is no reason at all that these countries can’t have the best that they have.
I know the World Bank used to have a programme, which I think they still do, where they train them in how to deal with this. So you know it does require education. But the opportunity, the idea of having a place at the table of the world capital markets, without only being able to go through indirectly through the one channel which are banks, I think you know holds great hope in my mind. And so in a way it’s going to be inevitable that at least the first beneficiaries of a lot of the technology are the more developed countries, because that’s where the resources are, but ultimately I think the incremental percentage benefits are going to be much greater for these smaller countries and that’s really a hope in my mind. It’s a hope but it’s a hope with some reason to be hopeful.";854;Research
I just want to start off with some memories from 1996, the day that you were told that you were to receive the Economy Prize. What were your thoughts? I don’t know whether the telephone rang or whether you were told in a different way, but what do you think? Was it a huge surprise?;"So the telephone rang and I got the message. And I politely suggested that it didn’t sound very likely and I needed some proof. But fortunately Assar Lindbeck was there too, so there was somebody I knew who could actually tell me it was true. So I thought it was very surprising. That was the first thought. Then I suppose I kind of wondered what was going to be the little problems of the day that followed from all of that. Was I going to be able to get away from journalists?
And were you? Not really.
James Mirrlees: No, I really didn’t try to. But Cambridge wasn’t awfully good at organising things. I did have a little press conference with some journalists, but most of them who wanted to get in touch with me were unable to do so, because I was somewhere else when they were trying to get hold of me.
You quietly disappeared somewhere.
James Mirrlees: They got me into the wrong place really and we weren’t very good at communicating around the place. Difficult to organise. But then I decided it was really quite a nice feeling. I was appreciated in a way I didn’t think I was. So it was nice to know my work seemed actually to be worthwhile.";856;The impact of nobel on you
Has it changed your working life in the sense that you are now demanded to answer questions about all sorts of problems that have to do with world economy?;Occasionally, but I’m not usually asked by people who really need to know the answers. I suppose I haven’t been quite that kind of economist on the whole. But I find I have to give a lot of lectures on general topics to a much more general audience than I was ever used to talk to. And you feel an obligation to do that kind of thing. And you have to think about problems that are seen by ordinary people as really major economic problems, but on which I haven’t done professional work. It’s been quite a challenge and it’s also quite interesting a lot of the time.;856;Impact of the Nobel on you
I read that you were very good at maths as a child, but it wasn’t a straight road. You were also taking philosophy at university and you were interested in developmental issues, and you certainly liked, I read, to supervise research of the students that you worked with, you know. What was your main driving force during this development from your student years and forward? What was the main driving force for you?;"I suppose that I wanted to know everything. It must have been something like that; a sort of a lot of curiosity. So that wasn’t just curiosity to explain things, but curiosity to know what people had said. So I spent an awful lot of time reading in that period.
The force for that was just because one of the advantages of the Scottish university system is you do some subjects beside your major subject. And I did that and some English literature and some physics, although mathematics was the major subject. So I’ve the sense that somehow going through Edinburgh, looking back, I should really have been trying to do some serious mathematics research then. But I didn’t, I just enjoyed doing the mathematics and learning more about it. So a lot of the time it was just learning. And then somehow in Cambridge there was this immense shift of deciding that I didn’t quite see the direct point of mathematics, at least for me, then. So I wanted to do something that I thought would be more useful.
And then I really got this feeling that there were problems I wanted to solve …
And I’m sure I must also have felt that it would be more interesting. And then I really got this feeling that there were problems I wanted to solve, I really wanted to do new things. And that I suppose was because there are just one or two papers I read that seemed to have a tremendous excitement about them. They would pose a problem, an interesting problem, and could actually solve it. They just seemed lovely examples of how you can get a fresh thought; something you would have no idea that you could really say anything sensible about. And one of them was about optimal taxes, which is what I then got very interested in professionally to run.";856;Family/Home Environment
I know that you went to India. That was a sidetrack maybe. But what did it give you, because you have said that you wanted to do something useful and something new, and at that time there was this whole idea of helping the developing world to greater economy, to, you know, narrow the gap?;"Yes. It became clear I wanted to be a development economist. I mean I said I wanted to work on the economics of poor countries. And I’d actually say that I don’t think that was so much about narrowing the gap as about increasing their incomes, which means economic growth, which is really my prime interest. So it was very fortunate that I was able to go to India. It was arranged for me by Amartya Sen, who’s also a Nobel Prize Winner, because we knew one another at that stage. And I was just a research student, he was a young research fellow but he had these contacts. And it was a marvellous opportunity to have to do with the Planning Commission there. I didn’t feel that it was entirely useful for them, because I suppose I had a real sense that I didn’t know quite what to do.
Looking back I don’t quite know why that should have been so. But you know there’s problems, you can see all the poverty and so on, but it’s quite another matter to know what you can do about it. And some people are rather good at knowing that. But anyway I wasn’t. And I spent a lot of the year really trying to think my way through to that.
And I think it worked quite well, because I suppose I decided that the main issue was how people should decide what to do sort of rather indirect, and got into the idea that instead of planning you should have a systematic way of deciding what kind of new projects to start. In other words a much more piecemeal thing, much more like Western economy. Which at that stage in India was not. India thought that you could actually deal with economic problems by building a model and then seeing what it said you should do and doing it.
And it didn’t really work did it?
James Mirrlees: No, no. No, you can’t just say do this and it happens. Or it may happen in a much too expensive and wasteful way. But it actually took me a while to really understand how wasteful the whole process was.";856;Meaning(Values) of Work
There has to be incentives for people to pay tax somehow. When I look at the optimal taxation model, the idea is that you need to feel that you’re getting something back you know so that you actually pay, if I’m not simplifying it too much. Would you just tell us a little bit about the way you see the taxation system? From that point of view it may be forwards. You know where are we today, the so-called Western world? And certainly not all people feel that they are you know wanting to pay as much tax because they don’t feel they’re getting back what they should get.;"Yes, I suppose that there are lots of excuses about tax and I know it makes people rather unhappy.
I suppose that I’m forced to see that high tax rates do induce quite a lot of people to find ways of avoiding them …
When I had the sort of little film interview that they do after the prize as part of a general film, the cameraman on that occasion said to me as we were walking across the court in Trinity, “Since the taxes you pay are going to be spent on things that the Government does, which are good things like the health service and education and so on which you surely value too, doesn’t that mean that you should be very happy to pay taxes and there should be no incentive problem?” So I thought that was a nice argument and I liked it and I wish that people felt like that about taxes. But of course the work I’ve done has mainly been recognising that people do not feel like that about taxes and that it apparently even got to the point of discouraging quite a lot of people from earning as much as they might have, which in particular I mean they no longer pay as many taxes as they should. I suppose that I’m forced to see that high tax rates do induce quite a lot of people to find ways of avoiding them, or evading them.
And I think that’s also part of it. In the Western countries, still the total tax take is pretty high and I think on the whole it’s going up again in most countries. And that’s for perfectly straightforward reasons that more and more is needed for things that, at least in Europe, the state does, like education, which is necessarily something that gets more expensive, and very notable in Britain the health service. The rate at which we spend on health is going up a great deal, and I think that’s pretty much the picture in the European countries as well. And actually I’m not as concerned as lots of people are about the marginal tax rates which they think are quite high. I think in effect in most of the European countries the total marginal tax rate is over 50 percent; that’s to say add on other taxes like VAT to the income tax. So yes, people are paying rather a large proportion of their income above the basic to the Government to use for this and that. But I suppose I don’t quite understand why they don’t think they’re getting a lot of it back, because actually a lot of the benefits do accrue to the better off as well. And then there are lots and lots of people in the country who are not so well off. And I would think clearly a majority of the population are getting or can expect to get more out of the system than they’re putting in on taxation. So I think that’s what it’s about. It’s about ensuring that the things that are needed for everybody, certain basic things which cannot be conveniently left to people to buy for themselves, should be available for everyone, but they are mainly going to have to be paid for by the better off.";856;Research
How do you see the issue around the ageing population in the Western world, and the fear that there will not be enough tax coming in to actually pay for pension schemes and for the care of the older population and so on and so forth, including education and all the other things that we are used to that the state would provide for the population in general?;"Yes. I mean certainly for the main continental European countries there is quite a big issue there. I suppose I believe it’s a bit exaggerated because economic output, which is what we are needing here, gets created by capital as well as by people, and that’s even true of things like medical services and to some extent of education. So that you need workers of course but you also need other things like capital. And so you can ensure that there is more output available in due course by building up capital by saving.
So I do think that these demographic changes imply that it’s rather important for the European economies to do more saving. And indeed some of them have moved over to doing that, but I think not rapidly enough; they’re not doing enough of that. And some of the birth rates are really remarkably low. And this will have a variety of effects. What people are worrying about now is the period when there will be a lot of retired people and not all that many people working. I must say that I still think while people might find themselves, an average person, might be paying nearly half their income over taxes and so on, that’s very different from paying 90 percent. And when you think what it’s being paid for, health, education and pensions, these seem rather valuable things.
Well of course.
James Mirrlees: So I think it’s a little strange people should be quite so troubled about that. But of course this is against the backdrop of a situation where these European economies have not been growing very fast. Incomes have been rising a little but not a lot. I’d like to be able to say, “Well, you know maybe what’s going to happen is that the workers in 20 years time will not be able to spend more on current consumption than the workers today can do.” Which after all isn’t bad. And I think it should be close to that. In other words, people will be spending more of their income on taxes in order to pay the current pensions. And that part will grow quite a lot. So they look at the proportion and so on. So I suppose I think that people should look back and think that you know ‘Why should I be spending more on consumption than my parents,’ who were probably pretty happy with it.";856;Meaning(Values) of Work
But is there a lack of dialogue, maybe, between politicians who are now forced to make the savings and, you know, more opportunistic politicians, maybe, who rather, you know, use people’s fear? I mean it’s difficult to discuss these issues, because they are quite complex and rather, you know, people are really just looking into their own pockets and not seeing the bigger picture.;"Yes, and yet in a way I think people may sense what’s at issue here. Suppose you were to increase savings substantially, this would be a way of putting down people’s consumption now, like increase the taxes now rather than have them in the future. And probably people have a sense that that’s what’s at issue. And you shouldn’t always think of things in terms of proportions. It’s just absolutely saying, “Ah, now it looks as though the current generation should now cut its standard of living significantly in order that its children should in the future be able to enjoy a standard of living, consumption level …, probably quite a bit higher than the current generation.” And I say that partly because I actually think that the rate of economic growth is going to accelerate again. It’s not going to stay at 1½ percent.
You are fairly positive?
James Mirrlees: Yes, I don’t see why not. I mean there are some problems I know, but that’s partly looking at the overall picture of the European economies where I mean in an area like where we’re sitting now, which is pretty much the centre of a rather large circle where unemployment is low and economic growth is going on quite well, it’s just there are these other regions where it’s not. And it’s a very interesting question as to why say Western France, Southern Italy, Northern, Eastern Germany are performing quite badly.";856;Research
If we look at the world at large, we have this idea, although we see problems, that economic growth is possible, it will continue. But if you look at the world at large, the amount of natural resources is limited for example. Can we expect a continued growth though, I mean if you look at the whole picture? What is necessary?;"It’s very interesting to look at it like that, and I think it wouldn’t be a bad idea if somebody were to try to picture what the pattern of our consumption might be likely to be towards the end of the century, certainly because of the limits on the natural resources. We should be doing much less travelling then or our grandchildren should be. You know planes should become very expensive because they’re using fuel. I dare say that there will methods brought in. But things like heating and air-conditioning and so on I’m sure we’ll be able to deal with by other methods other than hydrocarbons.
… I think it wouldn’t be a bad idea if somebody were to try to picture what the pattern of our consumption might be likely to be towards the end of the century …
Transport I suspect will get quite a lot more expensive. So we will spend our time in different ways. I think perhaps more holidays at home or closer to home again. And since we think of going away to the other side of the world for our holidays as somehow characteristic of the world we’ve moved into we may think this is a great loss. It’s a loss, but there are going to be other tremendous compensations; I don’t see why not. Certainly resources will put some limit on it. Of course I’m aware I remember a paper that I wrote years ago with a friend on natural resources. We remarked on how there had been all these tremendous concerns about how Britain was going to be in a pretty bad way because it soon run out of trees. And what will we do then? Of course that was just as economic growth was beginning and it turned out that it was no issue. Now, one of these times this sort of typical economist’s optimism will prove to be unjustified. The world’s been pretty good at coming up with new ways of doing things.The need will create new disciplines, new ideas, new questions to solve. Do you see …
James Mirrlees: Well, yes and it has done that and in a way it’s a little mysterious what’s happened. Like we would have thought by now that probably fusion energy would be generating most of our electricity and so on, and it hasn’t happened at all and there’s really no prospect that it will. So things are not going the way we might have expected. But I still believe they will.";856;Menaing of Work
Eventually, yes. If you were a young economist today, or you were to advise a person to go into this field, what to look at to be very busy? What would you if you were to start afresh again?;"I would think of different things each day more or less because I think I don’t have a persistent large vision about what exactly one should do. But it seems to me that the way that we reason, and how that leads to what we do, which sounds more like psychology than economics, but it’s a very economic kind of activity and this involves the sort of information we get from others. I think that as yet we have not found good ways of measuring that and recording that objectively.
So I really believe that the development of theories or models, whichever way you want to call it, of human behaviour is just beginning, and that there’s a lot of scope, both empirically in doing descriptive measurement of things of a kind that people have simply not done up to now – the way we form expectations and the way we work out our decisions, that’s just desperately needing to be done. And there’s actually a tremendous intellectual challenge in connecting these up with issues of economic policy … interested in about how taxes operate, how people respond to them, how we think about issues, the sort that you’ve been raising earlier.";856;Motivation
It has passed ten years since you received the Economics Prize. What impact has it had on your professional and maybe on your private life over the last ten years?;Well, it’s almost ten years. It has had a tremendous impact on my life, more than on the life of most Prize winners because I was in an unusual situation. I was unemployed at the time. I was in good health, but I had reached the age of 66 and beginning to get social security, but I didn’t have much of that, I had many years of unemployment before me. And so I was in a position to be very much influenced by the recognition of my earlier work came about in this way. I had become widely known, but in a sense it wasn’t officially recognised. I was quoted very frequently in the literature of economics and mathematics, but it’s quite different to get official recognition. It transformed my life.;860;Impact of the Nobel on you
Do you have any special memories from the time, -94, when you went to Stockholm to receive the Prize? Anything particular that you would like to share with us?;I have many memories, but I don’t know what I should say. It was very remarkable to be in Stockholm in December. It’s when the days are getting very short and I was there for St Lucia’s Day, which is where there’s a little premature celebration of returning light. It’s ten days early in fact. But you could see in the afternoon it began getting dark around three o’clock and so that was really a phenomenon that I had not observed before at lower latitudes.;860;Impact of Nobel prize on you
You said in your speech, I believe, or maybe it was later in your biography, that you were hoping, by having now the age of 66, that you would achieve much more professionally. Do you feel that you have had the opportunity and the time to do that, or have your time been mainly taken up by giving lectures or travelling around, being a celebrity?;"Much of my time has been taken up in that way, but I have been making progress in the other sense. I haven’t completed so much. I have a paper published on ideal money, which I hope to follow up with another paper extending the ideas, and I really feel I’ve just discovered a … It’s hard to describe it … There has been a deterioration in the quality of money that’s observable in many areas, and it brings up questions. Like you could see how money is different all of a sudden in Italy when they had the lire and now they have the euro. So they, in a revolutionary way, have gone from bad money to good money comparatively. But what about the rest of the world?
Even the dollar has some questions around today.
John Nash: Oh yes, It’s not what it was. The dollar used to be a gold standard currency. And the dollar is really good in the last century, I mean in the 19th century.";860;Career Devleopment
I find this very fascinating what you’re talking about. What are the reasons for this, would you say, that the quality of money has sort of changed?;"Well, it’s complicated. I think we might get into too much deep water here … And I don’t want to compete with Professor Mundell in this media. I’m going to be listening to him and learning things when he lectures.
That’s a fascinating subject.
John Nash: Oh yes. And I have other areas of research I’m about to publish and my work really relates to game theory, a project … and I have other areas of study. I don’t know how long I will live and how much I will be able to do, but at least I am active.";860;Diversity in sicence
I was thinking that, when you were a child … I have spoken to some of the Prize winners over the last couple of years, and many of them were not at all interested in the subject that they finally got very deep into. How was it for you? Were you very interested in maths, for example? Did you feel that you have a special gift for that?;"I did have an appreciation of maths and science as a child, and even at elementary school I would like to do more in mathematics than the other students were doing in one way or another. So I did have that at an early stage. Like maybe almost comparable to Mozart in music. Of course he had a father who was a musician
Was that recognised at an early stage in your case, your special gift and your talent?
John Nash: It’s recognised … my parents realised that I was mentally special and of course things developed. Where I lived the school system wasn’t really adapted for special students and so there wasn’t much to do except you go through that and then go on … from the town.";860;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Do you think it’s better now that there are maybe special schools for specially talented children so that one can really give them what they need?;"There are many complicated issues coming into education. I don’t know that I want to express an opinion. You have to have education in different locations. You have the cities and you have the smaller areas that present different problems. The students can reach the level that they need to reach ultimately, and sometimes if they try to go into it too early, though they might, then they don’t do so well finally.  So I don’t know if it matters so much. Of course the American education system is very inefficient in many ways compared to other countries in Europe or Japan, but it works in such a way that at least the few people who are going onto unusual careers and science can manage to get into that even though they go through an earlier stage that doesn’t give them much.
Could almost be seen as a waste of time for some?
John Nash: Oh, it is. It’s like baby sitters … Sort of like you have kindergarten when it should be the elementary school.";860;Life
You were very young when you made your discovery that you were given the Prize for. What was the breakthrough for you when you were looking into that problem and, briefly, how did you realise what you were achieving at the time?;"Well, there were special circumstances with regard to what’s called the Nash equilibrium, and that’s the main /- – -/ topic.  I happened to be a graduate student in Princeton and von Neumann and Morgenstern were residents of Princeton, and they had written the book, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, which in turn depended on some earlier work in France, Emile Borel, and then going back even to people like Pierre de Fermat and Pascal and who studied probabilities. And so I had the opportunity to describe something different from the procedure that von Neumann and Morgenstern, and I wrote it up, but I could use much of their ideas, their concept of strategies and utility, part of which in themselves they had been adopted from previous study by Borel, and so I could develop this thing which was first called ‘Equilibrium Points in N-person Games’ and then, ‘Non-Cooperative Games’ was my final thesis title.
So it was very fortunate that I happened to be in that location. There was a seminar at the university that was concerned with work relating to the work of von Neumann and Morgenstern. So everything went together and I had also some other work relating to economics which linked in. This is what you call the bargaining problem, and that is also important, but it wasn’t cited for the Nobel Prize because I was linked with also with Harsanyi and Selten in the Prize and they were linked mostly with the equilibrium concept and everyone would think that Harsanyi also had done work in the bargaining cooperative games and Selten has done work in the experimental games. And he would talk on that here in this meeting.
id you realise at the time how big this discovery was?
I knew I had a good idea that was well worth publishing …
John Nash: I knew I had a good idea that was well worth publishing and it sort of expanded von Neumann and Morgenstern’s zero-sum game, which of course von Neumann himself had done originally. But it’s hard to know what would come of something, how the future would be, and of course as far as the Nobel Prize at that time there was nothing in economics that one couldn’t look forward to there. So that in -68 you started those, so that is entirely a matter of the fortunes of history.";860;Creativity
If you were to give advice to young students today, what fields should they look into if they are interested in economics?;"With regard to the specific sub-fields of economics, I don’t know so well. I can observe the game theory is applied very much in economics. Generally, it would be wise to get into the mathematics as much as seems reasonable because the economists who use more mathematics are somehow more respected than those who use less. That’s the trend.
I don’t think exactly like a professional economist. I think about economics and economic ideas, but somewhat like an outsider. Of course von Neumann was not an economist but Morgenstern was, and they teamed together on that book. Otherwise there are a lot of trends in economics. What seems fashionable now and the general opinion might be quite different after 20 years or so. Somebody studying a career they should be prepared for changes. I think they should learn things that are good foundations but don’t necessarily depend on a current fashion or what could be considered general opinion or popular opinion. You should maybe try to learn things that would be good for all time.  Unquestionable scientific value.";860;Motivation
Are there any issues in the world today that you are concerned of? For example, if we look at the disparity between the first so called First World and Third World. If we look at the political situation and what comes with it, for example, the US budget deficit, and its reasons for that … Are there any of those issues that concerns you as a scientist and that you give extra thought?;"You mentioned some different things here like the question of the First World, Third World and what happened to the Second World? The US budget, those are quite different topics.
Certainly they are. There’s a broad span.
John Nash: I think they require different doctors to deal with them.
Is there anything that you are particularly concerned of or …?
John Nash: Well, these are popular themes, but you find something that people are talking about and you may find that there are differing opinions. There’s the most widely held opinion, but there are maybe some other opinion that is more scientific or more subtle. It is easy to say that there are the rich and the poor and so something should be done. But in history there are always the rich and the poor. If the poor were not as poor we would still call them the poor. I mean whoever has less can be called the poor. You will always have the 10% that have less and the 10% that have the most. But maybe comparatively they’re not so bad.
Man has existed for much longer than has this technology.
I was thinking about these things when I saw India for the first time. I think it was last year in January 2003, when driving through the countryside of India I could see areas where presumably the amount of recognised income, personal income, would be very low. But this gave me the thought, comparatively one sort of peasant or level of Indian and another one might not feel so bad. These are not the beggars on the street, but people out in the country. If they had as much as someone else in that area, if they are not so poor compared to their neighbours, and if you look through history, humans have lived under different conditions, they had to live maybe very, very primitively a few thousand years ago, so much of this living of the modern humans is very, very recent. Man has existed for much longer than has this technology.";860;Future research
I think from what you’re saying it’s really comparative how much you need and there is a certain idea maybe in the so called Western World that we need more than we actually do need. It’s a certain greed which has kind of taken resources from so called Third World countries. Does it lead to wishes of further wealth which is maybe …?;"The more in the richer countries … if they wish to consume more, this is likely to provide some business for other parts of the world.  They will have maybe some imports. I mean if countries like the USA and Sweden are to import more, then that is business for other parts of the world, and maybe some choice products. But what makes it hard for the other parts of the world if the countries again like USA or Sweden can manufacture all that they need in manufactured goods, and furthermore produce all they need agriculturally so they don’t need to import anything and they have things to export.
That’s partly where we are today, isn’t it?
John Nash: There is a political issue about these subsidies for agriculture that European countries, which could import agriculture products with subsidised local agriculture and maybe produce the products there, like Germany may be growing a lot of wheat which they make into brot, and it might be we wouldn’t need to grow any wheat, they could import it from Russia or somewhere. And then that would provide business by trade.";860;Research
That’s right. It was partly concentrating on times which were very difficult in your life, or concentrating on that, and how do you feel about that version of your life that came across to the public and do you feel that there is a necessity for you to comment on that today? Or is it something that you left behind?;"John Nash: The movie?
The movie?
… what can be called schizophrenia has an unfavourable course in history …
John Nash: The movie is easier to comment on. The movie … Of course the family … We received some money for co-operating and authorising the movie. The movie is in part an interpretation of how a case of mental illness can go or could be the nature of a case and how it could evolve. Of course most typically what you call mental illness or what can be called schizophrenia has an unfavourable course in history, in the sense that the people never really recovered to be what you could call mentally well. They become like what are called consumers of mental health organisations. They are always taking some sort of a pill. They likely are not in hospital, they get out of hospitals but they live in a form of life that’s for people who are not really highly functionable, they’re not functioning, they’re not really in the economy as self supporting people. They’re not living a normal life from an economic point of view. So in my case there was certainly a recovery of sanity and more a possibility of doing normal activities, and so it was an interesting case. And I’m not a mental patient now, I don’t take any medicine, but I have a son who unfortunately uses medication and is in this process of taking drugs and seeing psychiatrists and this sort of thing. We don’t know what the course of that will be.
But I was disturbed in this way for a very long period of time, like 25 years, and sort of starting around 30 so it was quite a portion of a life’s history.
And the movie gives an insight into how this sort of thing can go. The movie actually, at the end of it, it suggests that the person in the movie is still taking some medicine, and taking a modern type of a drug after he had tried not to take any, he’d struggled with the issue of taking. So there is a difference there. The director in the movie didn’t want to suggest that people who are living in a state with controlled mental illness, that they should stop taking their medicine. It would be dangerous to suggest this.
So it doesn’t correspond to me accurately. There had been many years since I haven’t had medicine, since 1970, that’s 35 years, well more than 30 years.
Is it important for you …
John Nash: But even before that, most of the time I didn’t really take the medicine, so there are different types of … it’s not the same.";860;Creativity
But a film which was so widely seen and I was thinking that has it been important for you to be able to give your version of your life as well or is it something that you feel you can … because when somebody goes in and make a film about somebody’s life then you might need to say: That’s the film, but reality is a little bit different.;The film is artistic and it doesn’t describe accurately the nature of the delusional thinking that was my history, and it interprets … It has someone who sees imaginary persons, sees that different persons are actually present there /- – -/ and that is not, that’s not even typical in schizophrenia. But that interprets the idea of delusions. More typically a person may hear voices, they’re talking with spirits or something which are not there. This is the form of more typical delusions. But you can’t illustrate that in a movie very well. I mean if the movie shows someone who can be seen, then the person seeing the movie can better understand it. This can occur in mental illness but it’s the less typical form.;860;Career Development
It’s fascinating to talk to you and I’m really happy that you have spoken to us today. Is there any concerns … I was talking earlier about young students and somebody said to me that the teachers are those who open up doors, but that are the students who have to walk through them themselves. Did you have any teacher through your period at university which was particularly a role model to you? How has it been for you?;I certainly had some good teachers who were very helpful to me and influential. For example, in economics I only took one economics course and I was an undergraduate study in Pittsburgh at what is now called Carnegie Mellon, but by coincidence the person who taught the course, it was a course in international economics, and by coincidence this was someone who came from Austria. So there’s actually to consider Austrian economics is like a different school than typical American or British. So I was by coincidence influenced by an Austrian economist which may have been a very good influence.;860;Mentors (Role models)
Professor Selten, very welcome to this interview here in Lindau. My very first question would really be about the day ten years back when the telephone rang and you were told that you were to be given the Economy Prize in Memory of Alfred Nobel, and you were to share it with Nash and Harsanyi. How did you react, what did you feel?;"There was no telephone ringing. I was in the supermarket with my wife and we were shopping. So nobody was at home when the telephone was ringing. And usually you are called before it, but that since there was, since we were away so long, they then announced it, even if I was not yet knowing it.
So you didn’t know it?
Reinhard Selten:Didn’t know it, but it was already announced. So when I came home then, there are … a lot of people before my house and I thought: What happened? Maybe something bad happened here? Somebody broke in or something like that? Now people are collecting there for some reason, I didn’t know what. And I stopped the car and I went out of the car and somebody came to me and said I congratulate you. Gave hand. Congratulations, I said, for what? So will you explain to me?
What did you think then? Did you think it was hoax?
… I opened the door and then everybody is there, all journalists invading my house …
Reinhard Selten:No, I said to him Yes, I have to get out first my wife from the car and the wheelchair, to bring my things in, and I opened the door and then everybody is there, all journalists invading my house and so on. And it was so hectic that I didn’t have much time to think about it at all, not, I was just trying to cope with this situation.
Then the telephone was always ringing and all this and so … I didn’t really believe it, not at first. Not that it was a hoax, but I knew that it was true, but you don’t get emotionally adjusted to it immediately, no. You see that it is reported in television, but it has all an unreal flavour which for me something I couldn’t get really adjusted to. Took some time. And I only got adjusted to it when we went in Stockholm to the City Hall where there was this …
The big banquet?
Reinhard Selten:Yes, but actually the moment when we came near by car to the City Hall, then I began to feel that this is real … It’s the banquet and all of. But before, I mean, of course I knew that this had happened, I mean, it was intellectually clear, but it was not emotionally accepted still, no.";861;The impact of nobel on you
Has it affected your life in a way that you at times maybe would even regret taking a lot of time away from your research?;Yes, it is a little like this because my presence is respected at many locations and I have to travel more than I would like, because, well, sometimes you like to do it, but in many cases you do it in order not to disappoint some people whom you think you should not disappoint and so, not that it is not good, you know, but I have difficulty to do my work no? I really get under pressure also at home.;861;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What was it in the game theory that really fascinated you? I’m not sure, I just want to make a simple assumption here, that when you deal with game theory you’re really looking into predicting human actions?;"No, this was not … well, maybe predicting human actions is also a goal of game theory, but it is more the question what would rational players do in a game? Maybe players are not always rational. I mean, we know now that they are far from rational very often; I mean they are still boundedly rational, but not really rational. But nevertheless it is an important problem to think about what rational players would do in the game, how would they interact, yes? I mean, to have the game theory concerned with the definition of rationality. Regardless of whether people follow rationality or not you have to know what it is, yes?
And that was the real question of rational game theory. It had to be pursued even if I had … I mean I had done early experimental work and I knew that game theory would not … I mean, sometimes would be predictive certain, other cases it would not predict correctly human behaviour, you wouldn’t expect it. It always predicts human behaviour, but it was for a long time I was adhering to the idea of bounded rationality, I was convinced … ever since I have read the work of Herbert Simon in the late 50’s I was convinced about the idea of bounded rationality, but nevertheless I felt very much compelled to explore the definition of rationality in game situations. Was very important question because it’s not really clear what rationality should be in such interactive situations.";861;Creativity
It seems that it continued to fascinate you over a number of years because you have, which I found very interesting, worked with a lot of researchers, scientists from other academic disciplines. What made you want to do that?;I was always fascinated by the idea to do something about the real world, about science, about applications to the real world, but I wanted to rely on the expertise of people in the fields. So I worked together very successfully with the political scientist who was a real expert on the Middle East, Amos Perlmutter, and then I worked also very well with Avi Shmida, who is a biologist. Then also this fascinated us  by new ideas and concepts, I mean this biological game field fascinated me also and I came into contact with it and this was …;861;Motivation
How far can one take it? You had also looked into, for example, creating a game theory around, for example, real conflicts, international conflicts, which I found very, very interesting.;"I did several types of work about several investigations of application of game theory to international relations. And this one thing which is of special importance I think, is the scenario bundle method which I developed together with Amos Perlmutter and that was, I think, quite interesting for you.  I mean for a long time I didn’t do anything about it but just recently I did something together with the Security Office of the Austrian Defence Ministry, Mr Reiter, he had made a study of the Kosovo conflict and a book was published about this though this is still …
Would you please mention the title of the book, I think that could be very interesting if you remember?
Reinhard Selten: It was something like Zur Lösung des Kosovo-Konfliktes*, it’s a German book.";861;Creativity
Can one apply your theories on Germany today to look into the future or the different ways of, I mean, for example, a lot of Western countries today are dealing with problems of a slow economic growth, we have aging populations, we have less jobs available?;"We could look, I mean in all that we see lots of problems are and you have to go to economic data and this is not the problem of game theory, that is the problem of usual economic analysis which can do a lot about it. It has been done work on this. But what you could do, you could make a strategic analysis, even apply the scenario bundle method to the internal policy, to the parties, the political forces in Germany.
For example you ask the question what will happen in politics, not so much what will happen in 10, 20 years in political reforms, but whether the reforms will come about at all and you know what will be the consequences of the loss which are now made and so on. But it is difficult to make good predictions about this, because there is one weak point in all this. This was also in our earlier efforts and this is that political mass movements are difficult to predict. So our first implication of this was done to the Persian Gulf and this was in ’76, and then my experts at that time all said that a revolution in Iran is very implausible, very unlikely, will not happen and they had also good reasons for that. And it then happened.
Then Khomeini came to power very surprisingly and not only my experts but all secret services, everybody was really surprised. I mean, if some people said afterwards say they have known this before it’s just a hindsight by us. I mean you always find people who have known everything before allegedly but I don’t think so. I mean nobody expected such things and there are unexpected consequences, mass movements which you don’t predict.";861;Diversity in Science
Already at an early age the course of your childhood and the difficulties that your Jewish background created growing up in Germany you were deprived of opportunities and that it was hard at times but you have said in your biography that it made you act and think independently as well. Which way has that shaped you, do you think, if you would like to elaborate?;"I was always sceptical about authority, about things which were told by authorities, because I was living in a country and in a time where the authority was utterly wrong, in my view. And therefore I distrusted, I feared authority, I also fear it today. I am in a very, very fearful, I mean maybe more than other people, but I distrust authority. That makes me more independent and also some part of rebellious, I mean what … once said in … about me that I am a maverick, I’m a maverick.
Because also in science I took always some points of view which were somewhat oppositional. And I found the force to present oppositional views, to keep them. I was not feeling the pressure to conform to the general view about certain things. It was in science and it’s important to have an independent mind, to be able to follow your own ideas.";861;Life
Is it important to have a strong family, a wife who also stands behind you or with you during times of opposition or criticism? Has that been for you in that way?;Yes, my wife was important, also when we were young she was helping me, even in my scientific work she was helping me and so that was important. But she never pushed me to do this or that, you know what I mean? It’s not like that. I was pushed because I was always delivered from this …, science was for me like a drug. I am addicted to research, let’s say.;861;Family/Home Environment
I would like to just move on a little bit, as I know that I would very much like students who are listening to this interview to get advice from you, what field should they get into? If they really want to keep this in the future?;"I mean they should … I don’t want to give too specific advice, but it depends also on their character. I mean, if they want to have a sure and long career, then they should stay in the mainstream and try to be very quick and to do something and get their job. But if they’re more willing to take a little more risk they should enter a very young field and grow with it rather than to enter into an older field to learn a lot in this older field, to make a lot of investment and then go there with the mainstream.
What would such a young field be?
But that’s actually the challenge, that you don’t know how to attack the problems.
Reinhard Selten:For example bounded rationality is still very young, because there’s very much which we don’t know. I mean it’s very difficult. Usually these young things are very difficult and then people always say Oh, what can you do? I mean, we don’t know what we can do here. But that’s actually the challenge, that you don’t know how to attack the problems. And these are the worthwhile problems where there is still everything is confused and you don’t know how to attack it and how to yes?";861;Advice for young scientists
Has it in any way had any impact on your life, that they were immigrants?;"That’s a good question. It certainly made me very much aware of America as a home for immigrants and my father believed that America was the land of opportunity. I think that was a widespread feeling among the immigrants that families I knew in New York, they fled difficult circumstances and found opportunity in America, although it wasn’t always easy.
Was it so for your family? They left Russia.
… all the money that they took with them from Odessa was spent saving my father’s life …
Robert Fogel: They left Russia. My father got sick in Constantinople and all the money that they took with them from Odessa was spent saving my father’s life and they had to borrow money to pay for passage to the United States and they had to borrow money when they reached Ellis Island to send a telegram to an older cousin who was already in the United States and saying, please come and get us, so they literally started off penniless.
After about five years my father started his first business and so, he arrived in 1922, that was about 1927, I was born in 1926, and he had several businesses and he started a third one in 1933 during the Depression and that turned out to be very successful. He and his brother started the business and seven years later he had 100 employees. Many young people in high school were of a radical persuasion and I used to tell my father that capitalisation was a corrupting system and he would be astonished and he’d say America was the land of opportunity and he’d say look at me and I said, well he was the exception that proved the rule and then he’d go down the list of other people in the New York City meat business, who were also immigrants and who were much more successful than he had been, so he did live in a world in which a lot of people came in very poor and became well to do in 15 or 20 years.";862;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I would like to come back to that, looking at it from today’s point of view, but just staying a little bit with your background and your school years. Was it important for your parents and were they influencing you that you would achieve academically? I believe you started off with physics and chemistry and yet you ended up with eonomics and history.;"Right. That was not my parent’s influence, that was sort of the influence of the times because when I was in high school, I still thought of myself as becoming a physicist or a chemist and it was only when I went to college and there was so much discussion that we might have a new depression in the United States, there was a great deal of fear that the economy would not be able to employ, have full employment and so I became very curious about how the economy works and why it should be so problematic and I also discovered I loved history, it was a great story.
You said somewhere in your biography that it was a bit naive, you said you wanted to change the world.
Robert Fogel: Yes.
Do you still?
Robert Fogel: Well, like many young people I thought the reason we had so many problems was that there was an absence of goodwill and all you needed was for people to have goodwill and we were the generation that finally had goodwill. One of the most startling events in my life was when my older son was about 16 and he blamed me for all the troubles of the world. So I, I felt like telling him, oh no, I was just like you when I was your age, I wanted to change the world too. So if young people don’t have these dreams when they’re young, don’t ever have them, so I think it’s part of having you developing humanitarian perspective and learning that it isn’t quite so easy, that goodwill is not enough. You have to have good fortune and you have to have people on the other side who have goodwill.";862;Creativity
Yes. Staying there for a moment, you certainly went straight ahead into looking into history and economics and develop theories that eventually gave you the Prize. In which way have the work that you have done over the years and then the Prize, affected the way we can make people understand that we can foresee certain parts of development, for example?;Most of my work in recent years has been in the health area, the economics of health and the economics of aging and in that area we try to forecast the answer to questions like, what will happen to the health of people 20 or 30 years from now and what will happen to the cost of care, given that a much larger proportion of the population will be elderly? And if you’re going to forecast 20 or 30 or 40 years into the future, you have to have some idea about how things have been changing. So it’s impossible not to be historical, you have to go back and look at the record, at least 30 or 40 years, sometimes 100 years, in order to understand the process of change. So having a historical point of view I think has made me better able to identify the kinds of evidence that we need for forecasting.;862;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Will people who have the power to take decision, for example politicians, always acknowledge the need to do this kind of research, or would they rather ignore the historical facts because it might be easier to just leave it?;Well, if you take the people in Congress, the people who are the experts within Congress, on let’s say issues of aging and healthcare, they pay a lot of attention to the technicians, they don’t make policy independent of what the technical people are discovering or telling them, so I think they are very carefully listened to and they usually have on their staffs, people who are well trained in these fields and who have good ties to academic specialists. In the United States I think there is a pretty good interchange and my impression of most other countries is that it works, at least most other countries that I’ve visited and had a chance, it works similarly. Politicians realise they need to know what the facts are and that requires experts and they look to the experts to give them the information they need, so that they can make policy.;862;Role of Science
If one looks back to your work and some of the books that you have published, they have been met with criticism because they haven’t exactly fitted into the model of what was believed to be the truth, for example the history of slavery and its impact on the US economy. Why is that so difficult for people to accept, I mean the way you were met with this criticism, for example, what did it do to your research work and why was it so controversial?;First of all I did a lot of this work with Stanley Engerman, who was at the University of Rochester and when we first started looking at the evidence, we didn’t believe it. We thought that we must be doing something wrong and what was different in our work was, that we went back to records that couldn’t have been examined before because you needed high speed computers to digitise the information, so we were lucky to be around when high speed computers and their use was becoming cheap enough so that you could do very large projects. I once estimated what it would have cost to do that stuff if we had to do it in the old-fashioned way and it would have been about $100 million. So we were able to look at what had actually happened, looking at huge quantities of data and a much different picture than what all of us had believed up until then. So we were the first but that’s what generated the controversy. If someone else had been first, I would have been criticising them but we were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.;862;Creativity
I want to come to a question which has more to do with politics really. The way the United States today is acting in the Middle East. The way the US economy has been affected over the last couple of years, the huge budget deficit. Does it scare you, what’s going on at the moment in terms of the US involvement?;"Well, let me take the economy first. The President has very little effect on the economy. If you want to put blame or credit, the main person who influences the business cycle is the Head of the Federal Reserve Bank. The fiscal policy used to be thought to be an important instrument for managing the economy but that was several decades ago, it is no longer in the United States considered to be an important or even an effective instrument. In the case of the Bush tax cuts, normally when Congress passes tax cuts, in order to influence the business cycle, they spend so much time arguing about the legislation that by the time it’s passed, the recession is over and it just adds to the inflationary danger as you’re in a strong expansion. In this case the economy was somewhat more sluggish and so the tax cuts probably had a positive effect, but they’re not decisive in the way in which the economy is unfolding.
The main factor influencing the American economy is the rate of technological change and that’s the reason that because the output per worker has been very high and has been growing very rapidly and which means you can do more and more with less and less people at work, so that’s what’s made the growth in jobs in the United States sluggish. So it’s really factors outside of politics. I would say in general, the main role of the government is to create circumstances in which the rate of change in technology can proceed as smoothly as possible and there is also a role that the government has to play in equity, that not all people benefit from technological change, some lose their jobs while others are lucky to be in the right place at the right time and their incomes increase very rapidly, so there are equity issues in which the government has to play a role.";862;Menaing of Work
What you are describing at the moment, you know and there is a fear. I know that your topic here in Lindau will be talking about high performing Asian economies, you know the kind of competition we are already seeing obviously from that part of the world.;"Right and it is creating problems. It’s not so much an issue that’s been popularised by the election campaign, that we’re outsourcing a lot of jobs because, not only are we outsourcing jobs but Japan and Mexico and other countries are outsourcing jobs to the United States. It’s called international trade and international trade, like everything else, has winners and losers. The consumers benefit from trade but not all the producers do, some producers benefits, other find that they can’t compete and that creates problems of equity. So the government has to play a role in making it possible for people who are not in the favourite industries to be able to find better opportunities than they now have. It is an international question too, that is, the rich countries of the world have to make at least modest efforts. Modest efforts would be, let’s say, 1% of their gross national product, should be contributed to assisting poor countries. You can’t make a poor country rich with that kind of programme.
China is becoming prosperous at a rapid rate because of what China is doing, not because what countries and OECD are doing, but there are things like the HIV AIDS epidemic that we can sit by and say, isn’t it too bad? A small amount of resources can be very effective. So those critical things, we can do a lot to save lives. We can also make our technological knowledge available, both by being open to educating the children of Third World countries and also, as has been done, not entirely unselfishly, in starting joint enterprises in poor countries which is a way of transferring our technology, that is the technology of the richer countries of the world, to the poorer countries. So those are the way to do it, but there have to be people in those countries that seize the opportunity. If they’re involved in bitter tribal conflicts, nothing we do will permit them to get out of the difficulties that they have economically, health wise and in other respects.";862;Career Development
Very pleased to see you here. How did you react that morning, I think it would have been, when they called you and said that you had been awarded the Economic Prize in Memory of Alfred Nobel?;"Well, it was eventful. My wife and I were at a conference in Arizona and the phone rang about four o’clock in the morning, and by coincidence there had been some chap, in Belgium I believe, who was trying to get me to speak at a conference or something, and he’d been calling at very strange times, and so my first reaction when I first heard someone on the other end of the line was that it was this guy from Belgium. And then, you know, I was immediately reassured, and so I was pretty sure … and then, of course, your second thought is it’s a hoax, one of your friends or colleagues, and so I was 99% sure it was real.
After we’d finished the chat we turned on CNN and within about five minutes the first announcement came across, and it had many inaccuracies in terms of there were three of us, but nonetheless there was enough there that we were pretty sure that it was real. So needless to say we were both elated and we ordered room service and sat on the balcony looking at the sun coming up across the desert before everything broke loose and became crazy. But it was … and then I had not even been paying attention to the fact that this was the date for the announcement, so it was very much a surprise, a very welcome one.";868;Impact of Nobel on you
Any particular memory from the celebration in Stockholm that you would like to share with us?;Yes, we took an extended family, and my father was not well, but all of his doctors gathered together to find ways to get him there and in good health, and he absolutely revelled in it. He marvelled about everything, and as it turned out there were 11 in our party ultimately, and it turned out all of us got colds and were sick to varying degrees, except my father who went strong the entire time through and just had the time of his life, as did all of us, it was truly magical, there’s no other word for it.;868;The impact of nobel on you
In which way has it changed your life, if it has, professionally? Privately? After the award?;"I think there’s a period, and talking to others I think this happens a lot, in which you almost are unable to function because you feel that people expect so much, you know, out of the next paper. The standards are so much higher because of the prize that it’s almost impossible to write a paper and feel it’s good enough to submit for a publication, so there’s some of that. One gets over that. You certainly, especially in financial economics where there is a tie to the real world and to the world of commerce, you tend to get invited to, you know, ever so many lectures or talks or whatever you want to call them, and you have to have the good sense to limit that and to get back to work if you will. So it’s difficult, there’s no danger of being lionised by your colleagues, because your colleagues know exactly who you are, so that doesn’t change at all.
And so I think it’s basically trying to determine what balance you’re going to strike between, you know, among the things that you’ve always done. Some people feel that they have a /- – -/ and that they should use the position to go out and try to effect policy. Some, to some extent, commercialise it, you know, or take commercial advantage, let me say, of the position, but I think the majority of prize winners try to keep doing pretty much what they’ve been doing, with probably more focus on things that are for the public good perhaps, than they might have put otherwise.";868;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Have you felt that you had to kind of use this award in a way that would benefit more people?;"My research had been moving towards … My research has always had a substantial, pragmatic aspect towards helping people make sensible investment decisions, trying to understand the determination of asset prices and helping people then understand that and then make good decisions. Conditional on that, and I’d been focused heavily on institutional decision making by large pension funds for example, because that was the major vehicle, public and private pension funds. That was the major vehicle for saving and investment and sort of life time consumption planning, if you will. Up to the early 1990’s, but then as the shift accelerated towards putting more onus on the individual to make saving and investment decisions for retirement. I wanted to turn my research in that direction because there was going to be a huge need to help individuals do it right and sensibly. So that was the direction my research would have taken in any event. And it seemed to me then and it seems to me even more so now that that’s an area in which financial economics has to really help people.
In the Western World particularly? Or right across the board do you think?
William F. Sharpe. Well certainly in the Western developed world and many in the, you know, in the middle ground, I mean the Mexico’s and Chile’s of the world, in the countries that are really just beginning to develop, who are probably quite a way from that, but you’re certainly starting to see this as an issue in China for example. But then where you will in the process, so I think just increasingly that’s, rightly or wrongly, you know, the social programmes are covering a certain level, but even the social programmes, in Sweden for example, are now adding a substantial amount of decision making on the part of the individual.
Which has been very difficult for many individuals to accept, I think.
William F. Sharpe: I’m absolutely certain and there are some very serious issues as to how much latitude you want to give people, at least for a minimalist level of protection, there are some very, very important social issues, yes.";868;How to Spend the Nobel money
Do you think we are at some kind of turning point there? I mean with the Western World and governments in the Western World has to rethink?;"I think it needs to be thought through much more carefully. My belief is that the driving force is the demographic shift towards so many more older people per younger person, basically, in so many of our countries, and we need to figure out an appropriate way to share risk across those generations and of course within the generations as well, and I don’t think we’re anywhere near the point of having understood or thought through, especially at a political level, what the trade offs are. And so I think far more needs to be done to inform public policy, but there’s a lot of fundamental, financial, economics work to be done as well.
In the meantime they need to try to take what we think we understand about asset prices and bring it to bear on the decisions that individuals are making and are increasingly making and help them one way or the other to make those decisions intelligently.";868;Research
It’s a fascinating field and so much still to be done, I would like to come back to that a little bit further down in our interview, but as a child, were you thinking that you would go into this field? I know that you like sailing for example, I don’t know whether that was later in your life, but as a child were you interested in maths, for example?;"No, well I mean, you know, if you go straight through high school as I was, I enjoyed the technical courses, chemistry and physics and mathematics to an extent. My mother wanted me to be a doctor, so I started out in college in a pre-medical programme, didn’t like chemistry in college, for whatever reason, and shifted to a business major, knowing nothing about business majors or business for that matter. My parents had both been educators, and so the first course I took was the required beginning economics course and until my sophomore year I didn’t know anything about economics, economics was not in the high school curriculum in California in my day, and I loved this course, you know, I loved …
Why?
William F. Sharpe: I loved the beauty of it, I loved the logic of the theory, I loved the practical aspects of it and it just, I just really enjoyed it, and I thought, well, I don’t really know what economists do, I suppose I’ll work for a government or something, but I had to take more of this, so I switched to an economics major. And never looked back.";868;Family/Home Environment
I can understand that it must be fascinating. The other thing that you did was also to … you were early going into computers and learning about computer programming. Did you at that time foresee in which way we would be depending on computers, particularly in the financial field?;Absolutely not no. Again, I think, I went into computer programming partly out of necessity, but I was at a very exciting place in RAND corporation, where some of the most important early work on the computer programming and computer software, if you will, and algorithms was being done. And I’d learned programming both to help me in my own research so I could do my own research processing, but also it was, sort of, like the economics experience. I just loved the logic and the practicality of it and the fact that, you know, it’s very Pavlovian in that you do something here and then you get an immediate response to the stimulus, so you get rewarded very, very quickly if you do it right. So how much of it, my interest in programming, was pragmatic and how much was just, you know, liking the logic and the practicality of it, I can’t tell you, but I continue to programme to this day, many, many hours. Again, it’s very rewarding.;868;Motivation
And the financial market, I mean, we can sit anywhere in the world and do huge transactions or small transactions, does it scare you or is it a useful tool in today’s financial market?;I would say “yes” to both questions. It’s frightening, on the other hand it’s extremely useful, and there’s so much we can do to allocate risk officially across regions, across individuals, across institutions. But with that comes danger. You have to learn how to use the tools and you have to build the institutions that can at least minimise, never probably avoid, the risks associated with people making honest mistakes and people doing dishonest things, because both happen. And they’re very, very powerful incentives in the financial world to do things dishonestly, and so it’s very dangerous, but it’s such a force for good if used appropriately, that I think we’ve just got to find a way to minimise the bad things and be able to enjoy the good aspects.;868;Career Development
Every theory that you’re coming up with you should be your own devil’s advocate … Have you continued to have that, brought that with you in your daily life?;Yes indeed. Because of the jetlag I was awake for several hours last night and working on some theory that I’ve turned my attention to, and I was doing exactly that: Let’s see, I think I can make the following simplification and then say, you know, if I were the reviewer, if somebody had given that paper with that method and I were the reviewer, whose job was to find fault with it, what would I try to find that was wrong with the argument or wrong with the algorithm. I think that’s absolutely essential. Question not only everybody else’s work, but question your own work as you do it, let alone after it’s done.;868;Creativity
The model that you got the prize for, so to speak, the capital asset pricing model, has been part of many students’ text books over the year. Today, how valid is it? And obviously it’s used a lot, but do you see that it needs to be revised at times? How do you look at that theory that you then brought up, so to speak?;"That’s a question that it’s hard to answer in less than 200 pages, but let me take a crack at it. The original capital asset pricing model made a great many, very simplifying assumptions as theories do, but especially the first theory that tries to tackle a particular area and in some ways it was, again others were working within similar areas, I’m not saying that I was the only one, but it was really simple, it was simple, and then that’s a great strength, but it’s also a great weakness. In the period since the early 1960’s people have looked at a lot more elements of what happens in the real world when asset prices are determined. My most recent work has actually started from a different place, started from the Arrow–Debreu view of the world, which is different than the Markowitz view of the world, and tried to explore a lot of the aspects of quote reality. In that setting, that exploration, if you look at the simpler cases that motivated the CAPM, produces the CAPM, in the more complex cases it produces something that would be more nuance than have more complexity.
What continues to come through pretty strongly, sort of the fundamental, economic insight that the risk that is rewarded with higher expected return, it was generally risk associated with doing badly in bad times, that’s sort of the key insight, and that is preserved, not perfectly, but reasonably well in quite broad settings, where you take into account many other aspects: people have jobs, people have houses, people differ in their predictions of the future etc. And so I’ve been working in that area, I have a book in draft form exploring some of that, using simulation technology actually. Computer programming and stuff. So yes, is the CAPM too simple? Yes. Can we do better? Yes. Have we done better? Yes. That is not to say that it’s a simple matter to empirically differentiate among the possible candidates for a broader approach, but I don’t tend to think of the alternatives as replacements for the CAPM, but more realistic models building off the same basic idea of prices being determined by people coming into market and interacting with one another and doing trades and setting prices until equilibrium’s determined.";868;Research
… It’s more a complex economic situation in the world today since the first model was presented or the first draft or the model or the version.;That’s interesting, it raises an interesting point. There was a period in the late 1980’s in which I was working with some models which took into account the stylised fact that it was probably difficult or costly or possibly impossible for people to take so called short positions, to take negative positions in assets. And I’ve gotten some rather nice results, but I more or less, and I described some of that in my Nobel speech, but to some extent I’ve convinced myself that because of the modern developments in risk sharing, with derivatives and exotic financial instruments. Probably the world is closer to the simple CAPM in some ways than it was when I did the CAPM, because now it is possible to take different positions, vis à vis risk, using financial derivatives where before it was very difficult for people who wanted to do that in certain circumstances, to take short positions and engage and get their broker to load them stock etc. So to some extent, I think that the increase in financial technology, broadly construed, has actually brought us closer to some of the “perfect world” in some of the simpler economic models, be they Arrow-Debreu or CAPM type.;868;Research
You have yourself gone between the economic world and the so called real world, working as a consultant, starting up your own firm. How important has that been for you, to be able then to test and to verify and to learn as well, I presume, from the so called real world?;"In financial economics at least, I certainly won’t speak for other fields, but in financial economics I think that each side can inform and improve the other. I think that it’s really helpful when you’re doing academic research, to know something about the instruments that are available and some of the transactions costs if you will, and institutional impediments in the real world, and also some of the motivations, if you will, of the people who are players in the real world. I think academic research can be informed first of all as you can focus on unimportant problems, and then you have a better notion of what’s important, and you can build more realistic models of the people who are interacting, creating the worlds that you’re trying to understand.
I think the real world can considerably inform the academic research …
I think the real world can considerably inform the academic research, and of course I have to think that the academic research can be of huge value in the real world, I do think that, and that’s been my experience, and I think the experience of many. I think in fact it’s a bit of a conceit for a financial economist, but I think we think, many of us, that we have had more impact on actual practice than a number of fields both in economics and perhaps in other disciplines. I don’t know about other disciplines, and certainly I think that in many of fields of what’s called business, administration of business education, I think the impact of economists on the financial practice in the world has been really quite profound.
I think, whether you want to do academic work only, or you want to do practical application only, spending time on both sides of the street is helpful. My personal circumstances that I, what I really want to do is understand the world and help people, you know, make better decisions in the world, so given that particular utility function, it was imperative that I spent time on both sides, and what I’ve been trying to do over the course of my career is get the balance right. Sometimes it’s too much on one side, sometimes it’s too much on the other side and so it’s a delicate balancing act.";868;Motivation
"What advice do you give to young students who are looking into the field of research? People that you have met and that you are meeting, maybe right now? Are there any particular fields that one should look into? Given what you said earlier about the way that the individual today, particularly in the Wstern World, has to really think about ones finances and particularly in the
pension schemes, for example.";"I think there are two issues. If you’re advising a PhD student as what to do and the student wants to have an academic career, there are certain things which will give you a better chance of going to a top university or research institution, and they tend to be more abstract, they tend to be more technical, they tend to be in areas that are particularly demanding, technically demanding, at least that’s my experience. On the other hand, if you want to do something that’s going to change the world in important ways, then you do want to look at the big problems, that are both big and hard, and potentially problems that you can contribute to solving …
For example?
William F. Sharpe: Well, again my personal preference at the moment is helping individuals or helping societies decide how to balance the demands of those who want to consume, be they old, retired people or young working people, and those who have to produce. So how are we going to take the amount of production that we can get out of the society and distribute it among the people in the society? And that has of course a temporal aspect as the traditional way is that you work when you’re young and then you consume less than you produce, and then when you’re old you consume more than you produce, and how we’re going to work all that out given huge uncertainties and particular uncertainties on the mortality, healthcare side which are, I mean grave uncertainties for the individual but even societal.
And that of course has huge implications for distribution of production and consumption across the globe between the less developed world, where we’re still getting population increases, and the developed world where the population at least, add some immigration, is either stagnant or actually going to be decreasing apparently. So there are huge issues to be dealt with there, it cuts across many, many fields of economics and many fields that aren’t economics, and so that’s an area that I find fascinating and is clearly important and the area that I spend most of my time thinking about. But that doesn’t mean everybody should.";868;Advice for young scientists
That does lead me to the last question really, and it’s been fascinating to listen to you, and that is if we just look at US economy today, for example, the huge budget deficit and obviously taking on in a politically huge commitment outside America, I’m thinking about Iraq, for example. How volatile is the world economy when we have all these uncertain factors, and when you can see one of the largest economies in the world having such huge economical problems as we are now seeing in America?;"First let me give you a caveat, macroeconomics and monetary economics, for that matter international economics are not my fields, so my opinion is not a very informed opinion, I’ll give it to you anyway. I’m very disturbed obviously, as is everyone, with what’s going on, things that you mentioned. I’m not at all convinced that our responses politically or economically have been the best responses to the situations that we’ve been in the last few years, and I’m speaking of the United States. In fact, I have fairly strong opinions to the contrary, but again, I don’t want to say that those are deeply informed opinions from a professional standpoint, but I think the general issue of the increased uncertainty, one of the fascinating issues, and it’s a sort of a knee jerk reaction when you’re asked the question, is to think about allocating that risk across the global world.
Take a trivial example. Let’s say we know that there will be a level x of terrorist incidents across the globe, but we don’t know where they’ll be or perhaps what form they’ll take, but the law of large numbers is such that we can predict, with quite some accuracy in some abstract way, the level. Then presumably we could set up various kinds of insurance or financial contracts across the globe to pool that risk so that obviously the people who are directly and personally affected get the pool of risk, of being injured or killed. But nonetheless you can ensure some of the economic effects, so it’s possible that with good risk pooling procedures, and we’re better at that now than we used to be for all the reasons we’ve spoken about, that we can ameliorate the impact of that on any given person rather than having a situation where you’re attacked and suffer badly and I’m not attacked and I’m fine.
… the idea of global terror insurance is something that comes naturally to mind  …
We can pool the risk so we’ll both suffer to some extent but not differentially other than the direct personal costs of attacks, so the idea of global terror insurance is something that comes naturally to mind for somebody thinking about risk sharing and risk pooling. That can help ameliorate the uncertainty and perhaps dampen the impact in terms of a global meltdown. But nonetheless it’s terribly concerning even with the best risk sharing in the world, and of course from a human standpoint everything that’s going on. And I’m worried, obviously you alluded to the issue of deficit financing, I’m worried the inner generational issues, which I think are not trivial at all, and have not been thought through that well by politicians, and certainly have not been brought to the level in political discourse, at least not in the United States, to allow anything like an informed decision. I despair of politically informed decisions given the nature of our politics at least, on much of anything, so I think there’s much more that needs to be done, and it’s a very frightening time. Very frightening. And I think economics can help! Can’t solve all the problems by any means but I think it can help. Good economics.";868;Menaing of Work
Because when you see the huge disparity in the world, I mean, between the developed and the developing world, there’s another huge concern, of course, which we could … I mean, what is feeding, what is feeding the terrorist attacks that we are seeing as well, and that’s a huge political question obviously but I think as well not economical question.;I mean even if you take, you know, the classic economic person argument where everyone cares only about his or her welfare, you know, narrowly construed, which is a terrible view to have to take, but even if you take that view, I think, you know, what you’re suggesting I believe makes great sense. It undoubtedly is worthwhile for people in the highly developed countries to do more than they’re doing now, to redress some of the disparity between highly developed and highly undeveloped or far less developed countries, just as a matter of pure self interest. Now, of course, if you add to that some concern for other people, then you’d get an even stronger case, so I do not think, and I will say mea culpa especially in the case of the United States. I don’t’ think we’re doing anywhere near enough from a humanitarian developmental aspect, strictly from a self interest standpoint, and of course I would think we should do more than that, but that’s my personal preferences.

Your lecture here in Lindau has been about low wage workers in high income countries. That is a typical Western World scenario. In Germany, for example, the government is suggesting that jobless people should stay on the social benefits, but above that get a job and only get paid one euro an hour. Is that a way to move ahead, to try to solve this enormous problem of the joblessness and the less work that is available to people in this part of the world?;"Something of that sort, I think, has to be done. The background for this is very important. We are all, both in Europe and in North America, looking forward to a time when our populations will have aged, when there will be fewer people of working age, compared with the size of the population to be supported. So labour will be scarce and it is important to have people who can work, working. In Europe this is compounded by the fact that even now there is quite a lot of unemployment, much more unemployment than in the United States for instance and more than Europe has had in the past.
So, how to get people who are now unemployed back into the labour force and back into jobs? If a civilised country like German, like Sweden, like any, would like to limit extreme poverty, then people who are unemployed and have no income have to be provided for, some way. And if they are provided for relatively generously, they may have no motive to work, even if jobs were available, because their benefits may amount to as much as they could earn in a labour market and they come without the effort of getting up early in the morning and going to work and doing perhaps some unpleasant work and coming home tired in the evening. So, this creates a problem.
One way to deal with that problem is to somehow, even for people whose earning power is very low, to make their work pay them enough so that it is preferable to work than to sit with benefits. In Germany, the proposal is that people who have been unemployed, perhaps for a long time, and have been receiving social benefits, if they go to work, they find a job and go to work, then they continue to receive their benefits, but they receive an additional one euro and hour or two euros an hour on top of that. That does make work more profitable, make work yield more to a person than simple benefits, but it’s a small amount and there is something a little insulting about the one euro an hour that you get for your work.
In the United States we have tried to attack the same problem, even though we have less unemployment than Europe, by what is called the Earned Income Tax Credit and it works this way: If you work a certain number of hours a week, a minimum of a certain number of hours a week, whether it is 20 or 30, I don’t remember, it doesn’t matter, and if you earn less than a certain amount, you fill out a tax return. But instead of paying a tax, you get a payment back from the tax authorities, enough to raise your income, often by a substantial fraction, by as much as 1/4 or 1/3, which is a little better than a euro an hour or two euros an hour. And this is a way of letting the labour market work and asking employers to pay only what the job normally brings in the market, but then putting on top of that, a negative tax, a rebate, a credit from the Federal Treasury which can bring the income for such a person to perhaps a decent level and this has been a solution to the problem in the US and something like it. I’m not sure that the German device is the best, but something like it could be used elsewhere.";871;Creativity
Could there be another solution to the so called Western problem of ageing population, less people working. There are millions of people in the so called Third World who really would like to come and earn a living in this part of the world, but they are not really welcome.;That would be a solution, but a solution that brings obviously its own problems. The arrival of immigrants from poor countries, Third World countries, into Europe or into the United States, does two things for the ageing population. First of all it brings a number of young people of working age and secondly, those people normally have more children than Swedes or Germans or Americans are now having, so they will help in the future with the population. From that point of view, immigration is a solution to the problem. The difficulty is that many Americans, Europeans, resist immigrants. They see their culture changing, they see the streets look different than the way the streets used to look, you know, from some points of view that is an additional benefit, a little variety is a good thing. A street full of everyday Americans is not so interesting as a more colourful street, but it does create political resistance and it’s impossible to know how that will come out. I presume what will happen is that there will continue to be immigration but rather less than there might be or there might be use for in terms of working population.;871;Research
Is it so that we in the Western World have created a situation where our material standard is so high, our demands are so high that we really are not able to forsake anything, any longer. I mean, what is the solution? Must we forsake anything to make this world become a bit more, less divided between the rich and the poor?;That would be a very nice outcome, but I do not think it’s likely to happen. You know, there has hardly been a time in the past 200 years when you could not have said something similar, even when standards of living in the West were much lower than they are now. They were better than they had been and they were better than in poorer countries and the possibility was always there that the rich people of the Western countries would tax themselves, so to speak, to benefit the poor elsewhere. I do not think mankind has a very great record at caring seriously about people far away, whom they do not know, who speak a different language, who live a quite different life, so I suspect that if a solution to that enormous world inequality was a dreadful thing, I think the solution is more likely to come from raising incomes abroad in Africa, Latin America, Asia and elsewhere, than from generating sacrifices from Europeans and Americans, who like their comforts and I do not think one can blame them for liking their comforts. So I think our efforts look to be focussed on trying to raise standards of living elsewhere through primarily the work and investment of the people there.;871;Research
Can we expect this idea of continued economic growth when we know that there is a limitation to the world’s natural resources though?;"I am a little more optimistic than most people about that, for these reasons. We know that as incomes rise, at least this has been true in all of the Western World, what people want to spend their incomes on is services, rather than material goods. This is often put amusingly by describing ourselves as moving toward a weightless economy, an economy in which the gross domestic product will not weigh as much as it does now and that is clearly happening. Now education is much less resource using than driving an automobile and banking, financial services, is much less resource using than food production. But in fact, as we get better off, we spend a much smaller fraction of our income on food and a much larger fraction on education, on financial services and on services generally, so there is some tendency, an almost automatic tendency for countries as they get more wealthy to behave in a somewhat more sustainable way.
The second thing is, we have not yet made a real effort in the technologically advanced Western World to encourage renewable sources of energy. We are still an oil and natural gas based civilisation.  Now we could, I don’t know exactly when, because a lot of technological progress is needed and that is always uncertain, but sooner or later we will be shifting noticeably toward energy derived, well all of it comes from the sun one way or another, but from wind or from direct sunlight and so we will be able to conserve energy resources much more than we do now. Even automobiles, you know, can be run without the use of petroleum based fuels, so with a little more emphasis on renewable resources, we still of course, by the way, in Germany, in Sweden, in the US, we produce an incredible amount of waste.
My pet complaint is packaging. Everything one buys comes in packages …
My pet complaint is packaging. Everything one buys comes in packages which first of all, it takes an engineer to get them open and I have spent a whole aeroplane trip trying to open the little envelope with peanuts and don’t succeed and then we simply throw away the wrappings. If we never wrap them so much in the first place, we could also … So between conservation and the consumption of services, I think the situation is serious but not desperate and our governments could probably encourage the conservation of materials much more than they do, either through regulation or through taxation or things like that. So, we will have to work our way in that direction but I don’t think it’s hopeless, I don’t think the situation is hopeless.";871;Research
That’s right, yes. I was wondering your opinion. Is there a time to look into alternative ideas around economic thinking, you know, environmental economists, developmental issues? Do you think we’re going to see a different kind of prize takers in the future?;"I think that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has already begun that process. Of course one of the earlier Nobel Prizes in Economics went to development economists, Arthur Lewis and Theodore Schultz, but Amartya Sen was a very recent prize winner and he is clearly unorthodox in the sense that he is concerned with problems that most economists don’t think about. He’s a person who seems to be as much read by philosophers as he is by economists. I think that there may very well be soon a prize given to environmental economists, I think there’s every reason to believe that the tendency is in that direction and I think that’s on the whole a good thing and I would like to see it continue.
It may also be that economics, science of economics itself, will turn more in the direction of economic development and environmental preservation and things of that sort. There’s a very interesting history. In the 1950s or 1960s, development economics, the study of development, the evolution of poor countries was very popular amongst graduate students. Then it kind of lost popularity, I think because there was not much success in generating new ideas and if the new ideas aren’t there, then young students are not likely to be attracted to it. There has been a revival of development economics, at least there has been in my own university, at MIT, and I think, although I’m not sure about other places and I think it’s because there is some intellectual ferment, there are new ideas. There are new kinds of data available so one can ask questions that previously could not possibly be answered because the basic information was lacking and that seems to be changing and I think that’s a good change.";871;Research
Is there a realisation as well, some kind of ethical even or moral realisation that maybe the financial economy or the financial market is not the full solution to the  problem that the world is facing?;"Yes, but I think that the ethical imperative has always been there. I think that economists, academics and their students have always felt that there was some obligation first of all to advocate policies that will help poor countries lift themselves out of poverty and some obligation to think about those questions and try to learn more about what it takes to improve situations and you know, there have been some notable successes and the biggest poor country of all, China, now appears to be advancing at a fairly rapid rate, so I really think the problem has been, at least in academic circles, discouragement. No-one wants to spend their life working on a problem that is too hard to solve. For one thing, it is not easy to get promoted when you’re doing that, but for another, you get your pleasures from academic work in economics by working on problems that you can just barely solve, that are hard, so you feel good if you have succeeded, but that are not so hard that you can’t get anywhere.
What I’m hoping is that there will be this kind of intellectual advance and one other source of discouragement about this in the past has been the feeling, and I think this is what was in your mind, that merely trying to provide funds for poor countries, the sort of thing that the World Bank has been doing for 50 years now, is now adequate. It no doubt helps, or perhaps there is doubt that it always helps, but the main thing is that the feeling has grown that it will take something more than simply providing funds to allow or to find a route, a way in which poor countries can raise their standards of living, so there is some of that as well.
Now, the question that I think is still a little dodgy is, to what extent deep down most Europeans and Americans think that success in a poor country means becoming more like us or whether there is some other route to development which does not involve our sort of consumer oriented production, oriented economy. I don’t think that there is any general answer to that question, I think you find out by trying and seeing what happens and seeing whether other countries, currently poor countries, like India, like China, like Indonesia, can find what will be development from their point of view in the sense that those people will feel better off, but that will not simply amount to being like Americans or Germans or Swedes. One can think about it. If I wanted to write about that I might be just inclined to write a novel, except that I know I’m incapable of writing a novel, but that’s the sort of thing that you find out experimentally, I guess.
It’s very interesting. I just want to briefly touch on this: South Africa, who has an enormous challenge ahead of spreading its wealth and really making people, who are discluded of any kind of decision taking for economic wealth to kind of, spread their risk. They’re dealing a lot with Asia, for example, in their trade and it has certainly been of some great benefit for the macro economic situation in the country, so they are also looking into different ways, not just the traditional.
Professor Robert Solow: Yes, I didn’t know that about South Africa, of course I know what the problems in South Africa have been, but I think that the idea of diversifying both their economy and their trading partners, that sounds very interesting and I think it’s likely to succeed.
Mmm … and I think that scares certain more established economies like the United States and Europe as they see how South Africa are diversing.
Professor Robert Solow: Oh, I hope it doesn’t, because the possible benefits are very great and any possible costs to the rich countries are bound to be small compared with the amount of wealth that we now have.";871;Research
We just want to go back a little bit to that day in 1987 … I don’t know if you got a phone call or how you got to know that you were to receive the prize, but I very much liked your speech at the banquet, when you said “In the last seven weeks I’ve been asked to solve X amount of countries economical problems” and you said “Of course I know how to answer that, but I’m not going to tell you now”. How did you feel and what has it come with to get this honour or this prize?;"Well, of course, you know, it’s a very great satisfaction, and the satisfaction is that it suggests that you’re admired by the very people whose admiration you care most about, namely other people in your profession. So, I mean, there’s no doubt that it’s a great boost for the ego, there’s no way out of that. There is however that the remark I made on that staircase in Stockholm had the ring of truth to it. There is a feeling that if you have won the Nobel Prize in Economics, you must know the answer to every question and that persists. It’s now 1987, 2004, that’s 17 years ago, but when I was meeting, here in Lindau, with a roomful of graduate students, they started off by asking questions that I thought I might have some chance of answering, but every so often, someone asked me a question of such cosmic significance that I wouldn’t know where to start answering it. And I suppose they still had the feeling, you know, here is someone who has a Nobel Prize in Economics, good Lord, he must be able to answer any question we ask.
That can be a little embarrassing at times, but it’s probably good for one’s psychological health every so often to have to say “I don’t know” or “I haven’t the slightest idea” or “I wouldn’t even know how to begin thinking about that question”. There is, you know, just an enormous respect for the Nobel Prize which means it must have been conducted in a very intelligent way so that one still has the feeling that  … I have to be very careful about what I say because anyone who hears what I say may be inclined to believe that it’s true and one doesn’t want to mislead anyone, so there is that, there’s no question about it, yes.";871;The impact of nobel on you
If you had to describe it in your own words – there are several things that you’ve been awarded for – if you were to describe it in your own words, what do you think is the most meaningful thing that you’ve brought to the study of macroeconomics and to policy making?;I’ve worked in two or three different areas, but in the area of employment and unemployment and fluctuations, that kind of thing, what I think I did was I brought expectations into the analysis of price setting and wage setting which led to new light on cost inflation, the difficulties of disinflation. I also introduced into wage setting something called “incentive wages” – that’s what I called it – incentive wages. That proved to be quite important because the idea was that each firm is trying to pay a better wage than the other firms in order to reduce the quit rate among its employees, but as they all try to get an advantage over one another they just end up the industry standard pay scales so that labour becomes more expensive for all of them and as a result employment falls and unemployment is created.;838;Meaning(Values) of Work
Where typically do you see these phenomena? Is it just industrialised countries or would you say that there is relevance for it all over the world?;"It’s pretty relevant all over the world. Even in less developed countries you see zillions of people queued up at the post office for some jobs there or you see people waiting at the factory gates. They can’t knock on the door and bid down wage rates in order to get themselves one of the jobs. The firm is not interested in paying less wages; it likes wages high.";838;Meaning(Values) of Work
In terms of arriving at your theories and doing your research, how much of impact have other Nobel Prize winners – specifically within your department at Columbia University – how much of how you think has been formed by what they think? How much of discussion is there?;"Edmund Phelps: Actually we don’t see each other very much.
You don’t?
Edmund Phelps: No, we’re all at airports and in airplanes and teaching classes and running around, so there isn’t very much opportunity for interchange. Also in this age of the internet you’re emailing everybody all the time, including people down the hallway.
And here I was thinking that you were having coffee in the coffee room with Joseph Stiglitz …
Edmund Phelps: No, those days are gone.
But they used to be?
Edmund Phelps: Yes, it used to be the case.";838;Impact of the Nobel on you
Perhaps we can touch on that, then, maybe that’s where we can lead into this thing that I’ve been wondering about as how educational institutions and how students as well have changed over the years since you were a young student.;"When I was a student we entered graduate school knowing not only very little economics but we also had a dreadfully poor background in mathematics. Most of us had never studied history either – knew nothing of psychology. We were just practically clean slates as we entered. But I guess what we had going for us is some pretty deep curiosity about the subject and maybe there was some part of it that we wanted to pursue in depth. Maybe we were more seekers and discoverers than today’s graduate students are.
Because they’re so prepared?
Edmund Phelps: Yes, but they do arrive with a dozen math courses under their belt. They come extremely well equipped. I’m just not sure that they come with the same inspiration or the same drive that we had then.";838;Life
I’m sure your students would actually disagree… which brings me on to another subject that’s actually quite interesting to me and I think probably relevant to lots of students and even people in business, up and coming through business – is the role of mentorship. Who have been your mentors and what have they meant to you?;"I think my earliest mentor was in high school. I used to play the trumpet and I was interested in music and the head of the music department at school took an interest in me and kind of motivated me to study music in various ways. He even created a course in musicology one semester for a group of us. He was quite an important mentor. Then in college I happened to have two brilliant teachers of economics. I was extremely fortunate to have them and they guided me I think to the right graduate school for me. Then there’s graduate school. I went to Yale and there was a wealth of very important, very interesting economists including William Fellner and Tjalling Koopmans and Henry Wallich and Robert Triffen and Jacob Marshak. All of them were Europeans. And then there were also James Tobin and Tom Schelling, and no doubt others that I may be forgetting. Both Tom Schelling and James Tobin got Nobel Prizes. Which ones were mentors? Well, James Tobin was a mentor, so was Tom Schelling, but also I think Willy Fellner, a Hungarian economist was probably the deepest influence on me in graduate school.
Can you tell me a little bit more about that influence, when you say it was the deepest influence?
Edmund Phelps: He was always quite interested in the murkier side of economics, of expectations, uncertainty. He had some instinctive perception that there are entrepreneurs out there in the market economy with any kind of luck and I think he conveyed a broader and deeper kind of economics than I was getting from most of my other teachers.
These are still the things that you talk about today of course.
Edmund Phelps: Yes.
I’m just thinking it was a very interesting fact, this interest in music that you had at high school. Why the jump from music into economics?
Edmund Phelps: It’s a staggeringly difficult question.
We have lots of time.
Edmund Phelps: I guess it’s true, it seems to me to be true, that if you’re a musician, a performing musician, you try to somehow recreate that music in an interesting way. You didn’t compose it, but you are bringing your own creativity to it. With regard to economics I think economics is a very mysterious, extremely challenging subject and I think it helps a great deal to be a creative person when you tackle economic problems, economic issues, because there’s no end of things that ought to be considered and thought about. The problem is just to think of them and organise them.
This is what you talk about as well, about bringing expectations into economics and it’s finding all the variables.
Edmund Phelps: That’s right, it’s throwing in things that are of central importance that somehow got neglected, overlooked.";838;Mentors (Role models)
What are the things that you think today are being overlooked in terms of variables that are being looked at for economic policy?;"I’d have to say creativity in business; the creativity of the entrepreneur. It just doesn’t exist in any formal economics course. It may be that in some business schools there are courses in entrepreneurship but what I mean is that in the way we teach let’s say macroeconomics – the economics of employment and inflation and growth and all that – as it’s taught in standard economics courses the word entrepreneur is never mentioned. The notion that there are entrepreneurs out there who have new ideas and who upset the applecart and who think outside the box and who actually change the economic model so to speak by dint of their innovations, all that is just alien to standard economics. So there’s a lot to think about and to bring in to the subject.";838;Future research
This is something that we hear about continuously across Europe, and I know specifically in Sweden we’ve just recently had a change of government which wants to be more entrepreneur friendly because we are losing manufacturing jobs, like most other countries. But how do you really breed entrepreneurs and how do you really support them? In what way would you suggest that politicians actually do it?;"That’s the 64 dollar question as we used to say, when I was a teenager. I imagine that the best strategy is to do 100 things and hope that some of them work – and if they don’t, do another 100 things. I don’t know how you breed entrepreneurs. If I wanted to be fanciful I would think about maybe changing high school programmes so that students are made to understand that you could be creative in business too. You don’t have to just go into dancing or something like that. There are all sorts of avenues for creativity. I do think – I’ve been writing about this a little bit and if time doesn’t run out maybe I’ll have a chance to say something about it at the end of my lecture on Friday – but I do think that here in the west (and this includes even the United States which is of course very west) the whole classical idea of the good life, a life of adventure, expanding your horizons, discovering your talent, that notion that’s in Aristotle and Cervantes and in Shakespeare and a whole bunch of other writers and thinkers, is just about lost. People today seem to be obsessed with job security and they seem to be asking the politicians to do everything possible to reduce uncertainty. But we can’t have an exciting life if we don’t accept uncertainty.
A certain amount of risk taking.
Edmund Phelps: Lots of it, yes.
A little bit of gambling.
Edmund Phelps: Yes. A shot in the dark.
Now and again.
Edmund Phelps: Right.";838;Diversity in sicence
Good one. I wanted to ask you a little bit – and we touched on this slightly before – but we talked a lot about successes and if I asked you which was the proudest moment of your career I’m pretty sure I know what the answer will be, but I’d like to also talk about failure because I think that shapes your route to success as well for people who hang in there and make it past a failure. Have you had any failures or anything that you would regard as a failure?;"I’ve had all kinds of failures. I never got an offer from Harvard. I never got into the American Philosophical Society, which irritates me no end. I’m an American. I’m a sort of a philosopher, too.
But why were you not allowed?
Edmund Phelps: It’s not a matter of not being allowed, it’s just they haven’t voted for me yet.
Ah, OK, is that how it goes? OK.
Edmund Phelps: I remember once – it was December 1992 and I got three pieces of dreadful news in a row – and I was talking with my wife from London when she was in New York and we were both discussing this string of misfortunes. But she said “Gee, you’re so resilient. You sound pretty upbeat considering these disasters”. I guess it’s true. I’ve always had my work to fall back on, I’m fascinated by my work and so in the end it doesn’t matter. I didn’t go into my career just to collect prizes or accolades or even money. I don’t have much money. I went into it for the adventure of it, the mystery of it.
So as long as you are able to keep your focus on your adventure and pursuing it you should be able to surmount …
Edmund Phelps: Yes, weather the storms.
… even one or two failures along the way.
Edmund Phelps: Yes. I’ve had more than one or two.
If you reflect upon them, have the failures been as important as the successes – in breeding resilience I mean; in moving ahead?
Edmund Phelps: That’s a hard question. I don’t know what to say. I’m still capable of writing books that fail. I don’t seem to have learned how to avoid that. I’m also capable of writing books that succeed. I think the thing is about learning from your mistakes, of course that must be important, but at the same time I’m always changing and the environment’s always changing. I’m not going to make the same mistake twice but …
There will be new variables?
Edmund Phelps: … it’s hard to draw lessons from the past about what to avoid in the present.";838;Creativity
I guess I’m thinking about it in terms of students today – those people who will probably want to watch you and listen to you and ask you how did you make it – you must have had really, really bad days – how did you make it past your bad days? How do you keep focus? How do you move on? Is there any advice that you can give to people who want to hear that?;"Edmund Phelps: No, just carry on.
Keep having fun.
Edmund Phelps: Yes. Keep doing what you like.
Keep doing what you like.
Edmund Phelps: Yes, I think that’s a good one.
That makes a great deal of sense actually.
Edmund Phelps: Right.
Since the announcement was made – you’re in Stockholm now, but there was some time in which you were still in the US as well – how did winning this prize actually change things for you at work, among your colleagues? What did your students say? What were the responses from people?
Edmund Phelps: I think my students were kind of thrilled by it really and very nice. My colleagues were also happy for me. It wasn’t the first Nobel Prize in economics around Columbia; it was the fourth one I think, and these came in the past 10 or 12 years. Of course it’s nice to get increased recognition in the university community and I have a little more clout now than I did before – maybe a lot more clout. So, from that point of view, that’s another dimension in which it’s very nice to have a Nobel Prize.
Are there greater expectations from you as well now?
Edmund Phelps: Yes. Now people sometimes interview me for television shows and ask impossibly difficult questions, so that’s a challenge that I could always avoid before but now …
But now you look forward to it?
Edmund Phelps: With mixed feelings.";838;Advice  for young scientists
There have to be a few reservations. I was talking about your students. We talked a little bit about how students have changed over the years. What about educational institutions themselves? How have they changed, in your opinion, over the years? I know you can’t actually generalise across the US and Europe and the rest of the world. But in general what is your feeling about the way that education is going in the institutions? What are they focusing on?;"I’m not sure that my experience is broad enough to qualify me to speak on that. As I said before, I was very lucky in graduate school at Yale to be in the middle of this hothouse of intellectuals, about half of them European. It was almost a unique time. When I was an undergraduate in college, at Amherst College, it was again a very special experience. We had wonderful courses in the humanities and in philosophy and I took several of those, also they had a wonderful economics department, really kind of inspiring. Now is that kind of thing around today? Maybe it is. It was rare then. If it is, it’s pretty rare now. Maybe I detect that there was a little more informality and a little more creativity in teaching and in shaping courses 50 years ago, 55 years ago, more creativity, more flexibility than there is now. Maybe that has to do with the fact that all the professors are so bent on their research that they don’t throw as much of their creativity and energy into teaching, and they put more of it into research than was the case 50 years ago. But then that’s nice for the students too, because then they see that their teachers are doing real stuff; they’re not just talking about the research of others.";838;Environment
I increasingly get the sensation that when we talk about students, what people study at universities, Sweden is one of those countries, thanks to its social welfare system, where basically anyone who wants a higher education can have one free of charge with the result that a lot of people do study and do have a higher education. At the same time there seems to be a mismatch with this creative situation, where you have lots of highly qualified people but you don’t have the jobs in industry to accommodate them. We talk about growing a services sector here to replace manufacturing jobs and there are too many highly skilled people. Would you agree that this is something that’s happening, not just here but elsewhere as well – perhaps in other Scandinavian countries?;"I wouldn’t be surprised. There’s a little debate going on in economics about how do you pep up the economies of Western Europe. Now I haven’t been thinking very much about the Scandinavian economies lately – in recent years I mean – but I know that on the continent it’s often proposed that what we need to do is step up the breadth and the quality of education. But if you don’t do something about the economy so that the economy creates jobs for more of these people who are highly educated then there’s going to be frustration and many of the newly created highly educated people will go off to Silicon Valley or something like that; they won’t stay at home. I’m sceptical about thinking that the solution for Europe’s economic problems is more education. I think it’s a better economy, and a better economy would be able to utilise more educated people.";838;Environment
I’m going to go onto something else now and just ask you, just for the heck of it as Americans would say, if time and money were no obstacle what causes would you dedicate your time to? What are the things that you think are important to you that you would like to spend time on but perhaps don’t have the time today?;"I would like to see the creation of better economies – let me say in the west because I’m not an expert about the economics of the Third World and the less developed countries. But I have the sense that there should be a lot of rethinking about business life, I think that there should be more recognition of the importance of intellectual stimulation in the workplace and problem-solving and discovery of talents. That’s one dimension in which I think that a great many present-day economies are woefully deficient in. The other dimension is the disadvantaged. Both in Europe and in the United States you have very high unemployment rates among the least advantaged people in the labour force and in the United States you have crushingly low rates of pay also for those people. That’s another dimension in which I’d like to see a major improvement in the performance of the economies of the west. I think this is possible. I think where you don’t have an exciting workplace – which is most of the economies of continental Western Europe – there’s a solution to that and the solution is more entrepreneurship; a lot more entrepreneurship and a quantum improvement in attitudes towards business and willingness to bear uncertainty and so forth.
So this is as much to do with business leaders leading companies as it is to do with politicians actually supporting a system that would allow them …
Edmund Phelps: I think on the regulatory front there are all sorts of things the governments can do to stop getting in the way of new firm creation and more entrepreneurial practice opportunity in established firm. Then with regard to the least advantaged there are lot of things the government could do there too. First of all a healthier economy I think would by itself create more jobs for the less advantaged and pull up pay rates of the less advantaged. But in addition the governments in Europe could do a lot more than they’re doing – and also in the United States – could do a lot more than they’re doing now to address the problem of low wages and low employment among the disadvantaged.";838;Free time
I’m going jump back to something now and I’m going ask you to think of being even more magnanimous than you have been now, talking about the causes you would dedicate time to. Since 1999 the economics prize has been always a shared prize which makes you break a trend here that we’ve seen. I just wanted to ask you if you could be so magnanimous, if you could choose one person to share your prize, who would it be?;"In the same subject?
Your choice.
Edmund Phelps: That’s an interesting question. You see I think the people that I used to feel myself in a friendly rivalry with in my own generation have pretty much all got the Nobel Prize now. I’m the caboose that came along. When you though the train was all done there comes the caboose there, so I don’t think there’s anybody … I’m not sure that in my generation there’s anybody my age that I can immediately think of. But I could jump to younger people: Philippe Aghion, a young French economist now at Harvard, is doing highly original work on innovation and productivity. I’d have been happy to share it with him. And I was half expecting that if I got the prize I would share it with two people with whom I worked in the 1970s at Columbia: Guillermo Calvo and John Taylor. We worked on something called the New Keynesian Economics. What it means is just that we built on the idea that firms don’t adjust their wage rates all together at a certain day of the year the way they do in Japan with the Spring Offensive. Firms adjust their wage rates maybe annually but at different times in the year. That led to quite a lot of significant work so I thought possibly I would share with Calvo and Taylor. Earlier in my career when I was working on economic growth I worked with Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter and I once or twice imagined that I’d share it with them. That would also have made me … I would have been perfectly content about that. But I have to say, Rupini, it’s great to win it alone.";838;The impact of nobel on you
So how did all start? Why did you decide to become economists? Was it just a coincidence or was it something that you had planned for a long time?;"I certainly didn’t plan for it when I was almost through with high school, I had done pretty well in mathematics and I thought I would become an engineer. But then through various coincidences I ended up studying at the business school, Norges Handelshøyskole, and still then I didn’t think I would become an economist. I assumed this was an education that would lead up to a management position somewhere, maybe become a director of some company. And I just happened to take an advanced seminar from a very exciting professor, Sten Thore, exciting and excitable. He had us read very interesting and advanced papers in management science, operations research and I wrote my first FORTRAN programme using dynamic programming.
Then just before I was done, he came and asked me to become his research assistant and I followed him to Carnegie Mellon where he went on leave for a year and decided I had to get a piece too to make it in this field. So I never applied anywhere other than Carnegie Mellon. And then that was another great fortune because Carnegie Mellon has such a great research training programme, rather than doing all kinds of courses they get you started on doing papers right away. And so I did a first year and second year research paper and got them both published, and that’s a great start.
Certainly. And you Professor Prescott, how did you start?
Edward C Prescott: Tend to be drifting in, into that field. When I went to college it was the Sputnik era, so everybody wanted to go into physics.  I was in that programme at Swarthmore College and was in the honours programme in my junior year and I decided I didn’t like laboratories. I didn’t like sitting in there all day being very careful and meticulous. And so I said, Well, I’ll major in math. I did have a very good special teacher, one course and sort of engineering economics or engineering science, tied to management, Sam Carpenter.
And so I went to get a degree in operations research, which was a new field of applying mathematical tools and modelling tools to management problems. And then I went to Carnegie Mellon, it was Carnegie Tech then. It’s a multi-disciplinary programme, a minimal number of course requirements. I don’t know if they had any course requirements, but you had to take a certain number of exams in different areas. But then I got attracted to the people in Economics because it seemed to be where the action was. Bob Lucas came as an assistant professor the same year I came as a graduate student.
It must’ve been a very interesting period there at Carnegie Mellon at the end of the 60’s.
Edward C Prescott: Yes. Actually I was thinking about going into artificial intelligence because that was an exciting field there, too. And took some of Alan Newell and Herb Simon’s courses in that field. So then I ended up in economics.";841;Motivation
I know of course that you were Finn’s advisor, but I’m really very curious about this time inconsistency, or consistency result, however you like to put it. How did you start with this in the first place? I know you produced the thing in Bergen in 1975, but I guess you had some idea, why you just picked this problem and you got together in Bergen in ‘75?;"There was a change. We recognised that thinking in terms of using these old system of equation models, waiting to say What should you do now? was not a question in the language of economics. But you could evaluate rules. So the obvious question is what’s the best rule? And so we set out to find that. And the finding was that there was no best rule because you’re dealing with people who anticipate and think. Initially we were a little disappointed because we didn’t find what we were searching for, but then we thought, this is a neat result.
Do you have any comment on that?
Finn E Kydland: And then I had already encountered the time inconsistency issue in my thesis. I had looked around for a thesis topic, at that time the people were worried about something called the assignment problem and it had to do with does monetary policy and fiscal policy, what do they target? But there seemed to be no coherence to that literature in my opinion and so I decided to formulate the problem as a dynamic game between monetary and fiscal policy makers, because of the way decisions are made it seemed that the fiscal policy maker would be, what I would call, the dumber player. And right away it was a model in which the optimal policy for the fiscal policy maker was time inconsistent. In the long run I didn’t regard that particular application as that interesting. I dabbled around also with oligopoly theory with a dominant player, there’s literature on dominant player industries. And again the issue was very much prominent. The dominant player’s optimal plan was not time consistent.
But it became a much more interesting issue once we thought about having the government as a whole as the dominant player, sort of playing against the rest of the economy. And there were followers. It was not without challenges because once you do so and you want to do it right, you want to make sure that you don’t treat the rest of the economy as one player, they’ve got to be viewed as atomistic, so we struggled for a little bit with that issue, but it became a methodology that was very useful both for that particular paper and what was to come later.";841;Creativity
When you submitted the paper did you then, at that time, know that this is really a discovery?;Finn E Kydland: I was pretty sure it was an interesting discovery. We had written the first draft of the paper. I’d gone back to Norway and I arranged for Ed to come and visit for a year and we wrote that paper. And then I decided to talk about it at a conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in May of 1975. And this was a conference with quite prominent people in the field of economics and control theory, which was quite popular in those days. It’s true the title was kind of inflammatory, initially it was something about the inapplicability of control theory to policy making. So maybe that set them off. But anyway, everyone in the audience thought the result was wrong and a huge discussion ensued and I of course knew I was correct. But the fact that problem people such as Dan Fisher, Gregory Chow and others, David Kendrick, thought it was wrong, that just made it clear this had to be pretty big.;841;Research
How important do you think that your time consistency result has been for the subsequent central bank reforms?;"Edward C Prescott: Not sure, but they always use it as justification. And if we help in a little way bringing about these reforms, we’re proud of what we’ve contributed. They have moved in that direction and really what the people say, including the head of the Bank of England for example and /- – -/, at the Central Bank here in Sweden, I never heard Greenspan say anything specific about it but many people on the board of governors articulate these views strongly and push in this direction of a good rule and along with the independents, then you can follow it.
Do you want to add anything?
Finn E Kydland: I have done a little travelling in South America and to me, I’ve seen the contrast between countries in which they haven’t worried too much yet about following your rule or trying to make policy credible, and one sees how much a nation can be hurt by not doing so. And so that’s very depressing. Now exactly what to do about the ones you have lost your credibility, it’s not so easy. But at the same time it provides a contrast where I guess we are quite convinced that in nations where they use transparent polices where one has a good idea about what’s going to happen in the next 5 or 10 years, those nations will be much better off. And if this theory has served to lay the foundation for making them convinced of that, that’s rather better.";841;Research
The second part of your prize concerns business cycle theory. How do you think that this branch of economics has developed since your pioneering article?;"Edward C Prescott: I think in the pioneering article we developed a methodology. I’d look at what was done just a couple of years before, a statement from, for example, Lucas and Sergeant, who were attuned to the modern dynamic economic theory with the rational expectations. Just bringing that macro with the growth things just clicked and in the way we sort of matched things up with the national accounts and the growth facts and looking at the same set of statistics. And in the process a huge amount has been learned and there’s a multitude of studies within the framework.
We happened to focus jointly on the consequences of total factor productivity shocks, but Finn and others have focused on monetary factors, bringing them into that same analytic framework using it in the same tools and techniques. And in the process there’s discipline, theory tells you the answer. You have guesses, you have conjectures, and sometimes they’re right, sometimes they’re wrong. You don’t know until you quantitatively, it’s a big word, quantitatively, work things out. And we developed a way to do that. I think that was a key contribution.
Finn E Kydland: Yes, initially of course the theory was relatively simple, although we put in a few bells and whistles that we thought could be important for other business cycle questions we were studying. Since then economists have made great progress in expanding the set of questions you can ask. For example we made the assumption for attract ability and it turned out there was an assumption that didn’t matter for the answer that everyone is alike and is immortal.
Since then computing capability has expanded, knowledge of theories, the theoretical framework has been expanded so that it’s easy to bring to bear what we know about life cycle behaviour, for questions where we know that’s important. And they seem to go about these studies and using the same methodology. It’s just that the framework has been expanded.";841;The impact of nobel on you
Swedes have a problem now, we have only two Laureates in Economics. We have three in Norway in now and well, today we can’t do very much about that. But I would like to know, did you know Frisch or Haavelmo, have they inspired you or have you heard them lecture?;"Finn E Kydland: I once heard Frisch lecture. When I was an undergraduate at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration, Frisch came to give a guest lecture and I and a lot of the undergraduates went to hear him. The auditorium A, as it was called, was filled to capacity and I still remember Frisch coming in, in a dark blue suit and jogging shoes. And he sounded very excited about what he did. But I have to admit that at that time I didn’t know much about what he was famous for.
Since then I have read some of his works, I was especially impressed by his paper in the castle volume. It’s a beautiful precursor of what was to come and I suspect that people had followed his lead more than some of the others in the ‘30’s. The development of macroeconomics would not have taken as long as it did. And also, of course, Frisch was instrumental in starting the Econometric Society and he was the editor for 25 years, and that became probably the most prominent society in Economics. Haavelmo, I didn’t know quite as well and I have to admit that what he got the prize for is sort of further removed from what I do. Although I have written other things by him, his work on development theory and investment theory is quite impressive. But I don’t believe I ever met him. But I would like to point out that I think Norwegians are proud of the per capita number of Nobel Prizes in Economics. We now have one per 1,5 million people and that would be hard to beat.
Edward C Prescott: I thought Frisch was the great one. He had the vision, making economics quantitative. I guess it was neoclassic economics quantitative. Back then there were different schools of thought in economics. Now there’s only one. And when they started the Econometric Journal for 25 years that was really the only scientific journal in economics and the leadership he provided. But I don’t think his vision was really realised until after that time the bill paper, then we can start doing the things he wanted to be able to do, really disciplined, providing these quantitative answers to public policy questions. He was very frustrated in the ‘60‘s and he would talk that as much progress was not being made in providing enough discipline and he referred to player metrics, or that
term. But that’s just out of frustration that he wanted economists to be able to do so much more than they were able to do then. But now we can.";841;Environment
So when do you think the first woman will receive the prize in memory of Alfred Nobel?;"Edward C Prescott: Could be any year. I really can’t say who my candidate is. I can think of a couple of others in the pipeline that are 10 or 15 years away. But it could be anytime. There’s one that could’ve gotten it, but then she became a little bit extreme Maoist, but she had done some important economic research on the monopolists in competition many years before, Joan Robinson. I suspect if she didn’t have the, I think the Nobel Prize committee may have been a little bit nervous about the political thing, not the gender thing. They would love to.
Finn E Kydland: It is gratifying to see so many women coming into the field and in some nations more than others. When I’ve been to Spain, Italy and so on, it seems that the proportion has gone up to about 50%. And one has to remember that what you tend to get the prize for still is work you did 20 or 25 years ago, as was the case for us. And so if this is a recent trend then that by itself will delay the process. But it’s going to happen pretty soon.";841;Impact of the Nobel on you
So what kind of research do you do today? Has your interest shifted over the years?;"Edward C Prescott: Methodology, no. Topic, yes. One thing I was quite excited about is this research with Ellen McGrattan on the stock market valuation. The business cycle model says what the value of the stock market should be and, you know, I had to a few things, put in a corporates sector, you have to build in the tax system, because it turns out to be important and also a regulatory constraint. And the theory just does spectacularly well. But that sort of shifted the more interest in the bigger movements. Prosperities and depressions, these large movements in relative levels. Then I’ll be coming back to this problem about why isn’t the whole world rich type things?
And it seems to be barriers to riches. All the groups of people, no matter what nation they live in, if they can set up a good system, they’re rich. They become rich very quickly. But it’s related to the time inconsistency, it’s easier said than done, in what sort of institutions that might be set up that mitigates the creations of these barriers to efficient production. If you look at across countries, you can determine living standards just by knowing how much output is produced per hour worked. The amount of hours worked per person doesn’t vary that much, but the amount produced per hour can vary by a factor of 25 between the rich and the poor. And the relative productivity can change pretty fast, as we know from the growth miracles in Asia. And there were some growth miracles in Europe too after the World War II. The Italians, the German recovery.
Finn E Kydland: I might mention two things. One is there has been this belief that monetary policy affects the real economy and I was pondering how can it be there are so many people believe that out there and that it’s so hard to find a good propagation mechanism as Frisch would have called it. And so I’ve been searching to see if a few factors could be quantitatively important. One is working through the interaction with the fiscal tax system, for example if they’re non-indexed, which was the case in the US in the ‘60’s and the ‘70’s especially, but then the tax system changed somewhat in the last 20 years. And low and behold, it turned out that you can get some quantitative effects before the early ‘80’s.
It’s interesting that the investment in durables usually bought with loans, the cyclical behaviour is different depending on whether the nation has for some reason or other fixed normal interest rate loans as opposed to flexible interest rate loans. And that may lead one to wonder whether monetary policy or monetary shocks may have had an effect. But in the vein of what Ed talked about, what I found, Ed has studied the world as a whole and compared wealth and incomes all over the world. For various reasons I got interested in particular countries, and so I already mentioned Argentina which I have studied intensively and it’s fascinating but also depressing to study a country that used to be one of the richest nations in the world, and now has a population that is by usual classifications, it contains 40 or 50% who are poor. And why is that and what can be learnt for other nations? Then we have the contrast with Ireland, which used to be poor, and now has become one of the richest nations in the world. So I think one can learn by choosing particular countries to study.";841;Future research (interests)
You have worked a little against the mainstream. You talked about this conference in Cambridge. And they thought it was wrong and they got irritated by your business cycle results. But would you give a person advice to really lean against the mainstream or would you give them any other advice?;"Finn E Kydland: Yes certainly. You’ve got to do what you believe is going to lead to scientific progress. And we believed strongly that this was the way to go. But if the framework already is a reasonable one for the questions you want to address, there’s not much point in trying to lean against it just for the purpose of leaning.
Edward C Prescott: We listen to criticism and if some unfortunate criticism comes up, we fess up to it.";841;Creativity
I’ve heard that you are a big football enthusiast, so if you had to choose Norway winning the world championships or you winning the Nobel Prize, what will you choose?;Finn E Kydland: That question is too easy. I wish I would choose the Nobel Prize, but a Norwegian journalist just after the prize was announced asked a harder question, if you could choose to be who you are and win the Nobel Prize, or be a world famous soccer player? Then, and that’s a much harder question (laugh). So if I could be Martin Palermo or Tore Andre Flo or someone like that, that will make it hard (laugh).;841;Impact of the Nobel on you
I guess that you, Professor Prescott, have been interested in soccer?;Edward C Prescott: Yes I got involved in soccer. Soccer was not played much when I was younger, but it’s become a big time sport in the US. I guess I got drafted into that organisation, to coach a team at something and stuck with them. They’re just a great group of kids. I used to make some of my graduate students help me referee or coach, we paid them. I made my sons help out the coach. It’s hard when you want to get the people to do this and the team that I manage was just the greatest group of kids and really talented athletic-wise. And so they can play with the best clubs in the world, including ones from Sweden, and Norway. We hosted a team from Norway, they have the biggest youth tournament over there in Minneapolis in the world.  Sweden has big ones too I understand.;841;Creativity

But I would like to point out that I think Norwegians are proud of the per capita number of Nobel Prizes in Economics. We now have one per 1,5 million people and that would be hard to beat.
Edward C Prescott: I thought Frisch was the great one. He had the vision, making economics quantitative. I guess it was neoclassic economics quantitative. Back then there were different schools of thought in economics. Now there’s only one. And when they started the Econometric Journal for 25 years that was really the only scientific journal in economics and the leadership he provided. But I don’t think his vision was really realised until after that time the bill paper, then we can start doing the things he wanted to be able to do, really disciplined, providing these quantitative answers to public policy questions. He was very frustrated in the ‘60‘s and he would talk that as much progress was not being made in providing enough discipline and he referred to player metrics, or that
term. But that’s just out of frustration that he wanted economists to be able to do so much more than they were able to do then. But now we can.";842;Environment
So when do you think the first woman will receive the prize in memory of Alfred Nobel?;"Edward C Prescott: Could be any year. I really can’t say who my candidate is. I can think of a couple of others in the pipeline that are 10 or 15 years away. But it could be anytime. There’s one that could’ve gotten it, but then she became a little bit extreme Maoist, but she had done some important economic research on the monopolists in competition many years before, Joan Robinson. I suspect if she didn’t have the, I think the Nobel Prize committee may have been a little bit nervous about the political thing, not the gender thing. They would love to.
Finn E Kydland: It is gratifying to see so many women coming into the field and in some nations more than others. When I’ve been to Spain, Italy and so on, it seems that the proportion has gone up to about 50%. And one has to remember that what you tend to get the prize for still is work you did 20 or 25 years ago, as was the case for us. And so if this is a recent trend then that by itself will delay the process. But it’s going to happen pretty soon.";842;Impact of the Nobel on you
So what kind of research do you do today? Has your interest shifted over the years?;"Edward C Prescott: Methodology, no. Topic, yes. One thing I was quite excited about is this research with Ellen McGrattan on the stock market valuation. The business cycle model says what the value of the stock market should be and, you know, I had to a few things, put in a corporates sector, you have to build in the tax system, because it turns out to be important and also a regulatory constraint. And the theory just does spectacularly well. But that sort of shifted the more interest in the bigger movements. Prosperities and depressions, these large movements in relative levels. Then I’ll be coming back to this problem about why isn’t the whole world rich type things?
And it seems to be barriers to riches. All the groups of people, no matter what nation they live in, if they can set up a good system, they’re rich. They become rich very quickly. But it’s related to the time inconsistency, it’s easier said than done, in what sort of institutions that might be set up that mitigates the creations of these barriers to efficient production. If you look at across countries, you can determine living standards just by knowing how much output is produced per hour worked. The amount of hours worked per person doesn’t vary that much, but the amount produced per hour can vary by a factor of 25 between the rich and the poor. And the relative productivity can change pretty fast, as we know from the growth miracles in Asia. And there were some growth miracles in Europe too after the World War II. The Italians, the German recovery.
Finn E Kydland: I might mention two things. One is there has been this belief that monetary policy affects the real economy and I was pondering how can it be there are so many people believe that out there and that it’s so hard to find a good propagation mechanism as Frisch would have called it. And so I’ve been searching to see if a few factors could be quantitatively important. One is working through the interaction with the fiscal tax system, for example if they’re non-indexed, which was the case in the US in the ‘60’s and the ‘70’s especially, but then the tax system changed somewhat in the last 20 years. And low and behold, it turned out that you can get some quantitative effects before the early ‘80’s.
It’s interesting that the investment in durables usually bought with loans, the cyclical behaviour is different depending on whether the nation has for some reason or other fixed normal interest rate loans as opposed to flexible interest rate loans. And that may lead one to wonder whether monetary policy or monetary shocks may have had an effect. But in the vein of what Ed talked about, what I found, Ed has studied the world as a whole and compared wealth and incomes all over the world. For various reasons I got interested in particular countries, and so I already mentioned Argentina which I have studied intensively and it’s fascinating but also depressing to study a country that used to be one of the richest nations in the world, and now has a population that is by usual classifications, it contains 40 or 50% who are poor. And why is that and what can be learnt for other nations? Then we have the contrast with Ireland, which used to be poor, and now has become one of the richest nations in the world. So I think one can learn by choosing particular countries to study.";842;Future research (interests)
You have worked a little against the mainstream. You talked about this conference in Cambridge. And they thought it was wrong and they got irritated by your business cycle results. But would you give a person advice to really lean against the mainstream or would you give them any other advice?;"Finn E Kydland: Yes certainly. You’ve got to do what you believe is going to lead to scientific progress. And we believed strongly that this was the way to go. But if the framework already is a reasonable one for the questions you want to address, there’s not much point in trying to lean against it just for the purpose of leaning.
Edward C Prescott: We listen to criticism and if some unfortunate criticism comes up, we fess up to it.";842;Creativity
I’ve heard that you are a big football enthusiast, so if you had to choose Norway winning the world championships or you winning the Nobel Prize, what will you choose?;Finn E Kydland: That question is too easy. I wish I would choose the Nobel Prize, but a Norwegian journalist just after the prize was announced asked a harder question, if you could choose to be who you are and win the Nobel Prize, or be a world famous soccer player? Then, and that’s a much harder question (laugh). So if I could be Martin Palermo or Tore Andre Flo or someone like that, that will make it hard (laugh).;842;Impact of the Nobel on you
I guess that you, Professor Prescott, have been interested in soccer?;Edward C Prescott: Yes I got involved in soccer. Soccer was not played much when I was younger, but it’s become a big time sport in the US. I guess I got drafted into that organisation, to coach a team at something and stuck with them. They’re just a great group of kids. I used to make some of my graduate students help me referee or coach, we paid them. I made my sons help out the coach. It’s hard when you want to get the people to do this and the team that I manage was just the greatest group of kids and really talented athletic-wise. And so they can play with the best clubs in the world, including ones from Sweden, and Norway. We hosted a team from Norway, they have the biggest youth tournament over there in Minneapolis in the world.  Sweden has big ones too I understand.;842;Creativity
To my knowledge none of you has studied economics as undergraduates and this means that you have a background in another discipline. How did that affect your research when you were doing?;"Robert Engle: In fact, when I was an undergraduate, I was a physics major and I had lots of room mates and friends who studied economics and they kept telling me I should take an economics class so I could find out what this was really like. So, my senior year I had a choice between taking a religion class and economics class because I had an extra spot, and I took economics and it was fascinating. That was my first actual experience and that’s probably why I ended up doing the switch. But then when I did my switch from physics to economics I took pretty much a full set of undergraduate classes on a listening basis while I was taking the graduate courses.
Clive Granger: I had just one third of my first undergraduate year in economics which I enjoyed and it was a very non-mathematical approach. I kept trying to translate into my mathematics that I was more used to and I had trouble doing that, but I enjoyed what I did. I always felt that it was both a disadvantage not to know economics and an advantage because economists think about things differently than everybody else, but also when I came to economics proper I came to it in a different way than all my colleagues did and I think that added an extra dimension to the approach. Then in pair with economists together we would then have a wider way of looking at things and so it was both a disadvantage and an advantage.";843;Life
Has any particular teacher really been important to you? As an undergraduate or graduate?;"Clive Granger: Yes, when I was undergraduate my professor was Brian Tew who was a very good macroeconomist in England and he was one of these people who was totally non-analytical but he was appreciative of mathematical methods. He was very /- – -/ believed the future was in a more mathematical, technical approach to economics. At Princeton I worked with Oscar Morgenstern and he was a great man and had very wide interests and again he didn’t teach me any game theory, I learnt some again just being around him and others. But I found that his leadership was just magnificent.
Robert Engle: I guess the teachers that I would like to mention were my couple of teachers at Cornell in graduate school. The very first day I arrived there I met my thesis supervisor whose name is Ta Chung Liu or as you would say in Chinese Liu Ta Chung and he was a wonderful mentor to me. He was interested in econometrics as a tool to do real problems. He was building models of the US economy and the Chinese economy and you could really see that this was a tool that could solve problems. Then two other men that were really very important were Berndt Stigum who is now in Oslo and was really a great inspiration in teaching a lot of the advanced econometrics that I later used, and John Fei who really gave me my introduction to some of the more traditional economic areas.";843;Mentors (Role models)
Some researchers work in teams and some others do more alone work, how does a usual workday look for you?;"Robert Engle: I write a surprisingly large number of papers with my students. I like taking a graduate student and just starting on a project at early stages of their career and then slowly it develops and we get a little further and little further and little further and by the time maybe two years has gone by we have a paper, or maybe three years. Then pretty soon maybe there’s a new important idea that they do. That’s one way I do it. But the other way, which is a wonderful way to do it, is to collaborate with colleagues like Clive and we’ve had an awful lot of wonderful times just talking about big problems and how could you solve this and how could we solve that? I’ve seen this thing and what do you make of this? I don’t know what I make of that, what do you make of it? We just kind of go round and round in circles and all of a sudden there’s something new there.
Clive Granger: I second that totally. Occasionally I spend time just by myself playing with a model and just trying different alternative approaches. But I’ve had over 80 collaborators with my publications over the years, so you see I get along well with people and together we produce. When I was at Nottingham recently, I was there just by myself for quite some years and then Paul Newbold arrived and the difference in my ability to produce and to get my ideas was greatly enhanced by two of us, two of us was much better than two single individuals. Then I moved to San Diego and then I had a year there where I was by myself and then Rob came along and suddenly everything blossomed and we could interact and be very productive. Then we have some very great students come along and the whole thing was just built up. So the answer is there’s no single answer, we do both individual work to initially begin a project but then the discussion and interaction and throwing ideas out to people is very nice. One thing we did at San Diego was to have a regular lunchtime meeting every Tuesday of all the econometricians and we always tried to make that meeting and it was a totally un-programmed meeting, we just would go along and see what one talk about. It was a great help to people, sometimes we’d talk about nothing. just sport or something, but other days it was a really interesting meeting and visitors would come along to it and that was I think a helpful thing to do.
Robert Engle: We also did some gossip at these meetings.
Clive Granger: Don’t tell that!
Robert Engle: Who was running around with whose wife or switching universities or what was happening so … a lot of things happened!";843;Creativity
According to Nobel you are supposed to have done a discovery to be awarded the prize and I think this time it is obvious that both cointegration and ARCH is really a discovery, but when did you find out or how did you find out that this was really something that could change the way statistics and also financial econometrics could be?;"Clive Granger: Certainly the cointegration idea was one of these things that once it became clear that we understood what we’d found and what the implication of it were to other things that it solved many problems. Things that we were being puzzled about beforehand, we were seeing papers which were inconclusive and people didn’t know quite what to do with their data, suddenly we found we found we could solve all those problems. It became clear how to explain all many things. I think almost within days we both realised that this was going to be an important discovery. Exactly how you sell that is another question but I think we had no doubt how important are the question but we were excited by it and we quickly told people about it and other people were excited by it. Word spread quite quickly on that, on this cointegration.
What about ARCH?
Robert Engle: Arch really came about when I was on leave on sabbatical from San Diego at the London School of Economics but it was stimulated by things we had been doing in San Diego beforehand and it was a project I was working on and kind of in the back of my mind. I had a project in the front of my mind that I felt like I had to do first before I could really think about this time-varying volatility question. Then my wonderful student Mark Watson wrote me a letter I guess, couldn’t have been email in those days, saying that he really wanted to figure out the first problem that I felt I had to solve first for his thesis. I thought to myself, hm, if I let him work on that then I can try to work on this other thing that I’m interested in and all of a sudden I had days of empty time ahead of me and I had these ideas that I wanted to build models of time-varying variances and I had a lot of external stimulation from people at the London School of Economics and all of a sudden the idea came, got put together and it was just very exciting. I did feel like that was important too although that is an idea that it seems to me it took a lot more time for the profession to realise it was interesting than the cointegration idea where everybody just jumped on it.";843;Impact of Nobel on you
You seem to talk a lot about students and I wonder what would the dream student be for you?;"Robert Engle: You know students are very deceptive, it’s not necessarily the ones that do the best in class that are best to work with. What I find is that there is this transition that students go through, that at the beginning you’re explaining things to them. I always like them to have taken my class so that we’re talking a common language. Then at the beginning I keep explaining to them and I always like talking about things I don’t understand, how could we think about it, this way or that way? They have something to say or they don’t have something to say. Then in a few short months all of a sudden they’re explaining things to me or maybe a year or two later: Could you explain that to me again? They’ll tell me again sort of why this is the right answer. That’s the dream student for me.
Clive Granger: I find some students are very compatible, that you talk to them and you’re very comfortable talking to them. They’re just naturally intelligent and they absorb what’s being said and initially they’re taking everything from you. Then slowly your relationship changes and you find that they’re doing more than you asked, they’re bringing back to you more than you expected and they have their own results which you say Wow, I didn’t realise that was going to occur from this problem. That’s great and you’ve established somebody on the road to doing good research and you know they’re going to have good ideas from thereon.
Robert Engle: Another thing to say along the same lines is that when you’re working on something that’s new and actually that’s mostly what we’re doing, you’re headed into the uncharted area so you don’t really know what’s going to happen and some students get stuck a lot and you spend all your time with them trying to get them unstuck. Other people seem to avoid getting stuck, they figure out a way around it or get a good idea sometimes that you sort of think back on, you say Wow, you know we really made a lot of progress, versus in the first case Oh, there are all these roads blocks, road blocks, road blocks, we couldn’t get anywhere. I think that’s actually an important quality that students can have and we have to have ourselves as we develop in these areas.";843;Competencies
As I see it, it has been a fantastic develop in econometrics during say the last 20, 30 years, this is not the first prize in econometrics. What would you say, computers, better computers, has that contributed to this or is there something else?;"Clive Granger: We discussed this in the past when computers first became rather fast, the data became more plentiful we wondered whether there were going to be lots of fantastic results appearing. New things about the economics were appearing and it hasn’t really quite happened as to the extent we expect. We can now think of quite different ways to approach econometrics, we’re not having the constraints we used to have on computing and often data availability now. Whereas at one time it was an effort to do analysis with 100 pieces of data for a single series, now if you go out with 400 pieces of data and 500 series at the same time and have this enormous paper and how much better that is than the one series done properly is not always so clear. We learn a bit more but not a huge amount more, so I think we haven’t yet learnt how to best summarise and how to best search this extra tool. It’s going to get worse because we start dealing with multi-freight distributions next and even to describe some of these things and to know, we’ll have a lot of results we can’t even look at. It’ll be too complicated for anyone to look at the results, they’ll be on the computer, we can ask the computer question about what the results say to us but they’ll be too complicated, they’re just too numerous. We have to learn how to deal with that situation and that’s exciting, in my opinion that’s something which the physicists have faced for many years, they have multi-dimensions and too many data points. We haven’t quite got there yet.
Robert Engle: In time series one of the things that happened is that the big macro-models were pretty much static models or almost static models. They had very simple kinds of dynamics in them and when people started to look at how well they forecast especially short run forecasting they found out that very simple time series models could out-perform the static which I would call traditional macro econometric models. By thinking about this short-run forecasting problem it gives you a different way of formulating econometric models. Econometric models are formulated very largely in terms of given what we know today what’s tomorrow likely to look like, so you build up these models in what we call recursive fashion. That point of view gives rise to an awful lot of these developments and time series, so it maybe just that change in formulation that’s given rise to a variety of different things.";843;Research
Doing research is certainly good exercise for the brain, what other kind of exercise do you do?;"Robert Engle: You’ve been peeking! We both do a lot of other kinds of exercise but one of the things that I love to do is ice dancing and you’ve probably seen some of it here in this Nobel Week, film footage and I’ve been adult competitive ice dancer for many, many years and it’s a wonderful escape from my economics. My skating friends don’t know that I do economics and my economics friends don’t know that I skate, it’s like you just change your personality and that lets your brain relax and other things happen and then when you come back to work its fresh.
Clive Granger: I’ve nothing as spectacular as this to discuss but every day I try and walk on the beach for half an hour, one of the advantages of San Diego it’s very relaxing on the beach. The sound’s nice and the whole atmosphere’s nice and in the summer the water’s quite warm in San Diego so all 25 years, every day in the summer I’ve surfed, I’ve body surfed, I call it body surfing it’s really not that spectacular but it’s fun and it’s very good exercise.
Robert Engle: You take a boogie board don’t you?
Clive Granger: No, I just use my body, just lie on the surf. It’s fun and I really enjoy it and exercise that you enjoy doing you do, and you have a good time and you come back and you’re fitter from doing it.
Don’t you enjoy art too?
Clive Granger: Yes, I go to art galleries quite a lot, whenever I’m in a city on a conference I always put half a day aside if I can and go to that local art gallery and look, I’m not expert in art I just like looking at art. It’s relaxing.
Do you talk a lot about economics at home or what kind of discussions?
Robert Engle: My wife’s not much of an economist; I don’t think Pat is either.
Clive Granger: Not at all, no. How to spend the household money is one of the problems!
Robert Engle: The closest we come to an economic discussion is talk about how was your day and all this sort of things. Then I’ll say something like You know, I had a good idea today and she’ll say Oh really, oh that’s great. Because a good idea to me is so exciting and she knows it’s exciting and she appreciates that, and it feels like a real accomplishment to her as well as to me.
Clive Granger: I’m told off for working too long and too hard and I go away in my study and do my own thing but that’s all, we don’t discuss economics at all.";843;Life
But you have children both of you and are they economists or academics?;"Clive Granger: My daughter is on the edge of an academic career. She’s a science writer and she’s thinking about working in the university doing administrative type academic jobs. My son’s a programmer or developer of animation programmes, so he’s not academic at all but quite successful.
Robert Engle: My daughter took a class at Princeton from Helen Blinder and was very interested in it and I got my anticipation up a little bit but she decided that wasn’t what she wanted to do. She’s just finished her PhD in cognitive psychology at UCLA and I think wants to be a professor so I feel like there’s some carry over there even though it’s not economics. My son took an economics class at Williams and after he was done he said, You know Dad I really learned something important in this class – that I’m never going to be an economist! So, he’s more on the creative side and he wants to be an actor and has been doing a lot of high-level photography and pursuing a more creative career.";843;Motivation

What would you say, computers, better computers, has that contributed to this or is there something else?;"Clive Granger: We discussed this in the past when computers first became rather fast, the data became more plentiful we wondered whether there were going to be lots of fantastic results appearing. New things about the economics were appearing and it hasn’t really quite happened as to the extent we expect. We can now think of quite different ways to approach econometrics, we’re not having the constraints we used to have on computing and often data availability now. Whereas at one time it was an effort to do analysis with 100 pieces of data for a single series, now if you go out with 400 pieces of data and 500 series at the same time and have this enormous paper and how much better that is than the one series done properly is not always so clear. We learn a bit more but not a huge amount more, so I think we haven’t yet learnt how to best summarise and how to best search this extra tool. It’s going to get worse because we start dealing with multi-freight distributions next and even to describe some of these things and to know, we’ll have a lot of results we can’t even look at. It’ll be too complicated for anyone to look at the results, they’ll be on the computer, we can ask the computer question about what the results say to us but they’ll be too complicated, they’re just too numerous. We have to learn how to deal with that situation and that’s exciting, in my opinion that’s something which the physicists have faced for many years, they have multi-dimensions and too many data points. We haven’t quite got there yet.
Robert Engle: In time series one of the things that happened is that the big macro-models were pretty much static models or almost static models. They had very simple kinds of dynamics in them and when people started to look at how well they forecast especially short run forecasting they found out that very simple time series models could out-perform the static which I would call traditional macro econometric models. By thinking about this short-run forecasting problem it gives you a different way of formulating econometric models. Econometric models are formulated very largely in terms of given what we know today what’s tomorrow likely to look like, so you build up these models in what we call recursive fashion. That point of view gives rise to an awful lot of these developments and time series, so it maybe just that change in formulation that’s given rise to a variety of different things.";844;Research
Doing research is certainly good exercise for the brain, what other kind of exercise do you do?;"Robert Engle: You’ve been peeking! We both do a lot of other kinds of exercise but one of the things that I love to do is ice dancing and you’ve probably seen some of it here in this Nobel Week, film footage and I’ve been adult competitive ice dancer for many, many years and it’s a wonderful escape from my economics. My skating friends don’t know that I do economics and my economics friends don’t know that I skate, it’s like you just change your personality and that lets your brain relax and other things happen and then when you come back to work its fresh.
Clive Granger: I’ve nothing as spectacular as this to discuss but every day I try and walk on the beach for half an hour, one of the advantages of San Diego it’s very relaxing on the beach. The sound’s nice and the whole atmosphere’s nice and in the summer the water’s quite warm in San Diego so all 25 years, every day in the summer I’ve surfed, I’ve body surfed, I call it body surfing it’s really not that spectacular but it’s fun and it’s very good exercise.
Robert Engle: You take a boogie board don’t you?
Clive Granger: No, I just use my body, just lie on the surf. It’s fun and I really enjoy it and exercise that you enjoy doing you do, and you have a good time and you come back and you’re fitter from doing it.
Don’t you enjoy art too?
Clive Granger: Yes, I go to art galleries quite a lot, whenever I’m in a city on a conference I always put half a day aside if I can and go to that local art gallery and look, I’m not expert in art I just like looking at art. It’s relaxing.
Do you talk a lot about economics at home or what kind of discussions?
Robert Engle: My wife’s not much of an economist; I don’t think Pat is either.
Clive Granger: Not at all, no. How to spend the household money is one of the problems!
Robert Engle: The closest we come to an economic discussion is talk about how was your day and all this sort of things. Then I’ll say something like You know, I had a good idea today and she’ll say Oh really, oh that’s great. Because a good idea to me is so exciting and she knows it’s exciting and she appreciates that, and it feels like a real accomplishment to her as well as to me.
Clive Granger: I’m told off for working too long and too hard and I go away in my study and do my own thing but that’s all, we don’t discuss economics at all.";844;Life
But you have children both of you and are they economists or academics?;"Clive Granger: My daughter is on the edge of an academic career. She’s a science writer and she’s thinking about working in the university doing administrative type academic jobs. My son’s a programmer or developer of animation programmes, so he’s not academic at all but quite successful.
Robert Engle: My daughter took a class at Princeton from Helen Blinder and was very interested in it and I got my anticipation up a little bit but she decided that wasn’t what she wanted to do. She’s just finished her PhD in cognitive psychology at UCLA and I think wants to be a professor so I feel like there’s some carry over there even though it’s not economics. My son took an economics class at Williams and after he was done he said, You know Dad I really learned something important in this class – that I’m never going to be an economist! So, he’s more on the creative side and he wants to be an actor and has been doing a lot of high-level photography and pursuing a more creative career.";844;Motivation
Well Professor Kahneman, what made you decide to become a scientist?;"Daniel Kahneman: I wanted to be a philosopher actually and I decided, I became interested in psychology as a substitute for philosophy, as a way of answering questions about the human condition but answering them by looking at facts rather than by discussing words. So that’s how I became a psychologist.
And Professor Smith, your answer too?
Vernon Smith: Actually I was interested in philosophy at one point. This is before I really was seriously into my undergraduate training, so it was just a reading interest of my own and I read Sir James Jeans’ Physics and Philosophy and Sir Arthur Eddington’s books and Burton Russell; I was interested in science and philosophy and originally I expected to study science and I went to Caltech for that reason and I did study physics and would have taken my degree in physics, my undergraduate degree, except for one hurdle.
So I took electrical engineering because I chickened out …
To take the degree in physics you had to take Smyth’s course, a famous course that was very, very hard to get through. By taking my degree in electrical engineering I didn’t have to take Smyth’s course but I took everything else in physics. So I took electrical engineering because I chickened out and I wanted to finish on time. But I got interested in economics as a senior; I took a course in economics and at the time I thought, well you know, this just looks like physics and little did I know how deceptive that was. But anyway that was my naïve view at the time.";845;Motivation
Well if we turn to your research. I mean one of you has shown that people are frequently irrational in their economic decision making and the other has shown that the market mechanism works efficiently, at least in the lab. How would you reconcile these seemingly different views, I mean both of you?;"Vernon Smith: Question to me?
To both of you.
Vernon Smith: Well, let me begin. I think it’s fairly simple. In experimental economics we have three classes of results. We have situations in which people do better for themselves as individuals and as a group and is predicted by economic theory. Ok. I call that super rationality. We have a second class of results where the predictions of economic theory do very well and they conform and I’ll come back to what those are shortly and thirdly we have results which people do not do as well as predicted by theory. The first is in two person extensive form games. We use the term personal exchange there. Too many people cooperate relative to the predictions of the economic, not everyone in single play games but up to half and so we have to come to terms with that. The experiments where the theory of markets does extremely well is where we’re talking about production and consumption markets; flows. We think of consumers as daily or regularly enjoying the value from what they buy in markets and producers regularly incurring a cost to produce that.
Those markets, if you study them in the lab are remarkable efficient and although their ability to converge to the equilibrium predicted by the theory varies with the institution, they basically all function quite well but the third class of phenomena where the predictions are not good is in what we call asset markets or capital markets and there’s an inherent uncertainty in stock markets and we capture that in these laboratory games and those do not converge quickly and easily to what you might call rational expectations equilibrium. If you hold the environment constant for kind of 3 times back, and now we’re talking about 6 hours of experiment, it gets home, ok, but that’s not very inspiring or encouraging because the world out there it doesn’t stand still while people look for the rational expectations equilibrium. So does that help to clarify?
Yes, I think so. Professor Kahneman?
Daniel Kahneman: Well the first comment I would make is about the word irrationality as characterising the research that we have done. I never think of myself as having demonstrated irrationality. There is a definition of rationality within the contest of economic theory or decision theory more broadly, which is a completely unrealistic conception of a human agent with a complete preference order about all states of the world, with a Bayesian set of beliefs about all possible states and this defines rationality in the context of economic theory.
Now as a descriptive hypothesis this is a totally implausible hypothesis and, you know, it is fairly easy to show that that hypothesis isn’t true and we’ve been doing that, my late colleague Amos Tversky and I, and many others. It’s also not particularly interesting to show that it isn’t true because it’s so easy to do. We have been able to show some of the ways in which people depart from this ideal of rationality but this is not irrationality. People are reasonable, they’re prudent agents. It’s just that the definition of rationality that is used in economic theory is, I think, a very implausible definition and it fails descriptively and we have been able to document some of these failures and explain them.";845;Creativity
"Both of you have worked in the frontier between different fields; economics and psychology and natural sciences with experiments. What kind of difficulties or what kind of challenges did that implement for you?";Well, I think if you are curious about some of the things we observe in economics and you want to better understand this phenomena, whether it’s in a laboratory or the field, I really think you have to reach outside of economics because economics, although it has an incredible body of technique it’s developed and the methodology that has value it’s much too, I think, restrictive to embrace the range of observations. So you have to reach outside and actually if you go back to the Scottish philosophers, David Hume and Adam Smith, they were not narrowly oriented in the way that we often think of as modern economics. Adam Smith had huge breadth. He wrote the definitive History of Astronomy, 18th century. He was probably the first great post Newtonian scientist and he wrote on other aspects of human sociality besides just what has become known as economics narrowly construed.;845;Creativity
I guess he was a philosopher of moral philosophy wasn’t he?;"Well, yes and of course we didn’t have a clear delineation of the fields like we have now. Well I think a lot of the work on experimental economics points us back to that period and a need to pick up on some of the inspiration that was behind people like Smith and Ferguson and Hume and others and I hope in fact my work will help to encourage that, not because they had it right, it’s because we know a lot more, obviously, after 200 years but there’s certain themes there that we’ve lost, that we’ve sort of abandoned and that’s unfortunate.
Professor Kahneman?
Daniel Kahneman: Amos Tversky and I started working together on the field of judgment and decision making and we were just doing psychology. So we were not intending to talk across the disciplines but eventually, and that came as a bit of a surprise to us, the work that we did was, to some extent, influential in economics. I mean this is of course why the prize is given because of the influence. Now what is remarkable to me about this is actually both the ease and the difficulty of communicating across disciplines. In our case I think we’ve had a very easy time. You know, it’s not that economists have flocked to the ideas that we’re bringing, you know, behavioural economics is a minority movement and not everybody is convinced of its value but by and large I would say that, you know, I have been quite surprised by, you know 20 years is a short time for ideas to have an effect and, you know, our ideas have had whatever influence they’ve had relatively quickly.
What impresses me is how chancy this is, that is this is entirely accidental, that is the communication if we had published exactly the same paper, which is cited in the award prospect theory, if we’d published that word for word in Psychological Review, in the Journal of Psychological Theory there would have been no Nobel Prize for this work today. So it was because it happened to be published in Econometrica that this happened.
But also the most cited paper in Econometric ever.
Daniel Kahneman: Yes, but in part it is a very highly cited paper. I should add, you know, this doesn’t make it all that influential in economics because most of the people who cite the paper are not economists. So I don’t know how many economists cited it; it’s a well known paper in economics as well but if it had been published in another discipline it would simply not have had an impact and I think this is in part what Vernon is saying, economists do not spontaneously look outside the discipline. So if you look at the journals that are cited in the economics literature they tend to be economics journals. So we were quite lucky, you know, in the sense that publishing in Econometrica and we did that because it was the prestige journal for decision theory at that time. We thought we had a good paper and so we sent it to the best journal that would publish it and we were then lucky in a completely different way in that a young and very brilliant economist, Richard Thaler, read about our work actually before it was published and was influenced by it and he really, not we, developed behavioural economics. So it was his doing and it was through his work that our work became known and he deserves a great deal of the credit for, you know, what’s happened since.";845;Mentor(Role Models)
Ok. Before we leave the research side of things, I mean you published your award winning papers before 50. Is there a life in research after 50 or is economics a young man’s game like mathematics?;"Well I think that’s probably not unusual across most of the prizes although I’m just conjecturing that that’s probably true. Certainly Albert Einstein had some of his basic instincts before he was of age and particularly I think that’s true in physics but it’s young minds that tend to get inspired. I think it also has to do with the sociology of professional work. It’s young people who chart new courses that change things. It’s not the existing scientific community that suddenly has a transformation and, you know, my friend Paul Samuelson points out that science progresses funeral by funeral.
Daniel Kahneman: Well, I mean to your question of whether there is life after 50, I certainly hope so. I think Vernon has done some of the work that, you know, has done wonderful work in very recent years so there may be life after 70 and, you know, to some extent this again is accidental and is self selection, that is if you are going to have people who are going to have important ideas, they may have them fairly early in their career and then they spend the rest of their careers elaborating on these ideas and so it looks as if, you know, people have their best ideas early on but that’s because they spend the rest of their lives working on them and I think, you know, this happens to most people who have one important theme to develop.
Vernon Smith: Well I think young people are sort of maybe more likely to make technical or mythological breakthroughs but just looking at my own history I didn’t really appreciate the full ramifications at the time I was doing that work. I didn’t come close to it and I think that can come with maturity so that the contribution you can make after aged 50, and I hope after age 75, is perhaps a different type of contribution than one makes when you’re younger.
Daniel Kahneman: Yes, I would echo that. It takes a long time to understand what you’ve been saying. So, you know, you say it first and then, over the years, you understand what it was that you really meant because you don’t know that immediately. In my particular case I was fortunate because there were two of us and that process of understanding what we said worked faster because we understood each other but when you work alone, understanding what you’re saying is a long drawn process.
Vernon Smith: Well and I recognise, understood early that a component of what I was doing had to do with institutions and rule systems but I didn’t begin to understand it the way I now do and a lot of that understanding came from interacting with other people over the years, Charlie Plott is a prime example, and also Martin Shubik, he and I are exactly the same age. I think I’ve known Martin for over 40 years, I think about 45 years and we often exchanged ideas, having to do with institutions and Martin was very interested in and that interchange was very valuable to me even though we never worked together and of course I worked with Charlie Plott and a lot of our insights came working together.";845;Motivation
Well how important has it been to you? I mean your scientific result can be applied to, what did Nobel say, to the benefit of mankind? I mean you followed your track, you found something that was interesting and pursued that?;"Daniel Kahneman: I would say that the conscious sense of doing something that could be truly beneficial, well I had that early on when I thought that people could be educated to think, you know, more closely and these efforts of mine have not been rewarded. In recent years I’m consciously trying to do something for the benefit of mankind and this is to develop new and better measures of human welfare and human wellbeing that could be applied as another measure of how society is doing and I’m doing that with collaborators, including an economist at Princeton, Alan Krueger, and that is truly with the idea of trying to do something that could be useful to policy making.
You have something to say Vernon?
… the laboratory is a very useful tool for allowing people to get experience …
Vernon Smith: Well, I’ve become more interested, particularly in the last 20 years roughly as against the first 20 years, in utilising what we’ve learned about markets to do a better job of helping to design markets in new areas where people don’t have any experience, any field experience and I think the laboratory is a very useful tool for allowing people to get experience. It doesn’t provide the final experience and the final answers but the point is it is experiential and it gives people an opportunity to try out and test bed new rule systems, practitioners for example, and we found business and government, in some situations, very receptive to that. In governments, particularly in New Zealand and Australia, with respect to the liberalisation of electric power and I think we’ve seen in the California fiasco how bad things can be if you don’t think about some fundamental issues and furthermore, in that case, a lot those issues had long been studied in the laboratory and in fact influenced New Zealand and Australia but we didn’t have an opportunity to have that much influence in California. It isn’t that we didn’t communicate with any of the people that might have made a difference, it’s just that we couldn’t convince them or influence them enough. And also it turned out to be far worse than even we would have imagined as to the consequences of really not getting some elementary features of these markets right.
Daniel Kahneman: They need some help. Many years ago when we were studying failures of rationality in judgement and decision making I thought, you know, that there was a contribution to be made, for example to government decision making or to making political decisions but 25-30 years ago that was a period when the discipline of decision analysis looked extremely helpful and hopeful and it seemed as if the combination of psychology and decision analysis could be very, very useful. It has not been. I mean by and large I think this has been a failure and the reasons are quite interesting. The reasons are that the leaders do not want the help, that is the people who make decisions, important decisions, by and large do not want the kind of help that decision analysis or decision aids have to offer that we would think, you know, would certainly improve the quality of decision making. So there is a great deal of resistance and that, by itself, is quite interesting, that it’s been 30 or 40 years, you know, since decision analysis was first proposed and, by and large, very little has happened.";845;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Well Professor Kahneman, what made you decide to become a scientist?;"Daniel Kahneman: I wanted to be a philosopher actually and I decided, I became interested in psychology as a substitute for philosophy, as a way of answering questions about the human condition but answering them by looking at facts rather than by discussing words.

Vernon Smith: Well, I’ve become more interested, particularly in the last 20 years roughly as against the first 20 years, in utilising what we’ve learned about markets to do a better job of helping to design markets in new areas where people don’t have any experience, any field experience and I think the laboratory is a very useful tool for allowing people to get experience. It doesn’t provide the final experience and the final answers but the point is it is experiential and it gives people an opportunity to try out and test bed new rule systems, practitioners for example, and we found business and government, in some situations, very receptive to that. In governments, particularly in New Zealand and Australia, with respect to the liberalisation of electric power and I think we’ve seen in the California fiasco how bad things can be if you don’t think about some fundamental issues and furthermore, in that case, a lot those issues had long been studied in the laboratory and in fact influenced New Zealand and Australia but we didn’t have an opportunity to have that much influence in California. It isn’t that we didn’t communicate with any of the people that might have made a difference, it’s just that we couldn’t convince them or influence them enough. And also it turned out to be far worse than even we would have imagined as to the consequences of really not getting some elementary features of these markets right.
Daniel Kahneman: They need some help. Many years ago when we were studying failures of rationality in judgement and decision making I thought, you know, that there was a contribution to be made, for example to government decision making or to making political decisions but 25-30 years ago that was a period when the discipline of decision analysis looked extremely helpful and hopeful and it seemed as if the combination of psychology and decision analysis could be very, very useful. It has not been. I mean by and large I think this has been a failure and the reasons are quite interesting. The reasons are that the leaders do not want the help, that is the people who make decisions, important decisions, by and large do not want the kind of help that decision analysis or decision aids have to offer that we would think, you know, would certainly improve the quality of decision making. So there is a great deal of resistance and that, by itself, is quite interesting, that it’s been 30 or 40 years, you know, since decision analysis was first proposed and, by and large, very little has happened.";846;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Yes, and the first question would be how did you decide to study economics? And maybe we could start with George?;"George A. Akerlof: How decide to study economics? Well I think I always wanted to be an economist, if there was such a thing. I think I didn’t know that there were really economists until I went to college. And I knew that there was such a thing. I was always interested in economics, for a very long time. And I remember at the age of 10, I asked the following question: If one person loses their job and then they stop spending, and I was a little boy, so I decided, one father, remember this was the old days, so if one father lost his job, wouldn’t that cause that family to stop spending their money and that would cause another family, another father to lose his job and that would cause that family to stop spending.
And so I was worried that the economy would have a very bleak reaction to this. And it wasn’t until I went and took freshman economics that I learned the answer to that, which is that the family would only stop spending, let’s say, three quarter of it’s money, it would save a quarter, and so the multiplier wouldn’t be that great. So I think I had a reasonable number of such questions long before I knew that economics existed.
What about you Dr Spence?
A. Michael Spence: I was not thinking about infinite multipliers when I was 10. But I did have a father who was a PhD in commerce and finance and an intellectual man. And so I had a feeling, probably about the time I went to college, that I would try to be a scholar and teacher, but I didn’t know which field. And I picked economics at the end of my undergraduate time because it seemed to be a really nice combination of theory, including mathematical theory on one hand, and things that are quite practical that you can touch and see and feel. So I picked it and I consciously thought of it as an experiment to see if I liked it. And it worked.
Finally, Dr Stiglitz?
I love mathematics, but I decided I really wanted to work on problems of society …
Joseph E. Stiglitz: I had always been interested in economics and social problems when I had been young, maybe a little older than George, in high school. But when I went to Amherst College I studied physics and math. And then towards the end of my third year, my junior year, I decided that I was more interested in working on social problems, problems with society and using the mathematics I’d learned and combining that with my interest in history and society, to work on economic problems. And so that was really the decision. I love mathematics, but I decided I really wanted to work on problems of society.
George A. Akerlof: So I think in addition, I felt that the one thing that you could do to make people better off and able to lead self-fulfilling lives was if people have more money then they’ll have fewer constraints on their lives, and so they can make more of themselves and lead happier lives. So that was actually another reason for studying economics.";847;Motivation
What about the asymmetric information? I always wondered why things happened in the ‘60’s and early ‘70’s, why didn’t it happen earlier or why did it happen at this time?;"George A. Akerlof: I can speak for myself, I think as far as I’m concerned it was an outgrowth of the work on quality in growth theory. That in growth theory, especially Joe’s and my thesis advisor, Robert Solow, he worried and made models of different qualities of capital. So vintage capital and capital in which one could choose the capital labour before the capital was built, but not afterwards. And so that made it possible, I think, because he had figured out how to model different qualities that made it possible to make models with asymmetric information, in which the key variable was the quality of the goods. Prior to that time I think we didn’t have enough mathematical ability to deal with what happened, not only when price varied, but when quality varied, especially in some continuous way.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: I think it was in a slightly different origin in my case. I was persuaded that models that we were being taught didn’t make a lot of sense for describing lots of the problems, and that there were a number of key problems, lack of perfect competition, lack of perfect information. Work had been done on the consequences of lack of perfect competition, theories of imperfect competition like Joan Robinson and Chamberlain. And the next natural question was what to do about imperfections of information? I think the key thing was that there were some very specific questions that at least I began to address, posed when I went to Kenya about how much should they be investing in education, that lead to what is the role of education? Was education just human capital, which had been the older view? Or whether other issues of education, like credentials or providing information. I think that was critical in the development.
There had been people working on generic equilibrium models with imperfect information. In other words, bringing in information into very abstract models. But they did it in such an abstract way that the questions weren’t posed in ways that lead to interesting answers. Beginning on the other side, what was a very specific issue and you started thinking about just a simple thing, assuming that two abilities, one low ability and a high ability, how do you sort them out? How do these people who are more able convince others that they’re more able? And by taking the simplest possible problem of information and thinking about how you solve that and then building up from that, rather than the abstract and try and deduce it. I think that was the critical breakthrough and I think it’s what all three of us had in common in our work, beginning with a very concrete problem and then generalising it.
A. Michael Spence: That’s very accurate. I think in addition there may have been some very interesting work in game theory, or at the application of game theory. Once again, as Joe said, not highly mathematical, most general game theory. But a game theory that was used to deal with deterrents problems and what not. And so every time you turn around there was a question about information, where it resided, how it was communicated, who knew what and when? And very bright people like Tom Schelling, for example, had started to write about it. When I started doing this, I’ll just add this one thing, there wasn’t anything there.
There was some writing by Bill Vickrey, and he was the one who I think firstly pointed out that information is a very unusual commodity and that when Joe gives it to me, when he possesses it we both have it. And I got quite intrigued. But I was sent up a whole lot of blind alleys. There are people who sent me off to study signal processing theory, because that was what they called information theory. I learned absolutely nothing useful except what the capacity of a fibre optic cable is. So there was all that going on at the same time.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: One of the key things that came out of that earlier work is the importance of how to make inferences. It wasn’t the mathematics of how you make inferences, but the conceptual process of what are the signals, what are the things from which we make inferences about what somebody else is or what the world is like? And I think that, not at the mathematical level, but at the conceptual level of this process of making inferences is really very important I think and is a common element in all three of our work.
… the reaction from the editors, and possibly also from the referees, was this was not economics and therefore should not be accepted …
George A. Akerlof: I think one interesting aspect of this is when this work was initially done it wasn’t considered to be economics. So I submitted the market for lemons to three separate journals before it was finally accepted at a fourth. And the reaction from the editors, and possibly also from the referees, was this was not economics and therefore should not be accepted. And I think that’s because in fact its methodology was different, that this was a different way of looking at price theory.
It took some time before people saw that you could do price theory this way. And I think what was so different was that instead of arguing from the top down, from taking some general principles about how markets work and pricing systems work, instead we argued from the bottom up. So we took a look at examples of such things as insurance markets and education markets, and credit markets, and market for used cars. And then argued from the way we thought those specific examples work to how markets should look.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: We looked for general principles.
George A. Akerlof: From the particular.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: And it turned out that these general principles applied very broadly, but looking at ways in which they applied differently in different markets also gave you a lot of insight into the general principles.
A. Michael Spence: And the editors that rejected George’s paper have since been fired.";847;Creativity
What are you doing now? What kind of research are you doing now?;"Joseph E. Stiglitz: One strand of research is a continuation of the problems of economics of information. It has gone into areas such as macro-economics, organisation theory, the insights of information economics has lead to theories of corporate finance, how the firms finance themselves, that has lead it to theories of firm behaviour, the theory of the risk averse firm. That has lead in turn to macro-economic theories of how the aggregate behaviour of the economy behaves. And that in turn has lead to, as one example, monetary theories, money rather than just being, monetary theory used to focus on transactions, the role of money. But in fact most transactions today use credit. And what is credit? It’s ascertaining who is credit worthy, which is an information issue. So it’s really reformulating monetary economics on the basis of theories of asymmetric information.
There’s another line of research that I’ve been very heavily engaged in which grows out of my work at the World Bank, and that is issues of development, issues of strategies for economies and transition from communism to a market economy. Both of those have a usage of the ideas that have come out, but broaden other ideas as well. Just to give you one example, a key aspect of the doctrines in development economics was a set of ideas called the Washington consensus, which was based on the belief in market fundamentalism. That markets by themselves lead to efficient outcomes. And that’s based on a belief of markets with perfect information, that set of ideas doesn’t work very well in developed economies, but in less developed economies it’s absolutely abysmal theory. And trying to think through how markets in developing countries are affected by the lack of information, as an example, and how that affects development strategies, is one of the key issues with which I’ve been concerned.
… I think the internet actually has moved the parameters, informational structure parameters and the number of markets …
A. Michael Spence: I had this somewhat unusual career and I stopped in mid 1987, became an academic administrator so that I, in the language of venture capital, this is kind of a restart. But I think the thing that I’m going to focus on when I know that I have the time again to do research is I think the internet actually has moved the parameters, informational structure parameters and the number of markets, in ways that, and I’m not sure of this, may require us to really look at the models. So I don’t think that means throwing the whole lot that we have out, but I think it probably does mean looking again. For example, and just to take one that was mentioned briefly this afternoon, if most people post prices and they’re accessible on the internet, the search cost that George Stigler did in some interesting early work, have simply disappeared.
So the naive conclusion I guess is that, you know, there isn’t any other place to hide based on that kind of search cost. But probably the correct answer is that some smart young economists, or maybe even some older ones like us, ought to take a look at the question of whether as a matter of strategy people are going to post prices anymore. And if not, what is actually going to happen in the market? That kind of thing.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: Or we’ll come back to the kinds of issues the quality, you can’t post quality.
A. Michael Spence: No they can’t post quality.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: And that is at the heart of a lot of what our work was concerned with. And that will never be well described on the internet, or perfectly described on the internet.
George A. Akerlof: I think beyond working on asymmetric information, what I’ve sort of been doing and making a career of is thinking about what assumptions or not in economics, which would make a difference. So I think the next thing I did is I worked on what happens when prices are not made at the same time, not set at the same time, and wages are not set at the same time. That’s called staggered wages and staggered prices. Then I worked on what happened when there was some band in which people were indifferent in holding their money, so you didn’t decide to do anything about your money until you had more than some threshold level or less than some threshold, so that’s called target threshold. Then I’ve worked on bringing in anthropology and sociology into economics. Which is again the same thing, it’s sort of seeing what assumptions could be in economics, that should be there but aren’t.
So I’ve worried about what happens when there’s reciprocity, especially in the employment relationship. What’s happening when fairness is an issue? And I’m currently working on the importance, especially to the labour markets and to education, of peoples’ self-concept. I think that probably the most important decision that anyone makes in their life is who they think they are and who they want to be. And economists tend to think of price as being the most important decision that they make. I think working on the asymmetric information said that another aspect of markets was quality.
But then I think there’s this third aspect that hasn’t yet been incorporated, which is who we think we are and who we want to be. And I think that this is the root cause of poverty in developed countries. That if people think that they can do something, they think they can be anything, then in fact they will and so there will be much more social mobility than they have. And I think this is the leading cause of poverty in the United States, that there are people who just don’t see the potential and just don’t have the right self-concept.
So that’s your recent work on identity?
George A. Akerlof: That’s my recent work on identity, yes.";847;Research
To what extent have you been involved in implementing your research results?;"Joseph E. Stiglitz: I spent basically from 1993 through 2000, first as President Clinton’s chief economic adviser, then as chief economist of the World Bank. And in those jobs I had to deal with a wide range of issues, not just the ones related to my own work. But an anecdote may illustrate, when I first came into the White House, I went to a meeting in which a big issue on the agenda was health insurance, reforming the health care system in the United States. And I remember going to a meeting and just sitting in the back of the room while they were discussing, and they were talking about moral hazard and average selection as the key ideas, the key problems that had to be resolved in reforming the health insurance market. And it gave me a lot of pleasure to see how quickly some of the ideas that we had developed had gone from theoretical research into being taught at graduate schools and by this point, were just common tools that everybody, you wouldn’t begin that discussion of insurance reform without the concept of moral hazard and average selection.
So in a way they’ve become a tool kit, part of the vocabulary that everybody uses. In the East Asia crisis in the World Bank and IMF, the issue of whether the bail outs were going to cause moral hazard, ie leave the lenders to take less precaution in making good loans was a standard part of the debate. And I thought that they mismanaged that in a number of ways, but partly because the IMF had not really fully integrated some of these ideas, that for instance, with imperfect information you begin to think about bankruptcy. And you start thinking about the impact of monetary policy on the likelihood the firms are going to go into bankruptcy.  You worry … the financial system is destroying information and the flow of credit. And so the intellectual frame that I brought to the issue, some of it had been incorporated, some of it had not fully been incorporated, and some of that represented some of the reasons that there were a lot of disputes about the appropriate ways to respond to the crises.
… you have to begin with the legal structure, don’t privatise too rapidly before you do that …
One more example, the work on asymmetry of information brought home the importance of corporate governance. That managers have much more knowledge and discretion about what to do with the resources under their control in the firm. And that they can use that discretion for their own benefit and not for the benefit of the shareholders. In the United States and in Sweden and in most advance industrial countries, we’re aware of that problem and have passed legal structures to prevent the abuse. In Russia they didn’t have that legal structure. Without that legal structure, privatisation lead more to asset stripping than wealth creation. The strategy for moving from communism to a market economy that some of us were very sensitive about these issues, said you have to begin with the legal structure, don’t privatise too rapidly before you do that. And that was again something that was ignored by the people who believed in shock therapy who didn’t understand the subtleties of a market economy.  And I think that has contributed to a large extent to the failures that have occurred there over the last decade.
A. Michael Spence: The only piece that I would add is there were two ways that you could go other than jumping into policy, you know, once these theoretical ideas emerged. One was to go and see how people try to use them or might try to use them when they are actually doing things in the world, like business people making strategy decisions.
And you are a coach aren’t you?
A. Michael Spence: I guess a little bit, but mostly I was the dean of a business school. So you’ve got to watch how this got translated. And the other point I guess I would make is that there’s an empirical component to this, you know, there are theoretical structures and there are the observations that all three of us made just looking at how markets behaved that caused us to try to create the models and theories. But there’s a serious empirical side to this as well where you actually go take the theories and then go try to verify. I started out down that route and ended up taking the practical side. The thing that I was never interested in doing was, and I think Joe and I are different in this respect, I was always interested in the sort of economic science of it and was happy to have others really do the policy part. This is entirely personal, it wasn’t my driving motivation.
George A. Akerlof: I think I’ve done some policy work. I’ve worked at Brookings Institution for some time. And I think that probably in the last decade or so, especially jointly with Janet Yellen, I’ve developed a style in which institutions are very important. And one should pay a great deal of attention to the detail of how institutions look and then specifically analyse special historical cases describing the institutions in detail. So Janet Yellen and Andy Rose and Helga Hessenius and I wrote a paper on East Germany during the transition. We looked at details of the institution. We did a similar paper explaining the reason for out of wedlock births, in which we looked in great detail at the history of legislation regarding abortion and also the availability of contraception.
… when you understand the details the markets are actually much more interesting than you would otherwise think …
And so I’ve done a reasonable number of policy pieces in which we are very careful about getting the institutions right. And I think that’s in the same spirit as to the original asymmetric information. We thought that the details mattered as to how the market was going to work itself out. So issues that in used cars, in insurance and so forth. So it’s a matter of being a little bit more careful than the economics was prior to this work. You have to really understand the details and when you understand the details the markets are actually much more interesting than you would otherwise think.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: I just want to add, one of the aspects of traditional economics, this is called neoclassical economics, was that you didn’t need to look at the details. The theory was that demand and supply determined everything. It was really conceived as institution free economics. So it was not only that they didn’t look at the details the theory said, they didn’t have to. And in a sense we began for the premise that that was wrong. And as you began you saw that they did matter and in a very concrete way.
George A. Akerlof: I think that’s actually why originally when I submitted market for lemons for publication, it was said this wasn’t economics. They said if this is economics, we don’t do it. That is what one of the referee’s reports said. If we accept this for publication, what are economists going to do?
George A. Akerlof: I just want to make a plug, because there’s a wonderful book out which is codified all of this, and that of course is Joe’s wonderful text book, his elementary book on economics. And I was in China last summer and it had sold over 1 million copies in China. And it’s a great book; I actually refer to it whenever I want to look at some detailed question.";847;Research

For example, and just to take one that was mentioned briefly this afternoon, if most people post prices and they’re accessible on the internet, the search cost that George Stigler did in some interesting early work, have simply disappeared.
So the naive conclusion I guess is that, you know, there isn’t any other place to hide based on that kind of search cost. But probably the correct answer is that some smart young economists, or maybe even some older ones like us, ought to take a look at the question of whether as a matter of strategy people are going to post prices anymore. And if not, what is actually going to happen in the market? That kind of thing.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: Or we’ll come back to the kinds of issues the quality, you can’t post quality.
A. Michael Spence: No they can’t post quality.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: And that is at the heart of a lot of what our work was concerned with. And that will never be well described on the internet, or perfectly described on the internet.
George A. Akerlof: I think beyond working on asymmetric information, what I’ve sort of been doing and making a career of is thinking about what assumptions or not in economics, which would make a difference. So I think the next thing I did is I worked on what happens when prices are not made at the same time, not set at the same time, and wages are not set at the same time. That’s called staggered wages and staggered prices. Then I worked on what happened when there was some band in which people were indifferent in holding their money, so you didn’t decide to do anything about your money until you had more than some threshold level or less than some threshold, so that’s called target threshold. Then I’ve worked on bringing in anthropology and sociology into economics. Which is again the same thing, it’s sort of seeing what assumptions could be in economics, that should be there but aren’t.
So I’ve worried about what happens when there’s reciprocity, especially in the employment relationship. What’s happening when fairness is an issue? And I’m currently working on the importance, especially to the labour markets and to education, of peoples’ self-concept. I think that probably the most important decision that anyone makes in their life is who they think they are and who they want to be. And economists tend to think of price as being the most important decision that they make. I think working on the asymmetric information said that another aspect of markets was quality.
But then I think there’s this third aspect that hasn’t yet been incorporated, which is who we think we are and who we want to be. And I think that this is the root cause of poverty in developed countries. That if people think that they can do something, they think they can be anything, then in fact they will and so there will be much more social mobility than they have. And I think this is the leading cause of poverty in the United States, that there are people who just don’t see the potential and just don’t have the right self-concept.
So that’s your recent work on identity?
George A. Akerlof: That’s my recent work on identity, yes.";848;Research
To what extent have you been involved in implementing your research results?;"Joseph E. Stiglitz: I spent basically from 1993 through 2000, first as President Clinton’s chief economic adviser, then as chief economist of the World Bank. And in those jobs I had to deal with a wide range of issues, not just the ones related to my own work. But an anecdote may illustrate, when I first came into the White House, I went to a meeting in which a big issue on the agenda was health insurance, reforming the health care system in the United States. And I remember going to a meeting and just sitting in the back of the room while they were discussing, and they were talking about moral hazard and average selection as the key ideas, the key problems that had to be resolved in reforming the health insurance market. And it gave me a lot of pleasure to see how quickly some of the ideas that we had developed had gone from theoretical research into being taught at graduate schools and by this point, were just common tools that everybody, you wouldn’t begin that discussion of insurance reform without the concept of moral hazard and average selection.
So in a way they’ve become a tool kit, part of the vocabulary that everybody uses. In the East Asia crisis in the World Bank and IMF, the issue of whether the bail outs were going to cause moral hazard, ie leave the lenders to take less precaution in making good loans was a standard part of the debate. And I thought that they mismanaged that in a number of ways, but partly because the IMF had not really fully integrated some of these ideas, that for instance, with imperfect information you begin to think about bankruptcy. And you start thinking about the impact of monetary policy on the likelihood the firms are going to go into bankruptcy.  You worry … the financial system is destroying information and the flow of credit. And so the intellectual frame that I brought to the issue, some of it had been incorporated, some of it had not fully been incorporated, and some of that represented some of the reasons that there were a lot of disputes about the appropriate ways to respond to the crises.
… you have to begin with the legal structure, don’t privatise too rapidly before you do that …
One more example, the work on asymmetry of information brought home the importance of corporate governance. That managers have much more knowledge and discretion about what to do with the resources under their control in the firm. And that they can use that discretion for their own benefit and not for the benefit of the shareholders. In the United States and in Sweden and in most advance industrial countries, we’re aware of that problem and have passed legal structures to prevent the abuse. In Russia they didn’t have that legal structure. Without that legal structure, privatisation lead more to asset stripping than wealth creation. The strategy for moving from communism to a market economy that some of us were very sensitive about these issues, said you have to begin with the legal structure, don’t privatise too rapidly before you do that. And that was again something that was ignored by the people who believed in shock therapy who didn’t understand the subtleties of a market economy.  And I think that has contributed to a large extent to the failures that have occurred there over the last decade.
A. Michael Spence: The only piece that I would add is there were two ways that you could go other than jumping into policy, you know, once these theoretical ideas emerged. One was to go and see how people try to use them or might try to use them when they are actually doing things in the world, like business people making strategy decisions.
And you are a coach aren’t you?
A. Michael Spence: I guess a little bit, but mostly I was the dean of a business school. So you’ve got to watch how this got translated. And the other point I guess I would make is that there’s an empirical component to this, you know, there are theoretical structures and there are the observations that all three of us made just looking at how markets behaved that caused us to try to create the models and theories. But there’s a serious empirical side to this as well where you actually go take the theories and then go try to verify. I started out down that route and ended up taking the practical side. The thing that I was never interested in doing was, and I think Joe and I are different in this respect, I was always interested in the sort of economic science of it and was happy to have others really do the policy part. This is entirely personal, it wasn’t my driving motivation.
George A. Akerlof: I think I’ve done some policy work. I’ve worked at Brookings Institution for some time. And I think that probably in the last decade or so, especially jointly with Janet Yellen, I’ve developed a style in which institutions are very important. And one should pay a great deal of attention to the detail of how institutions look and then specifically analyse special historical cases describing the institutions in detail. So Janet Yellen and Andy Rose and Helga Hessenius and I wrote a paper on East Germany during the transition. We looked at details of the institution. We did a similar paper explaining the reason for out of wedlock births, in which we looked in great detail at the history of legislation regarding abortion and also the availability of contraception.
… when you understand the details the markets are actually much more interesting than you would otherwise think …
And so I’ve done a reasonable number of policy pieces in which we are very careful about getting the institutions right. And I think that’s in the same spirit as to the original asymmetric information. We thought that the details mattered as to how the market was going to work itself out. So issues that in used cars, in insurance and so forth. So it’s a matter of being a little bit more careful than the economics was prior to this work. You have to really understand the details and when you understand the details the markets are actually much more interesting than you would otherwise think.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: I just want to add, one of the aspects of traditional economics, this is called neoclassical economics, was that you didn’t need to look at the details. The theory was that demand and supply determined everything. It was really conceived as institution free economics. So it was not only that they didn’t look at the details the theory said, they didn’t have to. And in a sense we began for the premise that that was wrong. And as you began you saw that they did matter and in a very concrete way.
George A. Akerlof: I think that’s actually why originally when I submitted market for lemons for publication, it was said this wasn’t economics. They said if this is economics, we don’t do it. That is what one of the referee’s reports said. If we accept this for publication, what are economists going to do?
George A. Akerlof: I just want to make a plug, because there’s a wonderful book out which is codified all of this, and that of course is Joe’s wonderful text book, his elementary book on economics. And I was in China last summer and it had sold over 1 million copies in China. And it’s a great book; I actually refer to it whenever I want to look at some detailed question.";848;Research
Yes, and the first question would be how did you decide to study economics? And maybe we could start with George?;"George A. Akerlof: How decide to study economics? Well I think I always wanted to be an economist, if there was such a thing. I think I didn’t know that there were really economists until I went to college. And I knew that there was such a thing. I was always interested in economics, for a very long time. And I remember at the age of 10, I asked the following question: If one person loses their job and then they stop spending, and I was a little boy, so I decided, one father, remember this was the old days, so if one father lost his job, wouldn’t that cause that family to stop spending their money and that would cause another family, another father to lose his job and that would cause that family to stop spending.
And so I was worried that the economy would have a very bleak reaction to this. And it wasn’t until I went and took freshman economics that I learned the answer to that, which is that the family would only stop spending, let’s say, three quarter of it’s money, it would save a quarter, and so the multiplier wouldn’t be that great. So I think I had a reasonable number of such questions long before I knew that economics existed.
What about you Dr Spence?
A. Michael Spence: I was not thinking about infinite multipliers when I was 10. But I did have a father who was a PhD in commerce and finance and an intellectual man. And so I had a feeling, probably about the time I went to college, that I would try to be a scholar and teacher, but I didn’t know which field. And I picked economics at the end of my undergraduate time because it seemed to be a really nice combination of theory, including mathematical theory on one hand, and things that are quite practical that you can touch and see and feel. So I picked it and I consciously thought of it as an experiment to see if I liked it. And it worked.
Finally, Dr Stiglitz?
I love mathematics, but I decided I really wanted to work on problems of society …
Joseph E. Stiglitz: I had always been interested in economics and social problems when I had been young, maybe a little older than George, in high school. But when I went to Amherst College I studied physics and math. And then towards the end of my third year, my junior year, I decided that I was more interested in working on social problems, problems with society and using the mathematics I’d learned and combining that with my interest in history and society, to work on economic problems. And so that was really the decision. I love mathematics, but I decided I really wanted to work on problems of society.
George A. Akerlof: So I think in addition, I felt that the one thing that you could do to make people better off and able to lead self-fulfilling lives was if people have more money then they’ll have fewer constraints on their lives, and so they can make more of themselves and lead happier lives. So that was actually another reason for studying economics.";849;Motivation
What about the asymmetric information? I always wondered why things happened in the ‘60’s and early ‘70’s, why didn’t it happen earlier or why did it happen at this time?;"George A. Akerlof: I can speak for myself, I think as far as I’m concerned it was an outgrowth of the work on quality in growth theory. That in growth theory, especially Joe’s and my thesis advisor, Robert Solow, he worried and made models of different qualities of capital. So vintage capital and capital in which one could choose the capital labour before the capital was built, but not afterwards. And so that made it possible, I think, because he had figured out how to model different qualities that made it possible to make models with asymmetric information, in which the key variable was the quality of the goods. Prior to that time I think we didn’t have enough mathematical ability to deal with what happened, not only when price varied, but when quality varied, especially in some continuous way.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: I think it was in a slightly different origin in my case. I was persuaded that models that we were being taught didn’t make a lot of sense for describing lots of the problems, and that there were a number of key problems, lack of perfect competition, lack of perfect information. Work had been done on the consequences of lack of perfect competition, theories of imperfect competition like Joan Robinson and Chamberlain. And the next natural question was what to do about imperfections of information? I think the key thing was that there were some very specific questions that at least I began to address, posed when I went to Kenya about how much should they be investing in education, that lead to what is the role of education? Was education just human capital, which had been the older view? Or whether other issues of education, like credentials or providing information. I think that was critical in the development.
There had been people working on generic equilibrium models with imperfect information. In other words, bringing in information into very abstract models. But they did it in such an abstract way that the questions weren’t posed in ways that lead to interesting answers. Beginning on the other side, what was a very specific issue and you started thinking about just a simple thing, assuming that two abilities, one low ability and a high ability, how do you sort them out? How do these people who are more able convince others that they’re more able? And by taking the simplest possible problem of information and thinking about how you solve that and then building up from that, rather than the abstract and try and deduce it. I think that was the critical breakthrough and I think it’s what all three of us had in common in our work, beginning with a very concrete problem and then generalising it.
A. Michael Spence: That’s very accurate. I think in addition there may have been some very interesting work in game theory, or at the application of game theory. Once again, as Joe said, not highly mathematical, most general game theory. But a game theory that was used to deal with deterrents problems and what not. And so every time you turn around there was a question about information, where it resided, how it was communicated, who knew what and when? And very bright people like Tom Schelling, for example, had started to write about it. When I started doing this, I’ll just add this one thing, there wasn’t anything there.
There was some writing by Bill Vickrey, and he was the one who I think firstly pointed out that information is a very unusual commodity and that when Joe gives it to me, when he possesses it we both have it. And I got quite intrigued. But I was sent up a whole lot of blind alleys. There are people who sent me off to study signal processing theory, because that was what they called information theory. I learned absolutely nothing useful except what the capacity of a fibre optic cable is. So there was all that going on at the same time.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: One of the key things that came out of that earlier work is the importance of how to make inferences. It wasn’t the mathematics of how you make inferences, but the conceptual process of what are the signals, what are the things from which we make inferences about what somebody else is or what the world is like? And I think that, not at the mathematical level, but at the conceptual level of this process of making inferences is really very important I think and is a common element in all three of our work.
… the reaction from the editors, and possibly also from the referees, was this was not economics and therefore should not be accepted …
George A. Akerlof: I think one interesting aspect of this is when this work was initially done it wasn’t considered to be economics. So I submitted the market for lemons to three separate journals before it was finally accepted at a fourth. And the reaction from the editors, and possibly also from the referees, was this was not economics and therefore should not be accepted. And I think that’s because in fact its methodology was different, that this was a different way of looking at price theory.
It took some time before people saw that you could do price theory this way. And I think what was so different was that instead of arguing from the top down, from taking some general principles about how markets work and pricing systems work, instead we argued from the bottom up. So we took a look at examples of such things as insurance markets and education markets, and credit markets, and market for used cars. And then argued from the way we thought those specific examples work to how markets should look.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: We looked for general principles.
George A. Akerlof: From the particular.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: And it turned out that these general principles applied very broadly, but looking at ways in which they applied differently in different markets also gave you a lot of insight into the general principles.
A. Michael Spence: And the editors that rejected George’s paper have since been fired.";849;Creativity
What are you doing now? What kind of research are you doing now?;"Joseph E. Stiglitz: One strand of research is a continuation of the problems of economics of information. It has gone into areas such as macro-economics, organisation theory, the insights of information economics has lead to theories of corporate finance, how the firms finance themselves, that has lead it to theories of firm behaviour, the theory of the risk averse firm. That has lead in turn to macro-economic theories of how the aggregate behaviour of the economy behaves. And that in turn has lead to, as one example, monetary theories, money rather than just being, monetary theory used to focus on transactions, the role of money. But in fact most transactions today use credit. And what is credit? It’s ascertaining who is credit worthy, which is an information issue. So it’s really reformulating monetary economics on the basis of theories of asymmetric information.
There’s another line of research that I’ve been very heavily engaged in which grows out of my work at the World Bank, and that is issues of development, issues of strategies for economies and transition from communism to a market economy. Both of those have a usage of the ideas that have come out, but broaden other ideas as well. Just to give you one example, a key aspect of the doctrines in development economics was a set of ideas called the Washington consensus, which was based on the belief in market fundamentalism. That markets by themselves lead to efficient outcomes. And that’s based on a belief of markets with perfect information, that set of ideas doesn’t work very well in developed economies, but in less developed economies it’s absolutely abysmal theory. And trying to think through how markets in developing countries are affected by the lack of information, as an example, and how that affects development strategies, is one of the key issues with which I’ve been concerned.
… I think the internet actually has moved the parameters, informational structure parameters and the number of markets …
A. Michael Spence: I had this somewhat unusual career and I stopped in mid 1987, became an academic administrator so that I, in the language of venture capital, this is kind of a restart. But I think the thing that I’m going to focus on when I know that I have the time again to do research is I think the internet actually has moved the parameters, informational structure parameters and the number of markets, in ways that, and I’m not sure of this, may require us to really look at the models. So I don’t think that means throwing the whole lot that we have out, but I think it probably does mean looking again. For example, and just to take one that was mentioned briefly this afternoon, if most people post prices and they’re accessible on the internet, the search cost that George Stigler did in some interesting early work, have simply disappeared.
So the naive conclusion I guess is that, you know, there isn’t any other place to hide based on that kind of search cost. But probably the correct answer is that some smart young economists, or maybe even some older ones like us, ought to take a look at the question of whether as a matter of strategy people are going to post prices anymore. And if not, what is actually going to happen in the market? That kind of thing.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: Or we’ll come back to the kinds of issues the quality, you can’t post quality.
A. Michael Spence: No they can’t post quality.
Joseph E. Stiglitz: And that is at the heart of a lot of what our work was concerned with. And that will never be well described on the internet, or perfectly described on the internet.

My name is Bertil Holmlund. I am interviewing the two Laureates in Economic Sciences this year: Professor Daniel McFadden from University of California at the Berkley and Professor James Heckman from University of Chicago. They have received the Prize for their contributions to micro econometrics, which is a field on the boundary between economics and statistics. This interview takes place at the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm on December 13, a couple of days after the Laureates have received the Prize. I think I should like to start by asking you how it all began. How come that you started to study economics seriously? Was it more or less by accident or was it something that you had wanted to do for a long time?;"James Heckman: In my case it probably is an accident. I went to a liberal arts college and as part of my background I was majoring in mathematics and physics. But a part of the liberal arts college there’s an option to take readings courses. Working one and one or in small groups. And out of curiosity I chose a readings class in economics where the classics were taught. Allegedly the theme was economic development. but it was reading people like Marshall, Ricardo, Smith and some of the more modern people, Arthur Lewis. I had always had a deep interest in social science, history. So even when I was in high school I was debating, and in college debating, and interested in contemporary events. And I had some interest in mathematics. And I was amazed. And then probably the most single event, the important event, was in the same class. The instructor gave me a copy of Samuelson‘s Foundations which I found to be an amazingly nice synthesis of things. It was an accident.
Also a social interest?
James Heckman: Yes. I found it interesting because I could then pursue several of my interests simultaneously. I was interested in quantitative analysis, but I also thought economists were asking interesting questions.
What about you?
Daniel McFadden: Well, I came from the natural sciences, from physics. I was a graduate student in physics and found psychology very interesting, and the psychology of behaviour. I had an opportunity to enter this disciplinary programme in the behavioural sciences. And I pursued that for my PhD and got into economics pretty much by accident, because the formal modelling, the axiomatic work that I was interested in was being done primarily by two economists, John Chipman and Leo Hurwicz. So I made economics my speciality in order to work with them.
Economists typically analyse occupational choice affected by income prospects. Did your choice of occupation to some extent reflect comparisons of incomes across occupations?
Daniel McFadden: For myself personally I would say no. I expected to be a poor academician all my life. And that was my choice. Non pecuniary returns.
What about you Jim?
It was a lifestyle choice more than a choice of money …
James Heckman: I was going to say non pecuniary returns are what drove it. It was a lifestyle choice more than a choice of money. I never expected or particularly sought after financial resources and it was an accident. I always felt I earned a huge rent. I shouldn’t say that on the television, but in the sense that I enjoy very much what I do. And the occupational choice is probably driven more by the psychic than …";850;The impact of nobel on you
You have both a background in mathematics and physics and perhaps physics is often regarded as an ideal for research. Also economics. Some critics may say that perhaps at the same time economics become more and more like a branch of applied mathematics, how do you react to that criticism of economics?;"Daniel McFadden: I think it’s natural in the development of economics to quantify it. That is to say to move from general theories about how economic systems respond to numerical predictions on what will happen if you change some economic variable. And so mathematics is a natural language for developing a quantitative version of economic theory. Mathematics for its own sake sometimes may have insufficient contact with the facts because in the end a science has to be an interplay between the logical development of the theory and the reality of the facts.
What about you Jim?
James Heckman: I think the example, the contrast between physics and mathematics is a good one, because in some sense physics is driven by mathematics. Mathematics is very useful there. But it always orients itself towards data. Some sort of empirical phenomena or maybe not string theory but in the traditional physics. And in some sense I think that is a major model. It certainly was a major model for me. And I think it’s not a bad model for economics generally to think of using mathematical models but to try to explain some aspect of reality, in this case social reality rather than a physical reality.";850;Motivation
What about econometrics and its role to help us to choose between different models or theories? Ideally statistical testing should be a way of discriminating between alternative theories to weed out the weak theories. Do you think econometrics has been reasonably successful in this regard?;"Daniel McFadden: I certainly think there has been great progress in the last few decades in doing real windowing out of hypothesis about behaviour. I think you see it in the kinds of things that Jim has looked at. Job, the effectiveness of various alternatives for job training. You see it a great deal in labour market and public finance applications. And there I think econometrics has been very successful. If you ask is it successful in modifying the deeper theory of economics I think the answer is less so. That’s partly because that theory is more closely held by economists and they’re less willing to change. Perhaps also because the deepest theory of economics is often viewed as a kind of a parable for how people should behave rather than something that is predictive act by act. So when evidence appears that seems to violate one particular act people will say it’s not a failure of theory. It’s a failure of interpretation or a failure of approximation.
Jim?
James Heckman: I think econometrics has had a very large role, but I think probably one of the biggest developments, it’s been around since the beginning of econometrics. But one of the most important developments has been understanding when we can use data to sort out hypotheses. You know identification questions. And when we cannot. When essentially the matters given available data do not allow a decisive resolution of the issue. I think economists have made a lot of progress on this question in the last 20 or 30 years. So we understand that some matters can’t be settled with the available data and that stimulates the collection of new data where that might be settled.
… testing is like an event, an activity which is very useful …
I think econometrics plays a huge role in thinking through the issues very clearly. So testing is like an event, an activity which is very useful, but I think considering identification and considering what we can in principle separate from what we can’t is extremely useful and is productive in many areas. Observational equivalents is what the macro economists call it. And identification is what the micro economists call it. But it’s the same idea. Same pressures.";850;Competencies
Do you think we should have much more of replication of existing empirical studies to check how robust the results are? Replications of econometrics studies to a much more systematic extent than we have seen so far.;"James Heckman: I’m thinking in particular of a book that you may know of edited by Mary Morgan and Magnus and others, where there was an attempt to replicate Tobin‘s study of the demand for food. You know this study? No. Ed Lamar and others participated in this. And it was a little disturbing. Certainly the act of replication was very important but it seemed there were many other judgements that were brought in. And it led people, who were participating in this study of replication, to become aware of something. They started talking about the art of econometrics or the practise. The term, I’m forgetting right now, but there was a term about all the implicit assumptions, tacit econometrics I think was the term. So I think replication is extremely important precisely because in the past to any number there are a lot of other, quote enabling auxiliary assumptions.
Do you want to comment on this?
Daniel McFadden: I certainly think that economics will progress as replication becomes more important. And I would criticise the way our journals currently operate. They tend to always look for things which involve some new technique or some completely new data or some completely new idea. There’s probably insufficient value placed on good work which verifies and checks things that have been done before.";850;Role of Science
On the same topic I think of Wassily Leontief. He’s actually a former Nobel Laureate in economics and he has drawn the attention to the dominance of theory in economics journals. It seems as if the fraction of pure theory papers without any data is much higher in economics than in say physics or chemistry. Do you think that this is a problem? That it seems as if theory is given much more emphasis in economics than perhaps it is in other sciences.;"James Heckman: I would make the remark that his remark was written in 1972. And it may have been more of a problem in 1972 or 74. I think it was his presidential address for the American Economic Association. It was certainly much earlier. I think there’s been a huge growth in the last 20 years of applied economics. And empirical economics. And if anything one might criticise the other way. That there’s been a huge amount of empiricism without any theory which I think may in fact be equally harmful and possibly more harmful for reasons we talked about earlier. So I’d be less worried now than I think I would have been, or less sympathetic with that comment, than I might have been 20 years ago.
Daniel McFadden: I’ve actually encouraged that traditionally empirical econometric work is hard to present within the bounds of a journal article simply because so much background documentation is required to fully explain what you do empirically. And I think with the development of electronic journals and the possibility of referencing things in a way which is available to readers, to users. Empirical presentation of results should get better and should begin to have more sway I think because you can present the results and provide at the same time the adequate background for those who want to fill in the gaps.";850;Advice for young scientists
Empirical research requires data and good quality data and to compile data takes time. Do you think that the collection in improving data is valued as much as it should in the profession? Jim.;"James Heckman: In some quarters yes. If you could point for example study done by Truman Bewley a few years ago. Truman Bewley is a very first rate mathematical economist who suddenly developed a mid career, I wouldn’t want to call it a mid career crisis but it was certainly a mid career development, where he thought it would be very useful to interview firms about their wage setting policies. I think the profession has actually become more and more appreciative of data. I mean we’ve had large efforts across the board. Many fields. I think it’s much more common now for individuals to collect their own data and to encourage the collection of data. I think 20 or 30 years ago it used to be the case that economists and sociologists were completely opposite ends of the spectrum. That only very few economists were collecting data. And now I think there’s a very, very active group of many economists in many fields collecting their own data whether through experiments or through the secondary collection of data. So I think it’s a major activity.
Daniel McFadden: I agree with Jim. My recommendation to young people though is get tenure first and then develop large data sessions …";850;Research
There is another way of testing, at least a complimentary way, and that is experiments and economics is becoming more and more an experimental science. Do you think that this development is all for the good or are there some drawbacks here? Dan.;Daniel McFadden: I’m very enthusiastic about the opportunities that experiments offer for understanding economic behaviour. And, and for that matter understanding more about economics including the organisation of markets and alternative market forms. So I’m very encouraged. The experimentalists and the econometricians could benefit from talking more to each other because right now the experimentalists have even more than the econometricians difficulty presenting their results in a form which is as concise and informative as a theorem that the theorists can do. And so I think a great opportunity is for the possibility of using econometrics to distil and extract the essence of experimental results.;850;CPS
Jim, you have voiced some scepticism towards the use of social experiments or at least argued that these experiments have their limitations as a source of knowledge for example to evaluate the effects of programmes.;"James Heckman: Yes, and I think the kind of experiment that Dan’s talking about and the social experiment I think maybe different. And I think one has greater control of the laboratory experiment of the Vernon Smith variety for example. In the social experimental context I’ve been worried, and have written some papers on this, where I’ve seen misuse of experiments. The danger in a lot of empirical work is that sloganeering takes over. Like it’s true everywhere, I suppose. But in the context of social experiment the very name experiment seems to bring up the image of science, Bunsen burners and truth. Whereas in fact there are serious compliance problems, attrition problems, and those can substantially degrade the inference from an experiment. So that the kind of careful analysis from an experiment that has to be done at the end of the day starts to resemble very much the kind of analysis that comes from a non experimental study. It’s an additional source of variation.
I had a paper published in the May issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the May 2000 issue. Where we saw that a social experiment which I was engaged had on a naïve basis led to the notion that job training, all types of job training, were extremely poor. However when you looked at crossover and attrition problems in that study there was a major reworking of the evidence. So very simple corrections. Non-experimental corrections to the experiment caused a rethinking and I think a reshaping conclusion. So it’s a delicate tool. It’s a valuable source of information. But unfortunately in policy circles it’s viewed as somehow a panacea. You know again any slogan whether it’s multiple regression or [INAUDIBLE] or a selection bias correction, any un-critical notion econometric tool is taken out of context can be a very dangerous tool and misapply.";850;Creativity
Your works have been highly relevant for policy making. Do you see cases where your studies have had some impact on actual policy decisions? Dan.;"Daniel McFadden: I think certainly in the area of labour force participation both our works have had major impacts. The question of whether people enter the labour force or not. If they become unemployed how long they stay unemployed. I think our ability to understand the incentives that influence that and how people respond to those incentives have greatly improved.
Can you point to some specific instances? Where do you believe that your studies made a difference in terms of policy decisions?
James Heckman: I would give some examples. Just for the work in job training. Both here and in other countries has had a direct impact in the sense of advice for governments. I was actually involved in the job training partnership act experiment and non experimental study. And as a result of that study, this was a large scale manpower training programme in the US, the programme was fundamentally altered. Now unfortunately I wouldn’t say it was my particular study alone that cost the body of work. There was a group of associates. But there are specific examples. There is now an examination under way about what’s called the GED programme. Exam Certification Programmes. Partly based on this work. So I think there has been. Dan’s being modest but I would say the area of rapid transit study has had huge impact on policy and that’s a prototype for analysis of other policies";850;Career Development
This policy of economics also creates a greater demand for policy advice. Have you been personally involved in policy advice informal or formal?;"Daniel McFadden: Personally I’m rather heavily involved in research related to health outcomes and the economics of health. And economic planning particularly for the elderly. And yes, I get requested quite regularly to try to understand what the impacts are going to be of changes say for example in the healthcare delivery system and how that will influence in turn people’s behaviour both in terms of how they stay healthy and what they do and in terms of their economic planning.
What about you Jim?
James Heckman: Yes I’ve been involved even at a very micro scale. Some of my students and the Cook County Chicago area we’ve been involved in the design and analysis of very small scale job training programmes for concentrated poverty. But also national policy advice. Although I wouldn’t consider myself a policy pundit in the sense of travelling and doing this frequently, more actually in Latin America recently. In the last four or five years through a variety of circumstances I have been giving advice. But only on broad scale issues. Trying to look at education training.";850;Motivation
I would like to conclude by economics as a science with imperialistic ambitions towards the other sciences. Economics invade political science, sociology, demography and so on. Presumably economists find that natural or perhaps a good thing. What about influences in the other direction? Do you believe that we can learn something from say psychology or sociology? Dan?;"Daniel McFadden: I believe we could and we must learn a great deal about behaviour from the people who are studying the individual more as an observational unit itself. That is to say economists tend to concentrate on the outer man. The person who goes to the store and buys products. But you can understand a lot more about behaviour by looking a little bit inside. The processes by which decisions are made. And I think we have a great deal to learn. Right now from the psychologists. Perhaps eventually from the people who are closer to physiology and medicine. The operation of the brain. How perceptions are formed physiologically.
What about you Jim?
James Heckman: I think certainly in my own case I would argue in the 70s a major stimulus to my own thinking was the work of the sociologist on panel data. I think people like Paul Lazarsfeld and his students like Jim Coleman actually were way ahead of economists at one time in analysing panel data. So in the 1970s I taught at a course with Jim Coleman for several years on panel data analysis and the flow was one way for a while. I think we caught up and went ahead of the sociologists. The demographers for years have been dealing with things that are called distributions of fecundicity and mortality, frailty it’s now called. But there’s been a huge amount of stimulus the other way. At least in technical statistical tools and also questions of social science. Issues of social interactions and social processes. I think the sociologists have been ahead of economists and have been stimulating to us and political science as well. Voting theory has actually been quite a productive source of ideas for economists.";850;Motivation
My name is Bertil Holmlund. I am interviewing the two Laureates in Economic Sciences this year: Professor Daniel McFadden from University of California at the Berkley and Professor James Heckman from University of Chicago. They have received the Prize for their contributions to micro econometrics, which is a field on the boundary between economics and statistics. This interview takes place at the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm on December 13, a couple of days after the Laureates have received the Prize. I think I should like to start by asking you how it all began. How come that you started to study economics seriously? Was it more or less by accident or was it something that you had wanted to do for a long time?;"James Heckman: In my case it probably is an accident. I went to a liberal arts college and as part of my background I was majoring in mathematics and physics. But a part of the liberal arts college there’s an option to take readings courses. Working one and one or in small groups. And out of curiosity I chose a readings class in economics where the classics were taught. Allegedly the theme was economic development. but it was reading people like Marshall, Ricardo, Smith and some of the more modern people, Arthur Lewis. I had always had a deep interest in social science, history. So even when I was in high school I was debating, and in college debating, and interested in contemporary events. And I had some interest in mathematics. And I was amazed. And then probably the most single event, the important event, was in the same class. The instructor gave me a copy of Samuelson‘s Foundations which I found to be an amazingly nice synthesis of things. It was an accident.
Also a social interest?
James Heckman: Yes. I found it interesting because I could then pursue several of my interests simultaneously. I was interested in quantitative analysis, but I also thought economists were asking interesting questions.
What about you?
Daniel McFadden: Well, I came from the natural sciences, from physics. I was a graduate student in physics and found psychology very interesting, and the psychology of behaviour. I had an opportunity to enter this disciplinary programme in the behavioural sciences. And I pursued that for my PhD and got into economics pretty much by accident, because the formal modelling, the axiomatic work that I was interested in was being done primarily by two economists, John Chipman and Leo Hurwicz. So I made economics my speciality in order to work with them.
Economists typically analyse occupational choice affected by income prospects. Did your choice of occupation to some extent reflect comparisons of incomes across occupations?
Daniel McFadden: For myself personally I would say no. I expected to be a poor academician all my life. And that was my choice. Non pecuniary returns.
What about you Jim?
It was a lifestyle choice more than a choice of money …
James Heckman: I was going to say non pecuniary returns are what drove it. It was a lifestyle choice more than a choice of money. I never expected or particularly sought after financial resources and it was an accident. I always felt I earned a huge rent. I shouldn’t say that on the television, but in the sense that I enjoy very much what I do. And the occupational choice is probably driven more by the psychic than …";851;The impact of nobel on you

When did you know you wanted to pursue economic sciences?;I always knew that I wanted to be a scientist, but I didn’t know what economics was. I didn’t know what economics was until I got to college. There are many fields that you don’t know until you get to college. It’s hard to teach philosophy or religion or economics to high school students. We do a very good job teaching complicated sciences, but we don’t do a very good job teaching complicated subjects that concern interactions of societies and people and politics, and that’s what you learn when you’re in college. When I was a child, I knew I wanted to do something in science. I didn’t know a lot about science, but when I got to Bronx High School of Science, I discovered the wonders of what goes on under a microscope, and I decided that I wanted to study bacteria. When I went to college, I went to college to do bacteriology, but I didn’t, I wasn’t even informed sufficiently about what was happening in genetics and in the science of the cell. I don’t think I got the best information from people at the time, but it didn’t matter really in the long run.;803;Motivation
How did you decide to study the women’s labour market?;When I went to Cornell, I entered to do bacteriology, and then I transferred to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to pursue just about anything that I wanted to pursue. I took courses in many, many different subjects. Then when I hit upon economics, it wasn’t simply economics, it was a person, it was Alfred Kahn, who was someone who was passionate about the field of economics and explained it to me in a way that I could understand and truly appreciate as being a subject in which there were a multiplicity of forces that also brought you eventually back to an equilibrium. It was a subject that was highly mathematical that appealed to me. His field happened to be industrial organisation and the theory of regulation. When I was in college, most of the economics that I studied was in fields that I do not pursue now, although I think of myself as a very generalist economist, because as an economic historian I have to be open to just about any type of economics that will work and fit and be relevant to the subject and the period that I’m studying. But when I was in college, in fact, I was working in the field of industrial organisation, which is the theory of product markets, and when I went to graduate school, I went to the University of Chicago, because that’s where some of the great minds in industrial organisation and in law and economics were.;803;Advice for female scientists
Did you have a mentor who influenced your career?;The role models and mentors that I have had, have all been individuals who have been passionate about their subject. Beginning, as I said, with Alfred Kahan, who is known as Fred Kahan, he was passionate about regulation. In fact, he served as the head of the Civil Aeronautics Board in America, and he deregulated the airlines, and that was effectively getting rid of the Civil Aeronautics board, so probably in the history of heads of agencies, he may be one of a very few number of people who actually dissolved the agency that he was the head of. That deregulated the airline prices and brought down airline prices in America, and led to the formation of many airlines that we no longer have, but that were very small airlines such as People’s airlines. When I went to Chicago I was fortunate enough to have a large number of extraordinary mentors and people who mentored because they were passionate about their subjects. Gary Becker, for example, was one of the individuals. Robert Fogel was another one of the individuals. These are the people who in some sense guided me more and more towards away from industrial organisation towards labour economics and towards economic history. Although I must say that they would not have been unhappy if I studied industrial organisation as well.;803;Mentors (Role models)
How do you maintain your focus and motivation?;I don’t think that I could survive without such a curiosity. We just had a wonderful lunch in which we started talking about the history of cooking and the history of food, and why it is that certain countries have hard bread and certain countries have softer bread, and what is it about the mill of wheat and the use of water power versus wind power? That was just a lunch. I started thinking about other issues in culinary history. I don’t necessarily do culinary history, but in some sense, we all do culinary history. It’s simply a questioning about every single thing that we do, and we think about. The beauty of being an academic is that we can pursue any part of it. The beauty of having wonderful students, as I have, and I have had for all the years I’ve been teaching, is that I can mention these to my students and have conversations, and maybe they will pursue it as one of the essays that they will write, or maybe even a book one day. I do have a student right now who’s working on certain aspects of culinary history.;803;Creativity
Where does your curiosity come from?;I don’t want to say I was born with it, because that will be discouraging to certain people who will say, was I born with it. I think that it’s something that you feel as you are walking around our complicated world, a listening to news, thinking about people who don’t know and their travails or their happinesses that you want to know more about them. You want to know more about their history, you want to know more about their countries, you want to know more about the history of that, and this adds and becomes much, much larger.;803;Motivation
How did you celebrate the news of your prize?;It was celebrated by … I remember we went to a press conference at Harvard. My husband, Larry, one of our students, Dev, came over that morning and our dog Pika, and we all walked to 1 Brattle Street to the press conference. All of us went to the press conference. Then we walked from the press conference up to Littauer where our offices are, and we walked up the steps, and I was greeted by, oh, I don’t know, 150 students and faculty. It was a beautiful day. It was a gorgeous day. It was October 9th, and the sun was shining, and the sky was as blue as it could be over the gorgeous buildings at Harvard and the steeples. It was a lovely celebration of being with students and faculty. Of course, it was saddened by the war in which at the time wasn’t necessarily a war, but the capture of hostages of Israelis, that really saddened it terribly, so it was a bit of a mixture. I tried to feel a celebration, but I also felt a certain amount of pain.;803;The impact of nobel on you
What was your first reaction to the news?;That’s going to be my little two minute. My first reaction was that I had to do something very quickly. We had an hour and a half to get up and get ready for the announcement, so it meant that we had to take the dog out and we had to make a little breakfast, and we had to take showers. I had to think hard about a long part of my life’s work and write something up, and think about what I would say and all the people I would want to thank. I sat down and we did all of that, then I sat down, and six o’clock came and I realised that something that I hadn’t thought would happen is that emails just started piling up in my only account. It’s not as if I had a private account and a public account. I knew that I had to work through these emails to find the ones that I needed, for example, from the Nobel Foundation, from close relatives, from close friends. Then I realised that it wasn’t a hundred emails, in a very, very short period it became almost a thousand. We went to the press conference and then came back and I started reading them thinking, how am I going to work through all of these? I needed something special, some superpowers. As I was reading them, I realised that many of them started out with the phrase “I cried”. It started out with, “I am so joyful”. These were statements of people, of course, I didn’t know, who felt that I had made their work validated, I had uplifted them. I gave them pride in who they were. Through these many joyful and jubilant emails, I found the strength that I needed to read all the rest. For me, it was an award that was clearly given to me, but I felt that it had been magnified thousands of times over by what I was hearing in these emails.;803;Impact of the Nobel on you
How important is collaboration in science?;It’s a very interesting question and would have to be answered on many levels. On one level, there’s been collaboration in many types of science. We can hear our friends in chemistry and physics particularly in the biological sciences, or thinking about the Higgs boson, for example, which was a collaboration of hundreds and hundreds of people where we have science that is made up of so many multiple things that are needed. Economics had been different. It had been the way science was once done where a person, one person, would strike out and do something themselves. I think, for example Bob Fogel and, and Gary Becker that we were just talking about. Economics now is far more collaborative. It’s rare. It’s rare that someone will write an article by themselves or write a book by themselves. I have done a bit of that, but I also work collaboratively. When I first began working collaboratively, there were very few women to work with, so most of my early collaborations are with men, and one with someone who is brilliant and insightful and also my husband, and that’s Larry Katz. I love working with Larry Katz, but now I also work with women, Claudia Olivetti, who will be coming tomorrow or the next day. So I have finally been able to work with women. I wrote an important paper with Cecilia Rouse, for example. It’s wonderful working with smart, intelligent, collaborative people, but working with women is also adds another element.;803;Creativity
Tell us about the dogs in your life.;I will say, I have never brought a dog into an archive. Even though the dog looks like in the graphic, it’s in the archive, the dog has never been in the archive. When I grew up, I had no pets. I lived in the Bronx in New York, and I didn’t know anything about dogs. My first dog was when I was in graduate school, so that’s pretty late for most people. She was a phenomenal animal, her name was Kelso, but I didn’t have that much time to do very serious training with her. I’ve really only had three dogs. Thank goodness, two of them have lasted a very long time. Pika is 13 now, and I hope he will be with us for a couple more years. I started doing a competitive work with dogs, and Pika happens to be an incredible centre, meaning he … Whenever I say centre, it sounds like it’s a football player. I love training the dog. I love getting to know the dog, getting deep into the mind of something that we really do not understand, of course. But in addition, the dog is companionship, and finally it brings me to another group of people, my dog friends, the people I train with, the people I track with, the people I go scenting with, the people I train with in terms of obedience. Just like any sport, it brings you to a different wonderful group of people.;803;Life
What advice would you share with young scientists?;It’s very simple. Follow your passions. If you’ve gotten involved in this subject, there are questions that you have, and those are going to be your passions. Just keep on following them. Don’t think that you will easily find an answer, that sometimes going about and looking for description, understanding what happened, understanding its history, understanding how it impacted people. Even talking to people can help you a lot. Our students today are obsessed with finding the best causal identification. That’s sometimes difficult. It may be the gold standard, it may be exactly what we want, but it may not be always be attainable right then and there, and it may be that you’re asking the wrong question until you observe. But if you keep the passion, if you keep the passion to answer the question you’ll do very well.;803;Advice for young scientists
What’s the best way to overcome obstacles?;You just keep on going. I mean, some of the biggest failures I have had are funny stories, they become really funny. The biggest failures are when I thought I was after some important set of documents, and I found that I couldn’t get the documents, but sometimes it’s taken me to a place on Staten Island, which was supposed to have a set of documents from Citibank. It was one of these Ironman facilities that in which Citibank gives over its information every day to this place. They card it away, and they put it in boxes, and eventually they destroyed what’s in some of the boxes, but some of the boxes are supposed to be kept indefinitely. I was after those types of boxes, and not to get into the immense amount of difficulty I had, but I was coming with a letter from the CEO of Citibank to this Ironman facility, and I walk in with this letter and the person looks at me like, I have no idea what you’re here for. I’m looking up at the largest amount of boxes I have ever seen. It was something from some movie about hell on earth, just gigantic amounts of boxes. We checked through many of them. For this person to pull the boxes, the person actually had to be on a cherry picker. That’s how many boxes there were and the potential difficulties of getting them down. No, I never found what I was after and wasted several days, but that’s what happens.;803;Creativity
Did you feel alone as a pioneering woman in your field?;I don’t think I’ve ever felt alone because one always has other friends, other women friends. In part one feels alone because there are moments when you feel that there are clubs and that you’re not necessarily a part of the club. But I don’t think that I felt terribly much alone, and maybe that’s because going to Bronx High School of Science – science was as an institution at the time – was disproportionately male, so I didn’t feel very much alone.;803;Advice for female scientists
Do you have advice for young women in economic sciences?;Just like when I was a graduate student, and all of the fields were mainly male fields. Today, it is the case in economics that some of the sub-disciplines are more made up of more women than others. It would be very nice if more women became macro economists and econometricians, because we need you there.;803;Advice for female scientists
Why is diversity important in economic sciences?;"There are two aspects of this. One is, why don’t we get diversity? and the other one, what is the role of diversity? I have dealt a lot with the first one, I can say a little bit about the second. Men and women often look at disciplines like economics slightly differently, and occasionally they’re both wrong. In my work on undergraduate women in economics and trying to figure out why economics isn’t doing as great a job as many other disciplines, despite the fact that women are just as good at math as men, and economics is a very math intensive subject, more than the biological sciences, for example, possibly more than chemistry is, not necessarily more than physics is. I thought about – this was several years ago – why it is, and realised that many individuals are making this decision before they even go to college. Many of the reasons why they’re making these decisions is what gets discussed at the breakfast table with their parents and what they read in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post or whatever, newspaper or social media they’re reading. Economics to many people looks like finance, but it’s not finance. Finance may be a part of economics, but economics is not finance.
Many of the young men, when they go to college and they’re asked before they go to college in the summer, what would you like to major in? Give me three subjects, and they’ll put economics down as one, and you’ll ask them why. They’ll say, because economics is finance and I want to go into finance. If you ask the women, why didn’t you put down economics? they’ll say, because economics is finance and I don’t want to go into finance. Both of them are wrong. They should both go into economics because of what economics is and not what economics is not. That’s part of the issue that diversity is important because men and women, or individuals of different ethnicities or races, may somehow believe that they want to get something out of a field. It’s very difficult to know what the field is until you take it, until you have appropriate exposure to it. Because some fields, as I said before, are not taught in high school or they’re not taught well enough in high school. Even the fields that are taught in high school, like history, may not be taught the way they’ll be taught in your college, but some fields simply aren’t taught. That’s one reason why we should want to have more diversity maybe related to why we don’t have enough diversity.
But the other reason is what do we get from diversity? This is much larger a subject. Within economics, it’s very clear that what we get from diversity is not simply having different views across the board, but the fact that women and men are tending to go into different parts of economics. If economics is 10 or 12 subfields, women are tending to go into one set of subfields and men are tending to go into another set of subfields. Therefore, all these years not having enough women means that those subfields were populated by a much smaller group of individuals, and one of them happens to be help.";803;Diversity in sicence
How do you try to encourage diversity in economic sciences?;Oh, absolutely. I devised with a group of people this undergraduate in economics, let’s call it a program. We came up with a large number of ways so that economics is seen as what it is. Economics is about people, and it’s about various aspects of people’s relationship to each other and to markets and to the world of economics. We devised it so that when freshmen or first year students too come in the door of universities and economics departments are able to give them information that demonstrate to them what economics is about and what economists do, that economists really do work with people. They work on inequality, they work on health, they work on economic development and so on. There are various ways of doing this so that it is not believed by first year students that within the social sciences, psychology deals with people and economics deals with just markets or money or stock markets and so on – that economics is about people. If undergraduates realise that economics … I mean saying economics is not about people to me as a joke, but that’s what many, many people think, that economics is not about people, and if they do believe this, it’s our failure not to tell them that that isn’t true.;803;Diversity in sicence
How would you describe a good teacher?;One of the problems that we face in economics is that we create our subject as a set of courses that begins with economic theory. Economic theory then is pushing students away from the notion that economics is about people, because economics then becomes about a set of abstract ideas. In the sciences, in physics, for example, it would be more accepted that physics is about abstract ideas, but economics really isn’t about abstract ideas. Yet we’re teaching them that economics is about these abstract markets. But a talented teacher should be able to blend the two. I would describe a good teacher as having an idea, a subject that you want to convey, and conveying it in a way that you could see in the eyes of a student is making them surprised and interested and inspired. If you can’t do that, you haven’t reached the individual.;803;Mentors (Role models)
You named a recent article “Why women won”. Why did you choose that title?;First of all, the title “Why Women Won”. The article is a beginning exploration of mine. A gift that we academics have is that when we have a question and we have some time, we can sort of go about trying to answer it. My question was, I know where women are today and I know where they once were, how did they get to today? That’s sort of why women won. That does not mean that women have won exactly what they should win, or that along the way all women won what they should have gotten. But it is a statement that where we are today is very, very different from where we were in my own lifetime, not when I was born, not even when I was in college, but when I was in graduate school, and even when I was an assistant professor at Princeton. What women have today in terms of their legal rights is phenomenally greater. What their legal rights are in the workplace, what their legal rights are in the credit market, what their rights are with regards to their family, with regard to their name, with regard to their body, with regard to contraception – and the list goes on. What women’s rights are in America as well as in many parts in the world, are much, much greater. That does not mean that these rights are rights that they always have. That does not mean that these rights are the rights that they can easily begin to take advantage of, but that these are their rights.;803;Advice for female scientists

You received the 2021 prize in economic sciences for your “empirical contributions to labour economics.” What was your first real job?;If you grow up on a farm, you’re working when you’re eight or nine years old. You help out a little bit and then as you get older and learn to drive the tractors and have a little more independence. I had many of those kind of jobs. The first of the farm jobs I had, I would’ve been working for other farmers. Then eventually there was a local university near where I grew up and they had a huge research farm where they grew crops to try out and things like that. So I had a job there for a few summers.;807;Career Development
Was there a single defining moment when you decided to pursue economic sciences?;Maybe in my senior year, my final year of college. At that time, at the university that I went to, economics used to be a much smaller subject than it is now. So even though there was a fairly large number of faculty, there were relatively few students. We had very ideal conditions. We had lots of faculty, and there was a small course where we learned how to write papers. I did my senior thesis on strike activity, at that time – in the 1970s – there were a lot of strikes in Canada and the United States, and I got interested in that topic. I found it interesting and we were using computers, which was somewhat more cumbersome than it is now. You had to type your programs on cardboard cards and then they would be read by the computer. There were a lot of other students working at the same time, some of whom I’m still friends with. There’s a certain amount of comradery doing that research. Then I decided maybe I would go to graduate school.;807;Motivation
How would you say that we can encourage more diversity in the field of economic sciences?;"Somehow, I would say in the last 10 years, at least in the United States, things have really changed. You can see that really all over the place. I’ve done some research on what kind of distinguished faculty receive special awards and the fraction of the awards that are going to women in economics and in other fields has really shot up. Having female scholars being recognised and shown as role models might have a positive influence.
A very long time ago in 1960s and 70s, there was definitely discrimination against female scholars. You can see examples of people who were passed over for these kind things. Things have really changed very much in the graduate education, so right now I think most of the top programs are virtually 50/50, so they are really reaching out and pushing hard to make sure that they stay close to 50/50, whereas even five years ago, that just wasn’t as much of a concern. So that has really come to the fore for reasons I’m not entirely sure of.
On the issue of minorities, that is an even worse problem. Graduating with a PhD in economics every year in the United States, there’s probably only four or five African Americans, a really low number. That’s caused by a number of factors, including real shortfall of people graduating from high quality universities in economics that are African American. So we’re not doing a very good job of keeping kids, especially highly talented minority kids, in economics and getting them through the bachelor’s program and then going onto a PhD. Now, on the other hand, it’s not entirely clear that going to do a PhD is the right thing if you’re that person, there’s a lot of other opportunities. For instance, going to law school might be pretty important for really talented minorities. We really need some of those people in the law profession. In the United States, everything is really run by lawyers. If you don’t have representation in the bar, you’re really in trouble and it’s going to change the way things go and we see that happening now, to some extent. So I think that that might be actually more of an emergency there than in economics.";807;Diversity in sicence
What kind of qualities do you need as a person, if you want to be a successful scientist or researcher within the field of economic sciences?;Our profession, economics in particular, is very front loaded. It’s a little different than the hard sciences. So when people graduate with a PhD, they will have done a very original piece of research at that point. It’s not like they will have been engaged in a lab and helped their lab director and PhD advisor. They will have had to come up with their own independent research. There’s a huge amount of pressure on students to do that, which I’m not entirely sure that’s the right system, but that’s the system we have. There’s just an enormous amount of pressure and that pressure maintains until someone gets tenure. So that’s about eight, nine years of intense pressure coming at the end of the age 25 to 35. I think that basically people who can deal with a lot of pressure and put in enormously long hours, unfortunately that’s what’s required at that exact time. You can see right away, that’s a disadvantage for females because it means it’s going to cut right into time when they might reasonably think about starting a family.;807;Competencies
Would you say that creativity, persistence and coping with failures are important traits for becoming successful in science?;All of those things, for sure. The hardest one of those is coping with failure, that’s difficult because most of these people with flawless resumes haven’t really had any failures yet. So that’s a little difficult. They’re going to probably be 25 to 28 years old by the time they have their first failure, which is when they don’t get a really good job from the PhD program. That can be a really difficult problem that some of the students are not equipped to deal with. Because they haven’t had any of that kind of failure before. Persistence – that kind of goes without saying, I think. It’s a high commitment field. Most people who are doing economics who are going to be very successful are pretty nerdy and working 12 to 15 hours a day, seven days a week with a few breaks here and there.;807;Competencies
How have you yourself coped with failures in your life?;Well actually I probably haven’t had any huge monumental failures. A lot of times the most standard problem that you have is that you work on a project you think that it’s really interesting and that the results are important and then other people don’t really care for it. I think the best antidote for that kind of problem is that, you know, there’s a new idea. So people are always looking for the new idea and thinking about, this is a really exciting project. And hopefully this one will really get people excited.;807;Creativity

Can you tell me a bit more about what you like to do in your spare time?;I have a woodworking job and I make furniture once in a while, but the last couple of years, I haven’t really had much time. To tell you the truth, the Nobel Prize thing is kind of time consuming so I’ve kind of let that slide a little bit. But yeah, that’s something I enjoy doing, biking. I ride my bicycle to school, but that’s because there isn’t any parking on campus. Now I supposedly have a parking place from the university, but even then it’s faster to ride your bike than to drive your car.;807;Life
Your co-laureate Guido Imbens, you have known for a long time, haven’t you?;I can tell a pretty good story. I’d come to Berkeley and I was sitting in my office and he gave me a call. I mean, I knew him reasonably well. He gave me a call and said, “David, I’m going to get married to Susan and she’s got a job at Stanford. I need a job at Berkeley.” Cause he was at UCLA at the time. So I said, “Okay, I’ll see what we can do.” It turned out to be really good because he was a great addition to the faculty at Berkeley and really made a huge positive impact. Unfortunately, he and Susan got a job offer to go to Harvard and they went but then they came back to Stanford.;807;Creativity
How did you react when you heard the news about your prize? You came home very early in the morning and you just landed from a flight?;I had just flown back from Canada visiting my mother. I drove from the airport to our house in Sonoma County, which is a little bit outside of San Francisco area. I got there about one o’clock, our time in the morning and was having a shower. My wife said, “Well, I just got a signal on my cell phone that there’s a message on her home answering machine.” And then she played the thing and it said, well, you know, they’re calling from Sweden. Then we thought that it was actually my friend from Canada playing a joke. Then we figured out that it was actually a real Swedish phone number.;807;The impact of nobel on you
Can you tell us a little bit about your childhood?;I was born in Columbus, Ohio and I grew up in Pittsburgh. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was three. My parents were academics. They got their PhDs from Ohio State and my dad had also been stationed in the air force and an air force base near Columbus, Ohio, where I was born. My parents got their first jobs in Pittsburgh, so we moved to there and eventually they both left academia, but they never left Pittsburgh. That’s where I grew up, went to elementary school, middle school, high school.;808;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
We understand you weren’t particularly academic as a youth?;Yeah, I wasn’t a very good student and actually my parents didn’t like being professors very much so they both quit that. So maybe it’s a little ironic that I ended up being a professor. I got in some trouble for various reasons in school and I didn’t really get engaged with high school at all. After maybe ninth grade, I didn’t take any of the accelerated college courses and I just wanted to finish as quickly as possible. So I managed to finish high school in 11th grade by meeting all the state requirements for diploma. I took two English classes, two health classes – that was sex education, badly done – and, two gym classes, physical education classes. And I was able to get my diploma and leave high school. I worked for a little bit more than a year and then I decided probably I should go to college.;808;Life
Why were you so keen to leave school and start working?;Well, I hadn’t found anything that interested me in school. There were things that interested me. I had a lot of hobbies. I had a photographic dark room – this was before digital photography – in my basement where I developed my own film. I enjoyed print shop in high school and we made t-shirts out of rock albums covers and that sort of thing. I had various other hobbies but nothing in school really engaged me. I liked working partly because I thought working was fun, but partly also I wanted to have money. Once I was 16 I bought my neighbour’s car. So I had this awesome powerful car, but it was high maintenance and had terrible gas mileage. It got six miles to the gallon, so I always needed money to pay for gas, repairs, and insurance. I had started working anyway – I had my first job when I was 13, I think I worked in a restaurant as a bus boy. Then later I got interested in working with people with mental disabilities and I worked at camps. So that’s what I went to do.;808;Life
So where does your passion for economic sciences come from? Was there a particular person that influenced you?;I think, like many people, I got excited about my field through an inspired and inspiring teacher. When I arrived at Oberlin College in Ohio, I didn’t know what I wanted to study. I thought maybe I would continue in the special education field so I took psychology. But already in my household we talked about economics, my father in particular was interested in economics, even though he was an engineer. I had some sort of dinner table background so I took Econ 101 and I really liked that a lot. I had a wonderful teacher named Bob Piron and I thought his class was so much fun. I liked the material. I also liked the way he taught. It was sort of a high-pressure classroom. Later I adopted that style. I think that’s going out of style now, but it was lots of cold calling and a very challenging dynamic classroom atmosphere. It wasn’t relaxing, but he was also a very funny guy. I enjoyed it a lot and I connected with the material I saw. I had some affinity for it. It wasn’t that it was easy, but I was willing to spend the time on it. So I took a lot of economics and I liked almost all of it.;808;Motivation
Your prize in economic sciences lecture was very engaging. How important is it to communicate about your work?;It’s very important. I like doing research, but I also love teaching and a good teacher is an evangelist for their field. Particularly when you’re teaching undergraduates, you have the opportunity to change somebody’s direction by convincing them or showing them that economics is really fascinating and rewarding. I think about my own experience in this case, even though I don’t want to learn too much from it, as I said, but I had charismatic teachers and they affected my direction and I think maybe I can have that effect on my students. That’s what I aspire to.;808;The impact of nobel on you
What qualities do you think you need to become a successful research scientist or economist?;"If you want to be a successful research scientist, you have to really love what you’re doing. You have to find it interesting. You can’t just be going through the motions. When people come to talk to me about graduate school, I caution them that it shouldn’t be a momentum play – meaning that you’ve been a good student all your life, you’re bright, you did well in college and so you figure you should be go to graduate school. I think that’s not a very good scenario for success because graduate school is really not more of the same. There’s a different quality to it. You have to be very self-motivated and you have to be able to set your own goals and push yourself to meet them. Nobody’s waking you up in the morning and saying this is what the team has to do today. There are moments like that, but it’s mostly not like that. And so if you don’t love it, you’re not going to get it done.
That would be the first thing. And then you have to have some affinity for it. You have to have the right skills, the right mindset within economics. I suspect within other fields there’s more theoretical and more empirical type of people. Even the prize I share, there’s two parts. One is for David Card and his empirical work. He was actually one of my thesis advisors. I share [the other half] with Guido Imbens for methodological work, but I’m an empiricist at heart.";808;Competencies
You are good friends with your co-laureate Guido Imbens, and were even best man at his wedding. Can you tell us a little about your friendship?;We’ve been friends since our academic childhood. I got my PhD in 1989, and I went to Harvard for my first job. I was only there for two years, but luckily Guido came in my second year and we were also neighbours. And, you know, I wasn’t very excited when we hired him. I thought his thesis was kind of boring. It was very dry and technical, but we soon hit it off and became friends and we saw a lot of each other. We started talking about these kind of applied problems that I was interested in, like using the draft lottery to estimate the effects of military service, and then some subsequent work I had done with Alan Krueger using season of birth to estimate the economic returns of schooling and Guido and I started saying, well, what could we say formally about what you’re actually learning when you do that?;808;Creativity
Do you think friendship’s important in work and collaboration?;It can be, but it’s not essential. I think it’s more fun to work with your friends. I tell my students that you want to pick your collaborators as carefully and thoughtfully as you pick your spouse. If it goes badly it can be very painful and hard to unwind. Certainly, when you’re friends with the people you work with, you worry less about that. Academia is very competitive and the stakes are seen as very high for the participants. Society maybe doesn’t care too much who wrote which paper or who gets credit for which idea, but we care. That can be a source of great tension. So you need to trust your collaborators and you trust your friends. Not everybody I’ve worked with is a close friend. I don’t think that’s essential, but it’s definitely more fun.;808;Creativity
Talking about advice to students, is there one piece of advice that you would give to a young person interested in research?;I talk to a lot of people who want to have careers in research, and I try to give them a clear picture of the life of a scholar. Some of it’s fun, a lot of it’s a drag – every job has its good parts and bad parts. We serve on committees and sometimes we disagree within the department and those can be unpleasant situations, a little bit like a family quarrel that can be very tiring. So you have to be very motivated. You really have to believe that if you want to have a career in research. I always say, who’s your role model? What’s the scholar you want to be, what sort of work you want to do, tell me some paper you wish you’d written. I try to get them to think about it very concretely, not as an abstract. And if they’re excited about that career, I think that bodes well.;808;Advice for young scientists
It sounds like you are very passionate about your research – what do you enjoy doing outside of work?;I like my work a lot and I’m sort of obsessed by it, so I never stop thinking about it, but I do have some hobbies still. I’m a cyclist. I ride every weekend. Sometimes I go mountain biking or road biking. That’s my main hobby. I ski a little in the winter and now I have a new hobby, which is even more rewarding – that’s grandchildren. My family is very important to me and the highlight of the week is definitely seeing the grandchildren.;808;Free time
Can you tell us about your childhood and how you became interested in economic sciences?;"I was born in a small town in the south of the Netherlands, Geldrop. The nearest big town was Eindhoven, which in those days was a company town. The Phillips electronics company had their headquarters there and employed a large fraction of the population there. So both my parents worked there for a while. My father worked there his entire career. When I was about six we moved to Eindhoven and then later to another small town about 20 miles east of there called Deurne, which is where I went to high school.
Neither of my parents had completed a university degree. My father had spent one year at university, but then he started working. This was in the fifties when Holland was still rebuilding after the war and studying wasn’t quite as common as it became later. But they were both very intellectually oriented and they stimulated that in us. So both my siblings and I ended up going to university. In fact, my brother got a PhD in mathematics. That was something that was very much stimulated, not in the sense of putting a lot of pressure on us, but they were very interested in us going to university and pursuing intellectual endeavours.
In my teens, I played a lot of chess which in some sense, was actually very useful in learning how to focus on problems for a long time. I still find that a very enjoyable thing, sitting in my office and not doing email, not talking on the telephone, just struggling with theoretical problems and trying to figure them out, trying to think very deeply about the problem. It’s hard to find the time to do that for long stretches of time, but that’s something I enjoy very much and I still try to find time to do that. From my perspective, that really goes back to those days.";809;Motivation
Do you see a lot of parallels between chess and what you’re working with now in your research?;Yes. At some level, I see a lot of what I do as trying to solve puzzles, trying to come up with theoretical questions and trying to solve them. And the ability to sink deep into a problem is really the key thing, and where chess I think is very helpful.;809;Creativity
Do you still play chess now?;Not very often. One of my kids got interested in it during the pandemic. So for a while we would play a lot. Actually we started playing this 24 game match, which we were almost done with, but then we postponed for a while because he was doing other things. But at the beginning, clearly I was still better, but by the end he’s clearly a better chess player than me.;809;Life
We hear you enjoy biking too. How important is free time to you?;"I think for everybody these days it’s very hard to get away from all the electronics and all the constant stream of information with social media, with email, with lots of things. So biking is just a very good way to get away from that because you’re not doing email, you’re not doing any social media, you’re not working on the computer. It’s a great time to think and to unwind. So certainly one of the things I do while biking or running or walking is thinking through problems I’m working on, but it forces me to do it at a more abstract level because obviously I don’t have a computer, I don’t have pen and paper, but I can just mull over problems and keep turning them over and think about fruitful directions.
It’s a very relaxing activity for me. I do both road biking and mountain biking, but I don’t do very complicated stuff. So I don’t need to really focus on the biking itself. It’s much more of a relaxing thing where I can think about questions. Having the physical activity and the freedom to think at the same time, I just find very relaxing and productive.";809;Life
Can you tell us what you like most about your work?;It’s probably two things. It’s talking with the students and seeing them grow as researchers, and being able to influence them and seeing them kind of develop their own ideas. And just sitting in my office, working on problems and feeling I’m making progress. The thrill of feeling I’ve learned something that I didn’t know before – more than the actual process of getting things published, but the point where I feel like, yes, I know something now that I didn’t know before and that I think is useful.;809;Research
What advice would you give to a student or young researcher?;Looking more narrowly at my students who are working in econometrics, I try to encourage them to really spend a lot of time talking to people doing empirical work and people doing more applied economics rather than getting their inspiration from reading journals. I really try to get them to focus on problems that are more directly useful for people actually analysing data and collecting the data. Over my career, I’ve really benefited a lot from collaborating closely with people like that. I see econometrics at some level, as a service field, we’re trying to help economists do better data analysis, do better empirical work and so to do that, you need to talk to the people who are actually doing the empirical work.;809;Advice for young scientists
We understand that you are close friends with your collaborator and co-laureate Joshua Angrist – and that he was even the best man at your wedding. Do you think it’s important to become friends with your collaborators?;"Yes, totally. I would find it very hard to write papers with people that I’m not friends with, that I don’t like to spend time with. I can’t be very close friends with all of them, but writing a paper is a vulnerable process. You share ideas, some of them are not going to work out, some of them are not good ideas, you make mistakes, so you need to have a fair amount of trust and a level of comfort with people to work with them.
Nowadays we can do a lot over the internet, but I would still find it very hard to start working with people if all I’d done is meet them over the internet. I do want to spend some time with them. I want to have coffee with them. I want to talk to them. I want to understand how they think about problems, how they work because it helps me interpret what they do in the course of these collaborations, how they like to write papers, how they think about having speculative ideas, whether they’re defensive about making mistakes, how they’ll respond if I make mistakes. Research is very difficult and when you’re doing this together, you need to have a fair amount of trust to be able to do good work.";809;Creativity
It must have been really special to be awarded the prize with your best friend.;Yes, that was very special. That was my first question when they called me on October 11th – who I was going to be sharing it with. It was just very exciting to hear that I was getting it getting it with Josh. David Card‘s a very good friend of mine as well, I was his colleague at Berkeley, but Josh has really been my best friend in the profession since very early on. So that was really very special.;809;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How have you found the time since your prize was awarded?;It’s been fun. It’s been a little strange with almost all of it being over zoom, but it’s been a lot of fun. It’s been particularly interesting to see the reaction in the Netherlands where they were very excited about it. One of the things that I find very nice is, unlike the Olympics where you always see these rankings, like the US has ten medals, Sweden has five, England has seven, here it seems much less exclusionary. So my high school is very excited. They claim me as one of them. The university I went to in the Netherlands is excited, the graduate school I went to in the US is very excited, UCLA where I was on the faculty was very excited – everybody shares it rather than it being very exclusionary.;809;Impact of Nobel prize on you
We saw a sweet video of you and your children after the news was announced – where they were explaining your research in their own words. How was it to share that moment with them?;Obviously from my perspective that was just one of the absolute highlights. The kids were obviously very excited, but that was just incredibly nice to see, incredibly rewarding. In that sense it was so nice to get the prize this year, despite the pandemic, but having all three of the kids there. The oldest is a high school senior so he’s going to go off to college next year, but having all three of them there was just really special.;809;Family/Home Environment
How did you find out you’d been awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences?;Even though I knew it was the night of the prize announcement, even though people had been talking to me about it, I said, ‘I’m just going to do what I always do every night.’ I turned off my phone because that’s who I am, that’s who I’m going to be. Sure enough, this was the year that they decided to call me and I don’t have a landline anymore. I only have my cell phone. So Bob [Milgrom’s co-laureate and PhD supervisor Robert Wilson] comes by and Bob made this really hard because not only did he wake me up, he rang the doorbell and said, ‘Paul, they’re trying to call you from Stockholm. You have won the Nobel Prize.’ He doesn’t say we have won the prize. He says, you have won a Nobel Prize. I wake up and I’m a little groggy, I’m still not fully awake and I’m thinking, ‘There’s something that’s wrong with this picture.’ A call from Stockholm that went to Bob at two in the morning and he’s come to my house to tell me that I won the Nobel Prize? I didn’t know what I was supposed to think. I’m trying to figure out what’s actually happening because I don’t quite believe what he’s saying and haven’t quite put it all together yet. So that’s what happened.;810;Impact of the Nobel on you
How has your life changed since receiving the award?;I’ve won lots of awards but nothing has the public impact like this prize. This is just completely different. But it’s also this combination of the Nobel Prize and the pandemic year. On my side, the pandemic year, it was already an unusually busy year. We’re asking the faculty just this one year to teach a little more and add some things. So I had added actually quite a lot to my schedule. I had more class teaching, teaching more hours, recording lectures. Then on top of that, once the prize came in there, thousands of extra emails and requests to give speeches and saying no, it’s really hard. There are perfectly reasonable requests, but there are too many of them. So that was one of the reasons I hired my daughter. She says no for me. And Alvin Roth [Prize in Economic Sciences 2012] gave me this ‘NO’ bell that is a great gift.;810;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How did you meet your co-laureate Robert Wilson?;"I got into graduate school at Stanford and then I wasn’t sure what to do to be a successful graduate student. I talked to a graduate student who was a year ahead of me, Bengt Holmström. He said, ‘The important thing is to get Bob Wilson to be your advisor. He’s the best advisor around here’.
So I decided I would take Bob’s class about current research and economics. Every year, he teaches a class where he goes over papers that are recently written and he went over one paper of his own and it was about auctions. I wanted to get his attention so I decided I would write my term paper to see if I could extend his work. Little did I know Bob had worked very hard on this problem. He’d been stumped and he had worked with another faculty member. I wrote a term paper, in which I solved the problem. He said, ‘This is a PhD thesis. This is it, you’re practically done.’ He was really excited and said, ‘Well, okay, it’s not quite a PhD thesis. You need to write an introduction. You need to write a literature review. Here’s all the papers you need to read better, but then you’ll be done.’ I finished very fast, two and a half years in graduate school.";810;Creativity
You received the prize for your work on auctions – have you ever won anything on an auction?;I don’t know if you’re into sports, but one of the most famous plays in a US sports history is something called ‘the catch’, which took place on 10 January 1982. I acquired that ball at auction with auction strategy. I saw that it was for sale at auction and the auction was badly designed, but I looked at it and said, ‘That’s not a well-designed auction. I’ll bet I can get it relatively cheap.’ And I did.;810;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Do you have a role model, mentor or teacher that has influenced you?;"Bob Wilson, but there’s another man who’s another Nobel Laureate actually – Kenneth Arrow, who’s always been my intellectual hero and who was my colleague here at Stanford for many years. He had multiple laureates among his students; Eric Maskin, Roger Myerson, Leonid Hurwicz. He devoted time to educating students. I spend a lot of time working with students as well.";810;Mentors (Role models)
Is diversity important in the field of economic sciences? What is your perspective on that?;My perspective mainly is that I want people to achieve what they’re capable of. I have some really talented people that are here and it’s a disappointment to me that only some of them are soaring. That must be that I’m failing the quieter students and the women in particular. It’s not so much that I’m aiming for diversity as I’m aiming for success and training for all of my students. It turns out what I’m doing now is better for the quieter men too. It’s even better for the noisier men. It just works better.;810;Diversity in sicence
What advice do you usually give to younger researchers?;"Don’t waste your time with things that aren’t going to matter. Make sure you have a couple of things going at a time, some stuff that’s trackable that you can make progress on and some stuff that you’d really like to make progress on that you’re thinking about.
Failure’s part of it. I also tell them stories about the greatest researchers and the failures that they’ve had. I’m not going to try to repeat them. They’re more or less confidential, but the most famous people in our profession have all had times when they bang their heads against something and failed. I tell them those stories and say don’t give up.";810;Advice for young scientists
What advice do you have on dealing with failure and unexpected problems?;"One of the things is that I want these guys to have portfolios and not be working on a single thing so that if they get stuck on something they could shift attention to something else. I think that it’s also dangerous. It can isolate you. That’s part of the reason for the social part of what I do. I think that people can become isolated and depressed and then they can go hide. I have to prevent that from happening. I’d like people to have in mind that there are lots of things they could be working on and they’re working on something right now, if it fails, there’s something else they can move to and get support and collaborate.
I was an assistant professor at Northwestern University. We had a group of people that included Roger Myerson, Bengt Holmström, Dale Mortensen who all are laureates. A group of young people, all of whom just thrived. We were not people who were getting offers from all the best places so how did this happen? I think that it’s partly social. It was a corridor we all worked in and we had lunch together every day in a coffee room. You could go in and see one guy explaining work to somebody else. We made comments on one another’s work, which were helpful. And yet we also competed. I would go out there and see Myerson and Holmström doing the work and say, ‘Holy cow, that’s awfully good. I’ve got to make my work better’. You’re comparing yourself to the others in a group but you also provide support. I’m trying to create a similar structure for my graduate students. One that support them in the way that I think I was supported in.";810;Creativity
How do you like to spend your free time?;"There’s something called free time? I don’t have a lot of free time, but I love spending time with family. When I was healthy (I had a knee replacement last year) I used to ski and I’m looking forward to skiing here again. I used to play tennis. We go hiking, we go for bike rides. I hang out with family, nice dinners.
I read some fiction, some nonfiction. I haven’t had much free time in the last months actually. So I haven’t done a lot of reading, but hope to get back to that. I have some books that I loved reading but then I get onto the next one. It’s like in my research to write the thing that I’m most excited about is usually something recent. That’s how I am, I move on.";810;Free time
You’ve been to four Nobel Prize banquets and I heard that you met your wife at one of them. Can you tell us about that?;"I was there because William Vickrey, who won the prize along with James Mirrlees in 96, had a heart attack and died and they needed somebody to give the prize lecture. I was invited to give a portion of that lecture. They seated Eva next to me during the dinner. We had a really good time during the dinner. I really liked her. I thought she liked me. We danced and we had a good time. I could tell you more stories about the dinner, but I got home and I thought, ‘Well, am I going to do anything about this? She lives in Stockholm. I live in California. I’m going to reach out to her and she’s going to talk to her girlfriends and they’re all going to say he lives in California. That can’t work.’ I am a game theorist so I decided I needed to make a move that would counter that. So I sent her a really nice letter. I told her how much I enjoyed our evening and that I really wanted to see her again. Given that she lived in Stockholm and I lived in California, I would send her a plane ticket to meet her anywhere in the world. We got married around 20 years ago.
Ten years later, we were invited back by the Nobel Foundation to celebrate our 10th meeting anniversary and to give a press interview. I have to tell you this story too, because I delivered the best one-liner of my life in this interview. During an interview they asked me, ‘How do you feel about the fact that it wasn’t you who won the Nobel Prize?’ I replied, ‘Oh, I’m the one who went home with the big prize back here.’ It’s the best line of my life because people were talking about that line for the whole next year. I wish I could come up with a line that good again, but it just came right out of me.";810;Impact of the Nobel on you
What made you decide to pursue economic sciences?;"It’s a rather strange circumstance. I wasn’t actually trained as an economist and I hadn’t gone to a business school back in college. I majored in mathematics and philosophy. But then there was a professor at my college. He was going to the business school. He was moving from a statistics department to the business school and I liked him a lot. So I went to the business school and from there I got a job after the doctoral degree.
There was a time in my career in the mid-sixties when I sort of got interested in economics and game theory. I sort of learnt it on my own and I didn’t have training in it, but I acquired an interest in it. It was more accidental. I was sort of led into it by, I was curious about the subject matter and I just had to learn more in order to understand it and do research in that area. I was always shooting multi-person problems. Game theory involves more than one person in a strategic situation. So even without game theory, I was still interested in how people coordinate and cooperate.";811;Motivation
Do you have a defining moment where you decided that this is what you wanted to do?;I took a visiting term at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. There I was working with economists and I liked it. Two years later I had a sabbatical year, which I then spent in the economics department at Stanford. So that was a defining moment where I said, okay, I’m going to take a whole year. I got to study economics. I got to live with the economists, I’ll have an office at the economics department. I kept with it and from there on I was really heavily involved in economics.;811;Motivation
Is there a particular teacher or mentor that really has influenced you?;Later in my career, as I became involved in economics and game theory, I think there were these very influential older scholars that during the 1970s had a lot of influence on my thinking. One was Lloyd Shapley, who was a game theorist and got a Nobel prize by the way. Another was Robert Aumann who would come every summer to Stanford and he too got a Nobel Prize. So those had a lot of influence on me. But before that, I can’t think of there being a particular mentor along the way. I sort of drifted through college without any particular direction or mentor. I had come from a very small town in farm country, in the Midwest. Going to Harvard was a shock for me, a cultural shock. I was unprepared for it. Most of the fellow students had gone into prep schools and had lots of prior work and I just drifted along without a focus. In some ways my undergraduate education was kind of wasted. It didn’t have any focus to it.;811;Mentors (Role models)
Many of your previous students have become laureates and they have said you were a great mentor – what is your view on teaching and being a role model?;It’s a little mysterious as to why I’m considered a good teacher, because I actually haven’t done very much! I do have a course that’s apparently been very influential. For around 50 years now I’ve taught a PhD course that tries to convey what the frontiers of research are in the application of game theory to problems in economics. So of course, I worked very hard on that course, and I think it’s influenced a lot of the students.;811;Mentors (Role models)
Do you have any advice that you usually give to your students?;As a teacher, mostly I’ve just encouraged my students. I like them. I admire what they’re doing. I encourage them to work on what they’re interested in and they usually just pursue it with a lot of interest in vigor because it is their own interests. Unfortunately, this is very difficult these days because young people feel they have to do empirical work in order to get a job and that the golden days of theory are kind of over.;811;Advice for young researchers
What qualities do you think a successful scientist needs to have?;"There are different kinds of scientific endeavors. I mean, certainly the people doing empirical work, they’re just trying to find out what really is going on here, they have this curiosity about what is the truth. I’m more of a theorist and for me it just requires this kind of unrelenting curiosity. You have to be curious about something that’s really minor. When I started my work in economics, the prevailing model was what we call generally equilibrium theory. It was an elaborate theory that has a main purpose to show that there would exist prices that could make a demand equal supply in all or many markets.
The curiosity that drove me was where do these prices come from? Who sets them? Are they set by dealers and brokers or who are quoting prices?
The thing is that it only takes the slightest bit of curiosity to then lead you down a whole trail of interesting questions to study. I encourage young people to just have a little bit of curiosity about something basic from fundamental and then pursue it.";811;Competencies
Your three students that become laureates – can you tell us a bit about them?;"All three students Alvin Roth, Bengt Holmström and Paul Milgromare extremely talented, intelligent and skilled people. It’s not surprising that they do well. They would do well working with anybody. It’s not clear that I had a particular role. We were just very lucky. I was very lucky to have such talented students. You can see they were very talented. It’s turned out that way.
I can tell you a story about Bengt Holmström when his time was up at Stanford. The money was running out and he had a post-doc fellowship to go to – he only had about eight weeks left and he still had not written his dissertation. He locked himself in a room and worked steadily for six weeks. He produced this magnificent manuscript all in one in this intensive period. Then he went, with this post-doctoral fellowship, to the University of Louvain. He traveled through Germany to there from Finland. As they traveled through Germany to get to Louvain in Belgium, they stopped in a little town. While the car was parked outside the hotel, his manuscript was stolen. It turned out that he put an advertisement in the paper, in that town in Germany, saying ‘This is a terrible thing. My briefcase that has my doctoral dissertation in it has been stolen.’ It turns out that the thief’s mother read that and demanded that her son returned it and he got his dissertation back";811;Creativity
Your co-laureate is a previous student of yours, Paul Milgrom. How did the two of you meet?;"During the mid 1970s, I’m a professor at [Stanford] business school. After finishing college, Paul Milgrom worked seven years as an actuary. Then he came to the MBA program, and my colleague identified Paul Milgrom as this exceptional MBA student with strong analytical and mathematical skills. We invited him to transfer from the MBA program into the PhD program, which he did. My understanding of this story is that he asked Bengt Holmström which advisors he should choose and Holmström said, ‘well, you should work with Bob Wilson’.
I was the chairman of the committee for his thesis and that’s how it started. We had a little seminar series where we would meet at least every week. We would be pursuing topics, I was particularly interested at that time in auctions. I’d done some sort of exploratory work, but it wasn’t very deep rigorous, but Paul had these tremendous skills. He did very rigorous analysis of these topics in auctions.";811;Creativity
Are you still working together?;We haven’t done any joint work since that time but we’re friends. He and his wife Eva go hiking together with me and Mary. Eva’s quite a hostess so she invites us over for dinner and there’ll be large groups of people and an absolutely beautiful banquet of food. She’s quite the entertainer.;811;Creativity
How did you end up informing Paul Milgrom about the prize?;The Swedish Academy of Sciences called us, it was 1:40 in the morning. Since this is in the period before the election, I thought it was one of these political advertisements. So I turned off the phone, but fortunately the Swedish Academy knew my wife’s cell phone number and they called her. Then we talked to them and the chairman of the committee said, ‘well, we’re actually having problems reaching Paul Milgrom and we understand he lives across the street. Could you go over and wake him up?’ My wife and I put on clothes and went across the street. The reason there’s a video of this is that they have a system at the front of their house, that the doorbell where the chime that you would push the bell in order to ring at the door, it’s actually a camera and a microphone. As we approached the door, it’s taking a picture of us and recording what we’re saying. It’s sending all of this over the internet to Paul Milgram’s wife, Eva Myerson Milgrom, who was in Stockholm because she’s Swedish and visiting her son, granddaughter and mother. At that very moment, it was like 10 in the morning in Stockholm so she’s trying to talk to us, but we don’t hear her very well so we’re trying to get to through to Paul and knock on the door and say, ‘You’ve won a Nobel Prize!’ So that was a lot of fun actually and this video got distributed all over the world within hours.;811;The impact of nobel on you
How does it feel to share the prize with Paul Milgrom?;It is fun. For the award ceremony, because of the pandemic, it could not be done any other way than here. The council came and it was held in Milgram’s backyard patio. The whole ceremony was filmed just in the patio. That was a lot of fun.;811;Impact of Nobel prize on you
You have been to a Nobel Prize award ceremony before, haven’t you?;I came to Holmström’s award ceremony in Stockholm [in 2016]. I dressed up in white tie and tails. My wife and I were his guests and we sat up at the third balcony for the ceremony. We went to the banquet and had a lovely time.;811;Impact of the Nobel on you
How do you cope with failure?;There are lots of problems where I’ve worked on the problem for a year, failed to solve it, and then finally reluctantly given up on it. Since I retired, I have a problem I’ve worked on for nine years and I’m still working on that. Once I’m hooked on a problem and I think I know the answer, but I can’t prove it to be true, it’s very frustrating. It’s like a dog gnawing on a bone that won’t give it up, you know? So that’s hard.;811;Creativity
What do you like to do in your spare time?;"These days, I’m 83. I used to be interested in gardening, I’m kind of too old to maintain the garden now. I have a gardener that does it so I don’t actually work in at that much anymore, but I used to do it.
Nowadays, we spend more time on birds. But hiking is our main thing. My wife and I like to go hiking. Normally every Wednesday we go on a hike – so that is probably what we will do after this call.";811;Free time
Can you tell us about your childhood?;I grew up in a middle-class family in the city of Kolkata. I, just by accident more or less, happened to live right next door to one of the biggest slums in Kolkata, so I had a slightly resentful childhood in the sense that I was surrounded by kids who didn’t go to school, who was playing all day, whereas I had to go to this extremely boring school every day. My parents had different expectations and so I would see the people who I would play marbles with, playing while I go to school, and playing when I came back from school. The exposure, I think, early exposure to the fact that people, poor people – my parents sort of explained to me that this was poor people, that they have very different lives – was, I think, in some ways it kept with me in the sense that I would say that I think I became more of an economist in trying to understand how I can connect the economic theory that I knew which really said nothing about why the poor would be different in any way. To the ideas that, you know, all the exposure, to the kinds of facts of the world that I came with. These two languages were not particularly commensurate and so it took me a little while to understand that, how to translate one into the other.;812;Life
How did you end up in economics?;I ended up in economics by accident. I wanted to study mathematics and I went to study mathematics, there is a special dedicated, very well-known institute in Kolkata called Indian Statistical Institute where they give you an undergraduate degree in mathematics and I went there and I realized that I wasn’t cut out for it. It was not because I was not good at maths, because I was actually pretty good at maths, but because I didn’t like the social life of that place, it was too serious, too kind of ‘heavy’. And so I decided I need to study something else, and in India, if you don’t kind of plan your strategy, the only way you can change fields is by you losing a year, and I didn’t want to do that, so I decided to find out study something else. What can I get into at this late date? And the answer was economics, so I went into economics.;812;Motivation
What’s your relationship with India today?;I think I my mind I have always been an Indian, I mean, it doesn’t matter where I live or what affiliation or citizenship. It is really much more about what’s the social milieu that directly inspires you, what the social milieu you react to. Who are the people who you think of when you do anything good or bad, you think of certain people and those people for me are, I mean lots of them are in India and there’s somehow that India matters to me in a sense in which I think no other country matters to me.;812;Environment
How can we better understand poverty?;"To be honest I think the sense from our research has been that actually someway the same insights goes for poor people in many places. Maybe not in Sweden where maybe it’s just very different to be poor because of the social welfare networks are much better, but I have worked in Indonesia, in Ghana, in Kenya, in India, which are very different places. I would say, the similarities are more striking than the differences. I think people are both creative and often, sort of … I think the idea that the poor are sort of fixed machines which have no choice, is all wrong. People are both, I mean, poor people have enjoyed their lives, they look for opportunities, they try things, they are also scared by them, they make mistakes, all of the things that we do, they do. So, in that sense I don’t think that one needs a different sense of psychology to study the poor.
The poor, I think, in fact I would say, what we often miss with the poor is precisely the opposite which is that they have the same psychology as us. We often underestimate how important that is which is that we think the poor, they are starving so they must only want to eat nutritious food. But in fact, they don’t, because they also want to have fun, so they might sacrifice some nutritious food to eat something that’s tasty. And I think that’s the psychology that we have as well, we would not going to just stay on a diet eating, whatever, quinoa every day, we are going to have something delicious sometimes. I think in that sense, I don’t think the psychology is deeply different. And I don’t think it is deeply different across the world either.";812;Research
How is your work connected to climate change?;"I think the question of climate changes is central to the challenges that the poor will face in the next fifty years. Being from Kolkata, I always think of what’s going to happen in the southern Bengal delta which stretches across India and Bangladesh. I’m guessing 150 to 200 million people live there, all of that would be under water, unless we do something drastic. Where will these people go? There’s 200 million people, that’s many times the population of Sweden, where will these people go? It’s really no one has an answer, nobody really thought about it, suddenly it’s not easy to think of them as emigrating somewhere else, that many people, so what’s going to happen to those people? It’s one of these completely frightening questions. They are mostly poor people living on small amounts of land which is all going to disappear. What’s going to happen to them, what’s going to happen to their living? I don’t think that it’s a more pressing question from the lives of the poor than finding a life to deal with climate change.
On the other side, I would say that our learning from the work with the poor and in general from experimental work, is that it is not that costly to make the adjustment to a different lifestyle. I think people once they see that other people are doing it they often just do it and if they do it then it sort of sticks. It’s not that hard to get people to change their mind, if you just send people a notice which says: “You are among the top ten percent of energy users among your neighbourhood”, that reduces energy consumption. It’s a letter they read, it is okay, fine, we can switch of the light or whatever. I don’t see any reasons why in America you have to have 75 degrees inside in the winter and 65 in the summer. That seems backwards somehow. There is just so many things that seems gratuitous in the way we consume energy that it seems to me that it is also a matter of political will and of finding creative solutions that people don’t think of as onerous. I think if you put all this together I would say that on one side I feel that this is absolutely critical moment to act, the other side, I really don’t believe it so hard to do so.";812;Future research (interests)
How important is it to have fun in your life and work?;Enormously important, I must say that I get bored with everything I do unless I have some relief. I try to arrange my day so that it is at least one or two hours when I am doing something that I’m genuinely enjoying, usually more than one or two hours. Three or four hours when I actually enjoy whatever I am doing. I love cooking so I cook almost every day for an hour and a half or so. I like playing racket sports so I usually arrange my day to either play tennis or ping pong or badminton or something like that. And I like being with my kids, so I try to arrange my days so there is enough relief, otherwise I get bored out of my mind very quickly.;812;Creativity
Do you like teaching? Was there a teacher that inspired you?;I really love teaching and one of the things in which I have invested a lot of my life is in kind of changing the way our field of development economics has had a start. I think one of the things that I would say I take some credit for is in the way, in many places now the courses start this, I see my students have gone and they teach the same kinds of things. I do think that teaching is extraordinary important and, in my life, I think, you know, both my parents are economists and they taught me an enormous amount among others. There were other teachers that were inspiring too, but my parents in very different ways. My mother is a kind of a passionate activist and my father is a very cool collected, very careful debater, where both have been, both very salient influences in my life.;812;Mentors (Role models)
Can you tell us about your work in films?;I got into filmmaking out of a sudden frustration with my ability to capture in my research the things that I was hearing. There were so many wonderful stories that people tell. If you interview people the things that’s striking is that of course, you ask them: “How many times did you go to the health care centre in the last six months?” and they don’t just say: “Four”, they say: “Oh yeah, I went three times, but those are the other times when I went and the door was closed, does that count?” or “I went three times and there was the other time when the doctor shooed me away, so does that count?”. You hear that piece, and you say: “Where do I record that?” and I think the sense of that we have a whole narrative around each data point, and those narratives are interesting by themselves, and there’s a way, there’s a need to capture them. That was what inspired and an attempt to make documentaries.;812;Creativity
What’s your hope for the future?;My hope for the next 15 years is very much that I continue to do what I am doing. I enjoy very much what I am doing, I think that this might open some more doors, give us a chance to do some more useful interventions or study some more useful interventions, make the case that these things actually matter. Maybe people will listen to us a little bit more as a result of the prize. I’m not envisioning a chance in my lifestyle.;812;Future Research
How did you become interested in economics?;"I grew up in a suburb of Paris, in a family with three children. My father is a mathematician and my mother is a pediatrician. Nothing really remarkable about my childhood except for the fact that my mother was involved in a small NGO of doctors who were helping children victims of war. She used to have her regular work in Paris but then from time to time she would spend a few weeks away to do this work, to help the children of the war. I think very early on we got from that a sense that there were some children who had very different experiences growing up and that gave us children a sense of how fortunate we were and maybe how responsible we were of doing something with this good fortune. From this experience I always hoped that some part of my life would be devoted to fighting poverty but I didn’t really know which part. Growing up I thought I would have some career and then on the side I would work on an NGO, very much like my mom. But after some point in the middle of college, I thought maybe this is not entirely satisfactory, that my entire life should be devoted to this and not just something I would do on the side.
I thought maybe I would go into politics or I wasn’t quite sure. I decided spend take a year to think about it, I went to Russia for one year and there I was doing various things, but one of the things I was doing is to be an assistant for economists who were helping with the transition in Russia at the time from communism to capitalism. And in this context I realized how influential economists could be and I thought this is actually perfect, because I had always envisioned myself as an academic, because I am more like the sort of quiet, reflective type and I wanted to do science and I thought with this job I can do my science and at the same time when I have something to say I can really have a role in policy. So that is when I really decided to go into economics.";813;Motivation
Can you tell us about your relationship with India?;"India is the place where I first went as a graduate student to start doing field work. And I kind of learned that in Calcutta as a graduate student in my early 20s with no understanding of anything really, and with a lot of misconceptions about what it was to be poor, in particular the centered around Calcutta. Because somehow I was a bit obsessed about poverty in Calcutta as a child having grown with Mother Teresa and the like. And I arrived in Calcutta and I was kind of shown how different the life of the poor really is and how they were kind of going about their business and being under-pricing and having issues but not being like the helpless people that I kind of had in the corner of my mind. From then on; it was kind of a lot of my education as a development economist and as a human being was through the work that I did in India. And then of course now, my husband is Indian, my in-laws are Indian, most of my work is in India so that is kind of a second home for me.";813;Creativity
What have you learnt from your travels?;I think you learn that people are not so different, maybe it is one of the biggest things that I have learnt, that people live in very different circumstances and that of course has implications on what they can achieve and what they can do with their lives, but at heart we have the same type of strengths as human beings and of weaknesses. They just happen to be dipped into different contexts.;813;Mentor(Role Models)
What can economics tell us about migration?;"I think the biggest misconception that people who are against migration have are two. One is that everybody wants to move from poor countries to rich countries and profoundly if there was no restriction this is the first thing that would happen. And the second is that should they come this would have a large impact on the wages of people here and particularly low-skilled people here. And it turns out both things are just factually incorrect. In practice, a lot of people who have the opportunity to move don’t, so even within country migration from one place to another is very low. People don’t move from the rural area of India to the urban area of India so they are not going to move to Sweden.
People don’t move from the places that get hit by economic shocks in the US to other places that don’t get hit by the same shocks. Fundamentally, people prefer to stay at home. And if you were to remove all the migration barrier the flows would not be that big. That is the first thing. The second thing is that even when there are big migration flows, which usually comes because of a crisis, for example the Syrian crisis did push a lot of people out. It is not that they wanted to go out, it is that they had no choice. But even when that happens all of the history suggests that when there were such episodes, they weren’t big impact on the wages of the natives. If anything in some cases you can see that it leads to a small increase in native wages and in employment, not decrease. So that is the second misconception. So once you remove these two misconceptions there is really no reason to be that scared of migration one way or the another.";813;Diversity in sicence
Do you feel that being a woman has affected your work as a scientist?;"I do think that women tend to have different interests than men. I don’t think it is coming from biology, but it is probably coming from early education of girls versus boys. I certainly see in the field of economics, development economics, the study of poor countries, it is the only field that is really more or less equally men and women working in this field. A lot of women come to economics because they want to study questions that have direct implications on the lives of others and can have direct impact on how to do better policy – development economics, public economics, health economics, education. So I do think that being a woman has influenced, probably is one reason why I am interested in development economics. That is of course the most important but apart from that I don’t think there are necessarily vast differences in the way that being a woman specifically has influenced my work.
Of course I have a very specific way of working but it is hard for me to say where it is coming from. But certainly I think one reason why there are few Nobel Prize winners in economics is that there are few women in economics, very few. And I think one of the reasons is that many young women don’t think to even go into the field because they do not realise that those topics are also part of economics. And I do hope that giving the prize to development, not only to a woman among the laureates, but just even the topic is going to make them aware that that is a possibility, those are part of the topics that economists study and therefore are going to serve as kind of a role model for more women to come into the field.";813;Diversity in sicence
How can we encourage more women to pursue economics?;I think there are already two ways to increase the fraction of women in economics. The first one is making people aware that economics also addresses those issues, social issues, climate, poverty, all part of economics and you know not just interest rate, making banks bigger. The second thing is the culture itself in economics is not very friendly. It is a very aggressive culture, very in-your-face culture which many women don’t particular like. There I think the profession can improve by being mindful of having a somewhat more civil way of engaging with each other. And I do think that actually this is already changing, that in the last few years there has been a realization that it is not okay to be aggressive and rude etcetera, one has to … the whole field has to become more gentle.;813;Advice for female scientists
How is your work tied to climate change?;"The work on poverty is intimately connected to any work on climate change for two reasons. The first one is that climate change is going to affect, is already affecting the poor countries more than anywhere else. First of all because the poor countries are in the south where it is already hot and second of all because there are fewer ways to adapt. For example it is in Bangladesh places are literally going to go under water. It is in India, where some parts of India are going to become inhabitable because it is too hot and so on and so forth. So that is the fact that it is in the south. And the fact that there are less ways to adapt is for example when there is a heat wave in France it ruined … Last year there was one last summer, it doesn’t kill anyone because we know what to do and we also have the means to adjust to it so we can make sure that everybody is in a cool place and there are enough places with air condition where the old and fragile people can be protected. And it is a matter of organization, so the first heat wave killed many people and the second one didn’t.
In India there are just fewer air conditions for people living in rural area, where are they to go? They have to continue living and the agriculture is not resilient to the heat and so on and so forth. So they have less ability to adapt and therefore it is much much more costly. And the same number of hot days in India kills more people than it does in America or Sweden if you have hot days sometimes. So that is one reason why I think the change in the planet’s climate could easily undo all of the progress or most of the progress that has been made in fighting poverty in the last few years.
The second reason although most of the responsibility for climate change lies with the rich countries there might be some opportunity in poor countries to do things that are going to preserve the environment. For example the forest is not depleted yet in some places so you could try and keep it. There could be ways to compensate people to keep it etcetera. So there are still areas that not have been made yet in the poor countries in the way that they are going that could have an influence on climate change in the future. That is why I think for these two reasons you can’t really be a development economist and not be worried about climate and vice versa, you can’t be concerned about sustainability and not think about the south. Let me just add that with that said I think that the effort and really the bulk of the action in terms of sustainability world will have to be a reduction in consumption in rich countries, because that is really where we are, just consuming too much, period.";813;Future research (interests)
What can we do to create a more sustainable world?;"I have one hope which is that peoples … Sometimes economics tend to think that people always … that all that people want is to consume more and have bigger cars and more air condition in the summer and more heat in the winter. But I think that people’s likes and preferences and needs are much more influenceable than that. So when you see a movement like the youth movement, for example Greta’s work here, it could be enough to create enough of awareness of the issue that people become aware that it is not okay to let the planet warm and it is not just about polar bears, if you don’t care about polar bears, it is also about people.
Most economists tend to be a bit distrustful of the ability of individuals to care about other individuals, particularly people who are far away, but I actually don’t think that is true. I think that people can easily be taught to care. Once they are taught to care I think they can also relative easily adjust to a change in their own consumption because we are creatures of habits and I think if we change a little bit the way we behave then we can get used to that so that it doesn’t become that difficult. The consumption per capita of someone in Sweden is much lower than someone in America and I don’t think the Swedes are unhappier. It is just that they got used to take the subway, the tramway to work. I think we can get there in the sense that I think it will require changes in the way we behave here but I don’t think these changes are necessarily sacrifices.";813;Meaning (Values) of Work
Can you tell us about your approach to solving problems?;"I think it is very important to ask questions that can be answered. And that can be answered in as rigorous and scientific way as possible. The question can be broader or it can be narrow but it should be specific. For example there are questions you can ask through experiments that have vast implications, for example “Is private school better than public school?”. That doesn’t seem to be a narrow question, but it is a pretty well defined question. And you can set up an experiment that compares the expense of children in a system that is mostly private school and the same in mostly public school, by creating an experiment where some villages have private school voucher offering and some villages don’t. So that is not a narrow question, that is a broad question but that is one you can set up an experiment for.
I think to me it is very essential to try to ask these questions that are very well defined and on which you can train your kind of gaze as a scientist in trying to answer them rigorously and that involve usually not answering the whole problem you would like to answer at once. I don’t have answer on whether aid work, I don’t have answer on whether all countries should be like China. Because to me the questions are not even very well defined. But I can answer a question on “Would kids to better in a system where they have free access to private school?” or “Would kids do better in a system where school is provided by the government?”. That’s kind of how I see the differences. And once you have your very well defined questions, you can set up an experiment, very much like you test the effectiveness of a drug in medicine, you can look at the effect of the program or the effect of the intervention or the effect of structuring your school system for example.";813;Creativity
What are your hobbies?;I would say I am an ex-climber, I used to climb a lot before having children. But now I think, first of all I have less time and second of all, my husband think that I should be sure to be alive for my children, so I should not take some unnecessary risk. So now I do all sorts of … I still climb but indoors, and I do all sorts of other activity like running, playing tennis and hiking.;813;Free time
How is your working relationship with your co-laureate Michael Kremer?;Michael was a young assistant professor at MIT when I came as a graduate student and was really the kind of visionary in seeing how you could start using experiments in the field. They existed as a technique but almost nobody had used them. And Michael, and then Michael and Abhijit together started doing this work. First of all really feeling their way around and as a student I was watching this happening and this was really incredibly exciting to know that was like a tool that could be exploited to us. As soon as I could, as soon as I got my PhD I got involved in this work as well. And since then, of course we have been working, Michael was one of the first few affiliates of our network, J-PAL. We were eight researchers at the beginning when we created the network and he was one of them. Of course, Michael’s wife Rachel Glennerster who is now the chief economist at DFID and was for fifteen years the executive director of J-PAL and grew it from these eight people to 200 affiliates and 200 fellow travellers. I have a lot of work with Michael, I worked with him in Kenya on several projects and we are still involved in a work, in a big project in Ghana together. And it is kind of, I think we are very different the three of us, in what we bring to the table so it is always a huge pleasure to work with them.;813;Creativity
What does the prize mean to you?;I think what the Nobel Prize gives us is a chance for leveraging the work we have done so far and give it even more presence. Really the way you achieve any success in the fight against poverty is by working with development country governments. It is not really NGOs or foreign aid or one of us who can make a difference, everything happens in the development country governments themselves when they, if their policy work better and they are able to design better policy to achieve the problem that they are thinking about. And we have already started on this journey where we really work more and more with governments, not just to give them suggestions but to kind of learn together. And I think this will help even more in terms of opening doors and making, reassuring various governments with whom we are not yet working, you know this is legitimate and not a strange undertaking by some crazy people so I think that will help a lot. And I also hope that it is going to contribute to bring many more people to the field, researchers and also to bring money to do all this work so the whole thing should kind of move on to one more level of intensity I am very much hoping. And then the second thing is related to these climate discussions we were having a little bit earlier, I would hope that a lot of work also gets focused on these issues, both in rich countries and in poor countries.;813;Impact of Nobel prize on you

What’s the source of your passion for economic sciences?;"So my passion for economics. It comes from many sources; I think the biggest one is for the benefit of humanity or mankind as we used to call it. Humanity, and also not just for humanity but for the broader world around us. I thought when I first began working on economics that it was clear that there were many economic problems that were unsolved. I think the ones I was most interested in when I first started was poverty and macroeconomics for business cycles. I still am interested in those, but I wird off into other areas particularly environmental economics and resource economics later, but the big passion was I thought economics was a tool that one could use, like a carpenter uses a tool to build something, it was an intellectual tool to be used to improve people’s well-being.";815;Motivation
How has your upbringing shaped you?;My upbringing in New Mexico, I’d say was very focused on the outdoors. My father was interested in the outdoors, interested in skiing, fishing and building things, interesting things like tramways. He was interested in Indian law at that time and in the later part of his life became one of the nation’s leading Indian lawyers, so all this had to do with the outdoors. And so, when I moved east to a more urban environment, I had that in my background.;815;Family/Home Environment
What interests you about climate change?;"My interest in climate change was a natural outgrowth of interests that evolved over time. So, when I first became seriously interested in economics in graduate school, I was primarily interested in economic growth. I think it is quite interesting that the prize this year, which is really about economic growth, was what my interest, actually has been my interest all my life in economics. And I started working on that, working on the technology, and for four or five years I worked on exactly the same areathat Paul Romer got his prize for, but I gave it up, it was too hard, so it was just too hard for me so I moved on. And then I started worrying about … But it was the same issue that the technology Romer deals with which is that markets cannot solve certain problems, markets are very good at some things, they allocate bread, they allocate gasoline, but they don’t allocate technology efficiently and they don’t allocate energy and environmental issues efficiently.
I was always interested in the by-products of economic growth and so I worked first on energy and then, well, I have always worked on energy, I should say. And then gradually looked at some of the by-products of energy production and that very quickly led to climate change. I think that the place that sort of crystallized that for me was in 1974. I went to a new institute that had been formed in Vienna called the International Institute for Applied Systems Analyses or IIASA. At that time, it was just an extraordinary crop of brilliant, brilliant people. Director Howard Raiffa from Harvard, my colleagues Tjalling Koopmans and Alan Manne from Stanford being among them, and there was a man named Allan Murphy, a brilliant climatologist, I shared an office with and so we naturally got started, and he said: “Why don’t you think about this?” and so I started thinking about climate change.";815;Future research (interests)
How can your work be used to take better care of the planet?;"I think the main message of the work, not just my work, but the work of people in the area of climate change economics, the integrated assessment modelling as it is called, a technical name, is really twofold; one is it to see the climate change problem as a by-product, an unintended by-product of economic growth and then the second thing is to understand that what we need to do is we need to correct that by fixing the price of emissions so now emissions are free in most places, not in Sweden, but every place else in the world outside of Western Europe. When you admit a ton of carbon dioxide you don’t probably know you’re doing it or think of doing it probably, you drive your car, or you have a product that has combustion behind it, that you are putting in the atmosphere, and you are causing damage, but you are not paying anything for it. So, the inside of economics is when you go through that and you analyse it to say we need to put a price on these, and that way give people incentives to reduce their use of carbon fuels or the product that use carbon fuels and thereby reduce their emissions.
The key message of economics is that this is a flaw in the market and it’s correctable. If governments take steps to change the price from zero to a high enough price, then you can meet your target. So that data is pretty easy to explain, but then the next step is, what is that price? And I think the most interesting thing about all the work I’ve ever done, is building models of this – the price just comes out of it. It’s just one of the by-products of the … it’s called linear programming, it’s a technical name for it but it has another technical thing, called a dual variable, which is, this is the price that you should set on carbon dioxide emissions if you’re going to meet your goal. I think of it as kind of a mathematical miracle in the sense that you can do this and out pops the price that the government should set.";815;Roles of Science
What can an individual do to help the climate?;My message is, you by yourself can do nothing. There are too many people doing too much for too many generations of people so even if I’m the most ethical person or even if I’m not just an ethical person that I’m going to represent ten or hundred other people who are not so ethical or don’t care about it, the effect I alone, I want to emphasize the word alone, will have is insignificant, it’s like a billionth of a billionth or trillionth of what is necessary. So, what is necessary is that people act through their governments and their governments act together with other nations to take steps to solve this problem. I don’t want to say there’s a single step you can take, because there are multiple things to do, but I’d say the message is you need to exercise your duties and responsibilities as citizens, as voters on places where they’re not voters, where there’s no democracies as protesters, work through governments, work through non-profit organizations, work through schools to persuade people that we need to take steps to do this. There is nothing wrong with taking the step by yourself to curb your own emissions, to turn the heat down or whatever. That’s fine, but that by itself is not sufficient.;815;Future research (interests)
What is your outlook for the future of climate change?;I’ve been working on this long enough to see that things change and change slowly. I’d say over the period since I have been working, I started work on this in the 1970s, there has been a lot of progress in the science, the social sciences more than natural sciences. I’ve seen considerable changes in viewpoint of professionals, of scientists, interested scientists, concerned citizens. I think there are now a great realization of the problem, the solutions and so on. So in that respect I think it’s been a good moment. At the same time the politics has moved backwards in the last, say, last couple of years, maybe more, maybe a little bit more, with people, particularly the American president, who makes ludicrous statements about climate change, but I think it spreads, it is a little spread so in all of our big countries we have problems of leaders who are really not thinking about global problems, not even thinking about problems often in a sensible way. So what I would like to say is two steps forward one step backwards, maybe it’s a big step backward now, but I’m hopeful that we will get over that and move forward again.;815;Future research (interests)
How important is education in relation to climate change?;"People often learn their social, political, scientific views when they are in school and they get hardwired into their brain and their emotions and it’s sometimes very difficult for people to change. Often our leaders will be taught things 20, 30, 40, 50 years old and so they’re not really ready for the challenges of today, they are not ready for the challenge of the climate change. Climate change is one example, another one is cyber security. I think the people have, the people in leadership in the world don’t actually know anything about information technology so how can they perceive the threats of it. And I think it is now changing a little bit, but when it first came these people know nothing about computers, how can they possibly understand the threats of cybersecurity, so it’s little the same as with climate change. They grew up, they went to college, so I view the most important job that I do is teaching because people at college age, I think of 18-22, they have the most amazing open and plastic minds. I’m just absolutely astounded.
The students will come in at the beginning, let’s say teaching macroeconomics, and will know nothing, they know nothing about international trade, nothing about how the exchange rate works, they will know nothing about how the economy is affected. But by the end of the time they basically know what a professional economist knows. It’s just so easy and the they will forget half of it, of course, but somewhere deep in their brain they will know it, so when they run into it five or 10 or 20 or 30 years later, say: “Yes, I learned that at Yale”. This is the generation I love working with because there is a brilliance of minds but also a plasticity and an ability to absorb new ideas and to challenge also when poor ideas are put to them. So that is what teaching means to me.";815;Future research (interests)
Did you have a teacher who inspired you?;I had so many of them. I was just blessed, both at Yale as an undergraduate and at MIT as a graduate student and then in a way also in my professional life as having so many teachers, teachers and often later colleagues and co-authors. I think the one that I, in this area, in climate change, the one I particularly point to, would be Tjalling Koopmans. Tjalling Koopmans who’s Dutch, and he left Holland right before World War II, he was very much aware of the Nazi menace in Western Europe. He went to America, he worked in America, in mathematics and he invented his very important linear programme technique when he was working on shipping convoys in WWII. He went to Chicago and then he went to Yale and he was a colleague at Yale. He influenced me, not just because he was interested in energy and climate change, but because of his enthusiastic … and also his mentorship, he wasn’t really mentor at that stage, it was more his enthusiasm for the subject and his enthusiasm for my work. And the techniques he used were different from what everyone else was using and what I pointed out to earlier, this business about the shadow price, the dual variable that gives you the price of carbon, came out of work he did. If I hadn’t used that technique, I wouldn’t have found it. Actually, I think he was the first person I ever found mention climate change in a Nobel Lecture or speeches. In December 1975 he actually mentioned it in his toast at the banquet. I just mention him because he was a wonderful colleague, a brilliant, brilliant Nobel Prize winning economist and just a very generous man as well. But there were many, many others, but since in this context I would particular associate with Tjalling Koopmans.;815;Mentors (Role models)
How does it feel to share the prize with Paul Romer?;"I think it’s wonderful, it’s wonderful to share this with Paul Romer for lots of reasons. One is that I have a great admiration for his work. What Paul Romer got the prize for as you will explain, is opening up the box of technological change. In the earlier work that had been done in economic growth, the work that I learned in graduate school, technological change was taken as a given, it was known as exogenous, falling from heaven and not produced by humans, it just comes to you. And everybody knew that’s wrong, everybody knows we produce great technologies, we produced the steam engine, the idea for the steam engine and the steam engine, the idea for the transistor and the transistor and modern electronics, the idea for the telephone and then the telephone, and now the telecommunications. Everybody knows it didn’t just come floating down from some intellectual heaven, but it was invented by people, but it wasn’t in our models.
We knew this, I actually tried to work on that myself, as I said, it was too hard, so I gave it up. But that was the problem that Paul Romer tackled and solved and produced this really brilliant new way of thinking about technologies. I think it’s really nice for me to share with Paul, partly because that was a problem I thought about, worked on and failed at when I was a graduate student. And partly also, coming to today, because it’s clear that the solutions to problems like climate change involve exactly what he is talking about, finding ways to induce new technologies, finding ways to get people to think about them, to invent them, to develop the products and processes to make sure they are commercial, to get them out in the world. This is the issue he saw and using his insights in the climate change area, marrying those two, is a critical, critical need over the next few years if we are to succeed.";815;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Where do you do your best thinking?;"One of the things to understand, it’s not a linear process, it’s not, you sit down with a blank piece of paper. I know nobody thinks this, but just to emphasize, you sit down with your paper and you say, climate change and underline and say, number 1, number 2, number 3, and you say there is the problems, let’s go solve them. Often things will occur while you are outside walking around, when you’ll see something, when you’ll talk to somebody or where you are maybe sometimes, actually an art exhibit will stimulate some thinking. A problem, obviously a problem, when you see problems, an example of a problem was when in 2002-03 when the US was about to go to war in Iraq. We were just marching, marching on as back WWI, Europeans will know the history from WWI, marching, sleepwalking in the history so to speak, and we were just marching along. It wasn’t 100 %, but it was pretty clear, and the question is, how costly this is going to be, and so I started working on the costs of the Iraq war, a pretty big study on that. But that was one where there is a problem just in front of you and you say: Well, how much is this going to cost, have we thought about the costs of this? Talk to people: Well, yes, it is not going to be very expensive, but of course, instead of 50 billion dollars, it’s like 2, 3, 4 trillion dollars – I’m just vastly, vastly underestimating. But that’s something where it is a problem.
Other times it’s just curiosity. An example of curiosity was I was thinking about light and whether we are measuring light correctly. It was just something I thought about and then I forgot about it, then thought about another year later, and then something would happen and I would see something and: Oh, that‘s how to do that. And then I got interested and worked intensively on it. So usually there’s, sometimes there’s a problem, sometimes just pure curiosity about something when you want to … was it measured correctly, and the lighting is a good example. With lighting, the background of lighting was it was a big controversy whether the price indexes were being measured correctly. This was particularly in the United States and there was a big report by a Stanford colleague named Mike Boskin, and the Boskin report, he argued that the consumer price index in the United States was seriously mis measured and that looked right. Part of the problem was we weren’t measuring quality change correctly, so that looks right. And I looked at some other price indexes, like the European price indexes are even worse that the US price indexes. So then at that point I said, what about light, are we measuring the price of light correctly, so at that point then I would say how we are going to measure, we can look at different sources, oil and electricity, compact fluorescence, that was before the LED bulb, and then you say we are measuring incorrectly because we are measuring them by the price of the light bulb, rather than how much it produces or certain number of lumen hours. I would say that was just pure curiosity that drove then.";815;Environment
How has the world interpreted your award?;I receive obviously as many Nobel Laureates do, a lot of e-mails, in these days e-mails, a few phone calls, a few letters and then personal congratulations from colleagues that I know in New Haven, friends. I think the most interesting thing about it is that this particular award for climate change, yes it’s economics, but people think this is an award for somebody who’s working on climate change. People think this is like a light in a dark time and they see this as very important institution, really the premier scientific award institution of the world, saying to the world and particular America, they are Americans, I think, particularly useful to Americans, to take heart, even if, I don’t think the Nobel, I don’t say you are saying, this is what they think you are saying, the people, and why they are so happy about it is because they think that you are saying take heart, there is good work out there, there are people who care about you, the United States and the rest of the world and just stay with it, keep heart and we have people who are working for good. So it was very interesting, and I think, I’m very grateful for that particularly, that it gives a kind of courage and heart to the people who are on the right side of history.;815;Impact of Nobel prize on you
You have previously said that, “the most important invention is the development of the city.” Why do you think this?;The reason the city was the most important invention is because cities facilitate cooperation. If we hadn’t invented cities, we wouldn’t be able to cooperate with large numbers of people like ourselves. It’s this potential for cooperation at scale that explains all of the success that humans have had. As the number of people goes up, the income per capita or resources per capita or standard of living that’s possible goes up. The challenge is to create the conditions where a large number of people can cooperate and all get the benefits from that. Cities let us do that at scale, starting from a hundred people up to nowadays 10 million or so.;816;Research
How do you think cities will develop in the future? What is important to take into consideration when making decisions about that evolution?;"It’s important to remember that there are people who will be affected by current decisions and elections who don’t have a vote – the people who will be born in the future. They’re affected by our decisions, but they don’t have a say. I think it’s useful to have that same kind of mentality about cities.
Most people, when they think about cities, think about the existing set of cities and how they will evolve. Part of what I’ve been trying to encourage everybody to think about is that new cities are still emerging and will continue to emerge. Probably the most important question we can ask about the future of the cities, is what’s the future for these new cities.";816;Research
Why are you so interested in the development of new, rather than existing cities?;"The future for existing cities is in some ways more boring because so many things are already established and would be very hard to change. But with new cities you have more freedom to try other kinds of arrangements. Also when most people then think about the future of a new city they assume that only rich people get to live there. But the new cities that matter are going to be the new cities that let people who have almost nothing move in and live and work there.
The reason I’m so focused on new cities that welcome people who come bringing just themselves is that this is a problem of enormous practical significance. This is not just a matter of science fiction or fantasy. According to the Gallup organisation, there are 750 million people around the world right now who say that they would move to a new country if there were some place that would accept them.
If you imagine new cities that could grow to 10 million people, which is not large by today’s standards, you’d need you need 75 of them to accommodate 750 million people. It’s not inconceivable that the world could develop 75 new cities like this, but it’s a pretty substantial undertaking.";816;Research
How could we develop 75 new cities that could accommodate that number of people?;Well how did we get the cities we already have? We got the cities that we have because the people who moved there used their talents and their labours to build them. So you need to have a vision of how the people who move to a new city start building it, but starting from ground zero.;816;Research
And what do you think these new cities would offer that our current cities couldn’t just by growing?;"First, they would accept many new residents. Most existing cities won’t do this. Second, what the successful cities would offer are the things that matter most to the people who want to move. You could have lots of different cities offering lots of different things, but the ones that succeed will be the ones that meet the demand that people have.
I suspect based on existing refugee and migration flows, that one of the most important things people are looking for is a place where they will be safe. The second thing that I think they want is a place where they can work – people are ambitious, they want to build things. And finally a place where they can stay for a long period of time, make longer term investments and that will offer opportunity for their children.";816;Research
You mentioned making decisions now for people who are not able to have a say, like those that are yet to be born. What do you think are the best things we can do with the cities we currently have to ensure a better future for incoming generations?;One of the things that I think all cities and all societies have to confront is the problem of inequality. The thing that first made me think about this idea of new cities was not international migration, but it was living in Chicago and getting to know a woman who lived in public housing there. She was a single mom with two children and I got to understand what it was like for her to live in conditions of high crime. The thing that struck me was that if you’re affluent, you can protect yourself from the threat of crime and the costs of crime. But when you have less income and fewer choices crime is an incredible burden. So these are the kinds of things that I hope, if there were more options of places people could move to, we would see better opportunities in terms of lower crime and better education opportunities.;816;Research
I just have one last question for you – what is your favourite city?;Maybe it’s because I lived there, but my favourite city now is New York. The thing I love about New York is that it was a gateway that welcomed millions of people who moved there from around the world. They brought nothing but themselves and got their first job in conditions that sometimes were not very attractive. But that was the first step that let them build a better lives for themselves and their children. New York is the demonstration that we can do this. It’s not a fantasy, we just have to do what we’ve done before.;816;Motivation
Did you ever think that you would get the call from Stockholm?;You are not really allowed to think about it, but one can always hope. A friend of mine told me that he had won a bet. In London I was going at 20 to 1 odds, so that suggests it could have happened.;817;The impact of nobel on you
What does this prize mean to you?;I think many Nobel Prize winners, especially in economics, were sort of stars the moment they arrived on the scene and might have been counting the days until this call came. That is not really the career I had. I was not a great student. My thesis advisor famously said that when interviewed about me, of my time in graduate school, that: “We did not expect much of him”. And you know the research that I won the prize for has been quite controversial from the beginning. I would say it’s becoming less controversial recently, so that is quite gratifying.;817;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What are you most looking forward to during Nobel Week?;I am having a dinner the night before the big day with all my friends. It is a little bigger that it might have been because there are a few young economists who somehow got invited so our dinner will 23.;817;Impact of Nobel on you
How does it feel to be called the ”father of behavioural economics”?;It is very gratifying. You know as most ideas there are, there’s more that one father. Adam Smith was a behavioural economist so he was there before me. As I argued in my recent book Misbehaving, economics was behavioural until about 1940. So Keynes would now be considered a behavioural economist. And then when economics started to become formalized and after World War two people like Paul Samuelson, and Ken Arrow, and Bob Solow … Not necessarily those people per se but the movement they started of writing down mathematical models. The easiest models to write down are ones of rational behaviour because you are just solving for the right answer. And then you are assuming that the people you are studying also get that answer. If you think about that, you realize that there is a bit of a flaw there, so you can have an economist work for three months to solve some very difficult problem and then just right assume that people maximize this formula that it took the world’s leading authority three months to solve. It might be that others would not solve it the same way.;817;Motivation
How do you tackle resistance?;I always felt that the answers to these debates has to be data. You can’t win arguments and you also can’t really change anybody’s mind. So for people who had made their minds up – so be it. I concentrated on young people and the young people that found these ideas exciting are really what has made the field thrive the way it has the last couple of decades.;817;Creativity
How did your interest in behavioural economics start?;"My interest started before I knew anything about psychology. I just noticed when I was in graduate school that people would do things that seemed inconsistent with the theories that I was learning. There is a story I tell about a friend of mine and I were given tickets to a professional basketball game about an hour’s drive away in normal times and then there was a big snow storm and my friend said: “There is no way we are driving in this snow, but if we had paid for those tickets then we would be going”. This is what economists called the sunk cost fallacy. The idea is that, suppose we had paid full price for those tickets whatever that might have been at that time, let’s say we were out 50 bucks each, that money is gone, there is no way to get it back. It’s sunk and you can read in any economic principles book that you should ignore sunk costs and that you should and that people do. And what I was seeing in stories like that was, people don’t. And in fact we have to teach people when they take economics for the first time, no, that is a sunk cost, you should not pay attention to that. So I started a list of funny things people do and that’s all it was for two or three years.
Then I met two psychologists in 1975 I think this was, who introduced me to the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, psychologists who were then teaching at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. I had told that this psychologist’s name is Bob Fischhoff who had been a student of theirs and I told them about what I had been thinking about and he said: “You know you might be interested in the research that my thesis advisors have done”. And so when I got home I went to the library as one did in the 70s. There were actually books and journals, dusty ones. I had to go search for the psychology section of the library which was a whole new thing for me, and I started reading these papers and getting very excited and it is not that their research had anything to do with economics. Later they wrote a paper called Prospect theory that was aimed at economists but this early work in the early 70s had nothing to do with economics, but it had one idea, one central idea which was not only do people make mistakes, but that the mistakes they make are predictable. The reason why that was important was up until that time when I would bring these kinds of things up, economists would say: “Look, we know people make mistakes but those will wash out and we can handle mistakes”. But if the mistakes are all in the same direction or mostly in the same direction then it is a bigger problem for economics.
So I began to rethink some of the things on my blackboard. For example, one of the things I was interested in was the not very remarkable idea that people have self-control problems. To anyone but an economist this does not seem to be a deep observation. It is in the Bible, so it has been around for a long time. There is the story of Odysseus tying himself to the mast so we are up to ancient greeks. This is not a new idea. Thaler discovers self-control problems! Everybody knows that but there is an assumption in economics that comes with the fancy term consumer sovereignty. What consumer sovereignty means is that no one can know better than you what’s best for you. There are two parts to that. One is you are capable of making rational decisions and two, that you know your tastes. And then maybe there is the third one which is that you will then act on those preferences. We know say 20% of the population is obese, many people are smokers. If you ask them: “Would you rather not be a smoker?” they would say: “Yes I have tried to quit 20 times”, so people do have self-control problems and what is this matter for economics? One of the problems people have to face is saving for retirement and that is a problem that is a cognitively very difficult. Figuring out somebody your age trying to think how much they are going to make over their lifetime and then how long they are going to live and what kinds of rates of return they are going to get: that is hard! And then even if you could solve that, there is that very cute sports car that is begging you to buy it and you know it is not really consistent with this long run plan, but you are only young once, so these self-control problems are important to understand.";817;Motivation
How long have you known your fellow laureate Daniel Kahneman?;"After meeting my friend Fischhoff who told me about their work I heard they were going to – they being Kahneman and Tversky – were going to spend a year at Stanford 1977-78, so it is exactly 40 years. I decided I was going to somehow figure out a way to go spend a year at Stanford too. So I went sometime in the spring for a few days and went around to various people and begged and pleaded, and finally a guy called Victor Fuchs took pity on me and set me up with the fellowship so I ended up spending that year there in an office very nearby to where Danny Kahneman was sitting and got to know both of them. Then we all took new jobs at the end of that year. Amos did at Stanford, Danny went to University of British Columbia, I went to Cornell and that meant we were all on the same sabbatical schedule.
Seven years later I had a sabbatic coming up and I had had this great year visiting Amos and Danny and decided I would try to do the same thing. Danny was staying in Vancouver for his sabbatic. His wife Anne Treisman’s daughter was going to still be in high school so they were sticking around for her. So I decided: “Danny, would you like a visitor for a year?” and I went and spent another year with him and we wrote two very important papers in this field that year. It probably helps that I am an optimist because Danny is a pessimist. He claims to be a rational pessimist. So you know, in one of their theorises is that losses hurt more than gains, so he says if he expects the worst then he won’t experience any negative surprises. But being a pessimist is a really dumb idea. I have been trying to convince him of that unsuccessfully for forty years. But I think I served the job of cheering him up and telling him maybe things aren’t as bad as all that. This is getting to be more and more difficult in the times we are currently living in. But somehow miraculously we have stayed friends all these years. We have had a third year, we spent together seven years after that in New York City and now we still talk very frequently.";817;Creativity
What is the greatest impact of your work?;"At an abstract level I think the work has given economists permission to think about models that are not perfectly rational and to say this is a legitimate exercise. Creating that legitimacy required doing research in a wide variety of areas. I started studying financial markets and the reason is that economists were certain that you could not find any evidence of what I call misbehaviour in financial markets because the stakes are so high and you have all these professional traders. A friend of mine … you know the Frank Sinatra song New York, New York: “If you can make it there you can make it anywhere”, and he used to refer to my efforts in finances, the New York, New York theory, that if I could find anomalies in financial markets then that would carry the day. So 1985 I had a student who wanted to do research in finance and we wrote a paper together called Does the stock market overreact?. The answer is yes, and that paper caused a big stir in financial economics which encouraged me to write more of those papers and since then I have done research on anything from game shows to American football to laboratory experiments with people playing games and then a large part of my work has been in studying saving behaviour and how to help people save more.
Pensions, first of all pensions are new for human beings. For most of the millions of years we have been on earth saving for our retirement was not anything to worry about because you were going to die first and if you manage to live then you would move in with your kids. So pensions are kind of a 20th century invention. And the first ones were these so-called defined benefit pension schemes, that you worked at your company and then they would give you an annuity when you retired that was based just on what you made and how long you worked. No decisions to make. And then companies realized that those pensions were very expensive and started switching over to the so called defined contribution plans where companies and workers both contribute to a pot of money and then it is up to the worker how much to save, how to invest it, then how to draw it down and that is a really hard problem. I have worked with co-authors especially another of my students Shlomo Benartzi. We have worked on trying to make that problem easier for people. I have been working with companies and countries in devising retirement savings plans that are easy for humans.
One of the first innovations was something called automatic enrolment. It used to be in order to join the plan you would have to fill out a big pile of forms. People do not like filling out forms so many people would just fail to join even if their company or their government was giving a match. So we had the idea of making enrolment automatic, so changing the default, so when you first became eligible for a pensions plan you would get a pile of forms and instead of having to fill them all out the first page would say: “If you do not fill out all these forms we are going to enrol you at this saving rate and in this fund”. That’s become very popular and as you no doubt know was used in a recent pension reform in the UK. Essentially a national defined contribution retirement saving plan and it employed automatic enrolment and signups have been over 90%. So there was great scepticism. Lord Adair Turner was responsible for this reform and he decided to go with this idea and people did not think it would work but it worked. Then the second idea Benartzi and I had is what we call Save More Tomorrow. And the idea there is that we all have more self-control in the future. We are planning diets after New Year’s, so our idea was to give people the opportunity to commit themselves to increase their saving sometime in the future like. Like when they get the next raise and we linked it to raises because of loss aversion so they would not see their pay go down just it would go up a little less. And then there is a lot of inertia in these plans so once you joined this Save More Tomorrow plan it would keep ratcheting up until you hit your goal and it took us years to get somebody to try this, but finally found one company in Chicago to try it and we tripled saving rates in three years and then wrote a paper about it and now in the US among large companies the vast majority use automatic enrolment and automatic escalation, which is the generic term for Save More Tomorrow.";817;Creativity
Can you describe the idea behind a ”nudge”?;The idea of a nudge is that you can point somebody in a helpful direction without forcing them to do anything. So that is the definition of a nudge. It is some feature of the environment that improves decisions but doesn’t force anybody to do anything. One of my favourite examples, one that has saved my life on numerous occasions, are those helpful signs “Look right” when you are crossing the street in London. You know, you drive on the wrong side of the road there. I wish you would do something about that. But given that you are not, it helps to warn people that those double decker buses come the wrong way. Oh yes, it is coming from over here! So that is a nudge! People get confused about this. They think that nudging is kind of a nanny state that the government is trying to get people to do what the government wants. You know the “Look right” sign, yes. the government would rather you did not kill yourself and it will cause a bit of a mess, but you do not want to get hit by that bus. And we are very clear that the goal of nudging has helped, helping people achieve their own goals. I’d like to think of GPS as a good analogy. I have the worst sense of direction of anybody. If I am not with my wife I am certain to get lost. But now I have Google maps on my phone and even wandering around the West End of London I do not get lost too much. The thing about a GPS system is you pick the destination. I want to go to the British Museum, I plug that in and it says “Turn right” and furthermore the instructions are not mandatory. If I see something interesting over to the left I can go to the left. The Apple recompute that, that’s our goal. To be the GPS for life and we do not want to tell people where they should go.;817;Research
You have joked that you’ll spend the prize money as ”irrationally as possible”.;I should say that I made this comment at 4.45 am. Well, I do not have the money yet so I have not lived up to that promise. I do intend to throw a good party Saturday night and then try to spend it to make as many people happy as possible.;817;free time
What’s your story?;What’s my story? What brought me to this scientific field? A lot of luck, a lot of accidents. I certainly didn’t start out to study economics. I think, you know, when I was in high school I studied mathematics because it was relatively easy and it gave me a lot of free time to do things I liked to do, which is play rugby, listen to music and play the organ and things like that. But when I got to Cambridge I discovered that mathematics was a little more serious than I wanted it to be so I became an economist, more or less by accident, and I loved it from the beginning. I think I have been curious ever since I was a kid, I just wandered through economics finding things out.;820;Motivation
Has luck played a role in your life?;I think you say it right, how do I think about luck and why is it so central in the way I think about it? I think it has been central in my life and what happened to me and my family, but it has also played a big part in my work so that I could talk a little bit about both of those. My father grew up in coal-mining village in England and he would have still been there if the luck of the second world war had not drafted him into the army. It’s a funny sort of luck, but it worked out well for him and then he was going to go on a raid, a commando raid in the army in Norway in which everyone was killed and he didn’t go because he had the luck to get tuberculosis. There are two big pieces of luck without which I would not have been born in the first place and I almost think people who are successful tend to understate just how important luck is and what happens to them. I think generally we tend to underestimate how important luck is in our lives, especially those of us who are successful and also in my work I have tended to focus on one of the things that’s a very … I think a lot about inequality for instance. One of the forces that’s very important in generating inequality is just luck. If you and I start out with exactly the same amount of money or talent or education and then we are just bombarded by, you know, you get out of bed on one side in the morning, I get out of the bed on the other side in the morning. After a few years we are very different and that is just the cumulated facts of luck and I think that’s a force in life over time that’s creating a lot of inequality.;820;Creativity
Describe your Nobel Prize-awarded work in one minute;I have to describe my Nobel Prize-winning work in one minute. Wow, I have been trying to concentrate the time to 30 minutes for my talk on Tuesday, but one minute is much more of a challenge. I think I have spent a lot of my life trying to understand how people behave and why they behave the way they behave. Some of that is the classic problems of economics, which is if market prices change, how do people respond to those market prices and people have been studying that in economics for 200 years at least, maybe 300 years, a long time anyway. I find maybe better ways of doing that, this is a classic subject in economics so people worked on it for a long time, so I am not going to change everything, but maybe I made a little few improvements here and there. I also tried to study. When you look at how people behave you can say something about whether they are becoming better off or worse off, and I am always being concerned with human wellbeing or a human welfare and how that relates to the way that people behave in markets. That’s what I really do and that’s what the prize was about. Less than a minute.;820;Research
When do you do your best thinking?;It’s hard to tell, I do quite a lot of thinking when I am asleep, I think. You wake up in the morning with a solution to something you didn’t know. Or worse, and maybe more frequent, you go to bed thinking of a solution and you wake up in the morning realising it’s not a solution. But I love to go fishing and I have loved to go fishing since I was a kid and you spent time in Scotland, and you know how people like to go fly fishing for trout. Even a poor kid in Scotland can do that, you don’t need a lot of money to do that. I used to go fly fishing for trout and when I was fly fishing for trout I would … It’s a very strange experience because it’s a totally absorbing activity. I would go fly fishing and I would come home in the evening and my mother would ask “How was your lunch?” and I would say “I forgot to eat it” and she said “You have been out there for 12 hours, how could you forget to eat your lunch?” and I said “I was so busy fishing.” But at the same time I was thinking about things and once again it’s sort of like being asleep. I come home from fishing and maybe I would have solved something or I had thought of some new way of doing something or some new way into some problem and I still do that. Anne and I go fishing together a lot and, you know, we think about things.;820;Environment
What does intelligence mean to you?;I don’t know, I’m not prepared for that question at all. It’s interesting because when you are a kid you’re always being tested for intelligence or that sort of things, so you think of intelligence as getting the highest score on an IQ test or something. It’s always been the case for me that I have certainly never been the most intelligent kid around. When I was younger I used to be very envious of people who were much quicker than I was. I think as I have gotten older I have understood that intelligence is important, but certainly it may not even be the most important thing. Curiosity is tremendously important. We talk in our profession a lot about what we call bearing down and that means that when you have a problem you don’t run away from it. You just try very hard to find out what that problem is about and get a solution or something like that. Bearing down is I think a very very important part of academic success. Intelligence I think is important, but only one of many things, because we see students all the time who are just smarter than anything you have ever seen. If you teach at a place like Princeton you see undergraduates who would completely break your IQ scale or whatever, and some of them are very successful, but most of them are not. Who knows, you need a lot of other things.;820;Competencies
Who was your most inspiring teacher?;I never took a course in economics and I never went to classes in economics, but I had people that I tried to imitate. There were people I wanted to be like and people I much much admired and some of those were people I knew, some of those were people whose work I read and I wanted to be able to write things like that. But the one I knew the best that I wanted to be most like and who used to wear bow ties like me and I really imitated all my life is Richard Stone who got the Nobel Prize in 1984. I knew him very well and very early in my career, when I was just a research assistant, he saw something in me that he thought was like him and so he always used to say, “You and I are on the same side of the movement.” I never quite knew what that meant but I loved it. It was just wonderful to be told that. I always wanted to be like him and I have achieved some of those things. He would have been very happy to see me getting this award, after many … 31 years after him.;820;Mentors (Role models)
What’s the biggest challenge facing the world today?;Part of the problem there is just picking which of the many things that really threaten us, but one of the things … I wrote a book a couple of years ago called The Great Escape. I am answering this question in a somewhat circuitousway. We all read the newspapers every day and the newspapers are full of terrible things, and the newspapers are full of all these threats. We have the threat from global warming, which has come up in past, we have the threat of the destruction of the eurozone from migration pressures or from financial pressures. There are terrible threats out there that we don’t always appreciated like the threat of antimicrobial resistance for instance, which I think is a very serious threat. The reason I came back to my book is because amidst all those threats we don’t realise in some ways how well we have done and just how much better the world is now than it was 250 years ago, how much better the world is now than it was 50 years ago. I was born in Edinburgh in 1945, the infant mortality rate in 1945 was higher than it is in India today. When my father was born in the Yorkshire coalfields in 1918 the infant mortality rate in England was about as same as it in Sub-Saharan Africa today and we think of Sub-Saharan Africa as being so far behind us in terms of health and wellbeing, but it’s not so long ago since we were there. We have made an enormous amount of progress, so when you think of these threats we should see these threats in context as threats to the progress we have made rather than sort of an existential threats, though some of them, like global warming, could of course be existential threats, but there is an awful lot out there that threatens us.;820;Creativity
What advice would you give your 20-year-old self?;Oh, I don’t know, what advice would I give to my 20-year-old self? I think I would tell him not to worry as much as I did when I was 20 years old, things will come out alright in the end and to do what is fun to do, to follow your curiosity. I was always worried that I didn’t know what I wanted to do and even when I was a little kid when people said “What do you want to do?” and I said “I want to be an engine driver” and after you stopped being an engine driver you never knew where I was going to be after that. I certainly didn’t know I was going to be an economist, but it worked out well in the end and I thought within economics that I was too scattered and worked on too many different things so when this prize was announced it was almost as if the committee had discovered the pattern of my life’s work in a way that I didn’t know it was. I think, tell the 20-year olds to follow what you are good at, to follow your curiosity and let the rest of things look after themselves. You can’t control it, you got to let it come.;820;Advice for young scientists
What’s the toughest challenges you’ve faced? How did you overcome it?;Oh, I don’t know, what’s the toughest challenge I have faced in life? I don’t know, like everybody else there have been personal challenges that have been very hard to overcome. I am not sure that I want to talk about those very publicly, but I think for all of us, everybody, again if I am addressing young people who are thinking about going into scientific careers certainly won’t absolve you of all the bad things that will happen in life and you know we all have a common humanity which means there are bad things and wonderful things which will happen to us too. You just have to trust and live them through.;820;Creativity
Could you please explain your Nobel Prize awarded work in simple terms?;My work, which has been awarded the prize, is on the regulation of industries. The regulations of industries include what we call anti-trust which mean that churches and courts and anti-trust authorities check on behaviour of large firms, to check there is no abuse of a dominant position so that the large firms don’t abuse their power. It also includes regulation, regulation of what’s called network industries, so the telecom industry, electricity industry, railroad, post offices and also a little bit of regulation of banks which of course has been a very typical issue lately.;821;Research
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;I am not sure that my work is a breakthrough. I have done a lot of different pieces of work because this field actually is very diverse and very rich. Two industries are not the same, all industries are different. For example, the payment card industry when you use your Visa or American Express card doesn’t work at all like Google or doesn’t work at all like the cement industry or the telecoms industry – they are all different so we have to build a number of series and /---/ work so as to understand those industries better. So it is more like a accumulation of work, not only by me but also by my colleagues and the entire profession which has made it easier for regulators and competition policy, for central banks, for regulators to deal with those large firms, but I don’t think there is really a breakthrough, it is more like an accumulation of different contributions by me and many other people.;821;Creativity
What brought you to science?;What attracted me about economic sciences, well, when I was a student, I didn’t study economics to start with. When I was in high school, I liked mathematics because it is very challenging and intrigued and then I liked social sciences, but I didn’t know anything about economics, I liked history, I liked psychology. And then when I was 21, I was studying engineering and mathematics, I discovered economics and I loved economics because it basically combined the rigour of mathematics and this human aspect of social sciences so then I decided to do some economics and I went for PhD at MIT in the US, but it was very late actually, I discovered economics.;821;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;I have a lot of role models. My adviser of course, Eric Maskin, who got the Nobel Prize in 2007, he is a fantastic researcher but also a wonderful person, human being. And Jean-Jacques Laffont actually was my mentor. He started the old school in Toulouse, he was a great scientist, but instead of being at a top university in the US, he decided to be in Toulouse in France and to build something. He was a very dear friend. He passed away in 2004, he was a very dear friend. I learned a lot from him, both in terms of work but also, just like with Eric Maskin, as a human being. And of course, there are lots of other mentors, Paul Samuelson, Ken Arrow – you know, all the great economists and many others as well, you know, standing on the shoulders of science as Newton used to say.;821;Mentors (Role models)
What were you doing when you heard you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;It was strange, I was working with a collaborator with a grand proposal for the European Research Council and I was not expecting the prize, so I didn’t hear the phone. It was on the vibrating mode. So, the committee actually tried to call, and I understand they tried to call my secretary as well and so on and so forth. And at the end I heard the phone, it was vibrating on my desk and I took the phone. The number was +46, so I said: “Uh-oh”. I was very surprised and that was wonderful news.;821;Impact of Nobel on you
Could you explain your awarded work for young students?;If I would explain my work, I started back in 1962 working on the general topic is how do prices incorporate new information. It’s called the efficient markets hypothesis, but that’s it basically, how do prices incorporate new information. I devised a lot of tests about how you go about doing that, that’s one branch of asset pricing for which the award was given. The other one is what we call the asset pricing models which are really stories about how you measure risk and then what is the relation between risk and expected return, so they are basically risk return story. Those are kind of the two main branches of asset pricing which I have been working on for the last 53 years.;822;Meaning(Values) of Work
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences?;It was 6 o’clock in the morning so I was doing my back exercises which I do every morning pretty much. I was preparing a class because I had a class later that day, at 9 o’clock actually. Of course, I was surprised by the call, lots of people could get the prize, I was surprised, it was a pleasant surprise. I was kind of chocked, I went in to talk to my wife, I wanted to tell my wife and I told her “Well, you are going to have to go to Sweden” and she said “What for?” and I said “Because I got the Nobel Prize” and she said “No” and I said “Yes”. She said “No”, because the phone didn’t ring in her room, so she didn’t hear it. She thought I was putting her on, but in the end, she started crying.;822;Impact of the Nobel on you
What brought you to Economic Sciences?;I started out studying French, I was going to be a French teacher and a sports coach. When I was very young I was very good a sports, my high school’s athletic hall of fame, so I thought that’s what I was going to be. Then I started to get tired of studying languages and I took an economics course and it was a revelation, so that’s what I have been doing ever since. What I tell young people now is “Don’t think you know what you want to do”, because you don’t know all the opportunities that are out there. You have to have a range of experiences before you choose what you really want to do and you better choose something you like because you are going to spend a lot of time at it. If you enjoy it, it makes your life a lot easier and more pleasurable and more satisfying than if you don’t enjoy it.;822;Motivation
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;From very early on, because there wasn’t anything new, everything was a breakthrough, so it was kind of easy in those days to do new stuff. Nowadays the young people coming along have it much harder because there is huge body of work they have to be familiar with. I didn’t have to be familiar with anything except basic economics and statistics in order to proceed with my work. At that time, the reason it all started at that time is kind of silly because what started it was the fact that computers came and computers made it easy for people to do work with data, that was very difficult to do before that. They had to use these old mechanical calculators that the people watching this have probably never seen in their lifetime. It was very difficult to do things accurately even. Then computers came and they were not as powerful as your cellphone is now, but they were a revelation at that time. All kinds of people got interested in doing work with computers and stock prices are one of the most easily available data that you can get so lots of people started to work on stock prices and returns and that’s where I started too.;822;Creativity
Who is your role model, and why?;My professor, I had two main professors when I was a student, one was Merton Miller, he was a Nobel Prize winner, another one was Harry Roberts, he was a statistician and those two people were my inspiration. I didn’t learn anything in classes at that time. When I started writing my thesis, that’s when I started to really take things into my memory and to work with them and keep them there. Basically, it was one-on-one work with these two people that did it. I was married at 19 and we had one child and one child on the way so that was inspiration, I wanted to finish my thesis pretty quickly so I could get a job.;822;Mentors (Role models)
Can you tell us a little about your work in finance?;I started before finance was even a real discipline so there wasn’t anything, there weren’t any journals in finance or anything like that, everything was new at that time. It took a while initially before it made its way into practice, but then it was kind of like an explosion, waterfall. It took maybe ten or fifteen years before initially the applied world, the investment world, came around to the new way of thinking, but then when they did, now it’s basically instant so they are looking over our shoulders all the time and now to see what is going on, and see how they can incorporate it into their products. Finance is really very applied as a discipline, the research gets applied very quickly if it works, if it has anything to say.;822;Dealing with difficulties
Could you describe your awarded work for young students?;The way that I like to describe my work is that it’s developing statistical methods to do something without having to do everything. Let me elaborate a little bit on that. I am particular interested in these linkages between the overall macroeconomy and financial markets. One could imagine that to do this with a model you’ve got to have a detailed model of the macroeconomy, you’ve got to have a detailed, inside that a detailed model of the how financial markets work inside that economy in order to get off the ground and it’s very handy to instead just be able to do pieces of that without having to do the whole thing simultaneously. The methods that I developed were aimed being able to understand that piece without having to have a full-blown model of both, financial markets and the entire economy. Eventually one has to put all pieces together, but it is nice to be able to look at a portion of it and then want to come back and add much more details along this various different dimensions.;823;Meaning(Values) of Work
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences?;I am an early raiser and there’s two tasks I had that morning. The first was we had recently purchased a puppy so shortly after five o’clock that morning I took the dog out for a walk and then because I regularly exercise shortly after six o’clock I was in between taking the dog for a walk, came back, was just thinking about getting ready to go out and exercise. At that point in time the phone call came in – is this really happening? – so the first was, well the first indication that this was a call from Stockholm and the second person conveyed to be the message about the award. I started to believe it when the third person got on, the third person was someone who I knew for several years, Torsten Persson, and when he came on and congratulated me and I said: “Wow, I guess this is just really happening”. My wife could kind of sense that something was happening, she was in the kitchen so she quickly came out of the kitchen and witnessed this and figured it out.;823;Impact of the Nobel on you
What brought you to Economic Sciences?;When I went to college I did a lot of experimentation across various different subjects. Early on I was a chemistry major, but I wasn’t very into doing lab work. I was actually working inside a chemistry laboratory and I just decided that probably wasn’t what I wanted to be doing. I became interested in the social sciences and I became very interested in the mathematics also at the same time. I explored political science, but by the junior year of collage I convinced myself that economics would be a good place for me to put together my interests in both social problems and economics and statistics.;823;Motivation
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;I worked on statistical methods and then I was very lucky early on in my carrier to have some great collaborators and some work that I did with Ken Singleton started getting a lot of attention and I guess at that point in time was the first time I had some feeling that this is an important research agenda. Maybe it was 1985 when Ken Singleton and I were given the Frisch prize. Ragnar Frisch was the first Nobel Laureate in Economics, /- – -/so it is called the Frisch prize and so on. At a fairly young age I was able to share that, I guess that was an indicator that the work was getting some attention. I remember being very much kind of enthusiastic and excited by the research, but it was very hard to tell which portions of the research were going to command the biggest attention. In fact even now when I work on research project, sometimes they get very low attention and sometimes they get a lot and while I am doing it, it is not always so easy to tell which of the ones will have the bigger influence.;823;Creativity
What message you would like to confer to the young people?;The one thing that was important to me was the fact that the education system was very tolerant of a late bloomer. In high school I would bring home so-called checkmarks for “does not respect authority” and I was not a very … my performance in high school was erratic. Certain teachers picked up on the fact that I had some talent, but I was not … I did not perform particularly well. The university that I went to happened to be the one where my dad was provost, but it’s a local university and that admits a large number of people. Just being able to go to a university, having some key-faculty members identify you as a person that might have some count and interest and then invest in and kind of allowing me as a late bloomer to still engage and embark in a career was tremendously important, so I guess the message would be first of all don’t give up on yourself early on and it’s good to be in environments that can tolerate late bloomers.;823;Advice for young scientists
Can you tell us a little about the University of Chicago?;Chicago is a very intense environment, I tell lots of people that, I don’t go to work looking for compliments because we are very critical of each other’s work and so. But there is a notion that economics is to be taken very seriously and it’s to be addressing important problems. It’s supposed to be rigorous and at same time relevant. That intensity, I think, has been very important for that environment and it dominates lots of interactions and I think it’s really been part of the reason Chicago as an economics department or as an economics community has been so productive. Economics is a field that advances and as it advances it necessarily gets more specialized. Chicago has been very good at resisting too much specialization. There is lots of interaction across areas and the like that I think can really be important for a creative research.;823;Life
Could you please explain your Prize awarded work for 13-14-year olds?;I was part of a three-man award. It’s a little hard because I think that the descriptions they might give will be different than mine, so I have to speak for all three of us. I think it has something to do … it’s hard for a thirteen-year-old, well, a thirteen or a fourteen-year-old would know about something called the stock market or the housing market. We have done work on understanding what drives these markets and why do they move through time, what patterns can you expect them to show? Looking at from my perspective I was always among the three of us the one that was most sceptical about rationality of human behaviour. Basically, these markets can go crazy sometimes and that was my view and it coloured the kind of work that I did. I don’t know that I proved that markets go crazy, but I think that the evidence that I showed inclines really in that direction.;824;Meaning(Values) of Work
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Prize?;I was getting out of the shower at home, I was dripping and the phone called and I was thinking, maybe I just won’t answer that, but then I thought, I had a suspicion I did answer it and it was quite a surprise. Then I woke my wife up and I said, I apologized to her, I said: “I don’t know if I should wake you for this but I just won the Nobel Prize” and she said: You are kidding!”. I had people telling me that I might win it, but they are friends of mine, so I then decided I will ask other economists, well-known economists: “Do you have friends telling you that you are going to win the Nobel Prize?” and they always said: “Yes”, so I figured it meant nothing that I have friends telling me that.;824;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What brought you to Economic Sciences?;When I was a child, I thought I wanted to be a scientist, I could have been in chemistry or physics or medicine. At some point in my college years I decided to switch to economics when I was in a junior in college. Why did I make the switch? I don’t exactly know. What struck me is that the choices young people have make about careers, there is so many things you can do, but you are expected to commit at a very early age to one line or another. I think it is part of the tragedies of ordinary living that you have do that. I would love to be all of those things, a chemist, a physicist, the medical researcher and how about a writer as well, but in reality you can’t do all of those things and you never know, you make a choice in life, you never know at the end whether it was correct.;824;Motivation
Have you ever had an eureka moment?;"There were times in my research that I thought that I might have something important and I don’t think that I was thinking I would win the Nobel Prize for it though.
Robert J. Shiller: Thinking about the importance of my work and especially in preparing for my Nobel Lecture I am struck at how many different people did important work and often they are forgotten, not completely forgotten, but largely forgotten. I am inclined to reflect that the Nobel Prize is quite a rare event. It is not enough to do good work, it has to somehow be really highly regarded. I just feel that there are so many other people who are highly deserving, I feel humbled by the thought of that.";824;Creativity
Who is your role model, and why?;At various times in my upbringing and in my carrier I have had role models that inspired me. It goes back to my high-school math teacher who inspired me to think that I could do mathematics and then in college I had a professor who was combining psychology and economics. I thought that is really solid, it sounded very real to me. Then in graduate school I had an adviser who connected me, made my economic work connected to real problems in the world and then over the years I have had others, there are lots. My wife has been an inspiration to me too, my wife is a psychologist and that has helped mould my thinking.;824;Mentors (Role models)
What is the importance of the Nobel Prize?;What I like about the Nobel Prize … I was thinking of all the prizes that are given out, a lot of them are related to sports, the arts and often like movies. What strikes me as unique about the Nobel Prize is that it’s really high-minded, that’s why I am feeling very honoured to get it, but it’s for people who are contributing to our intellectual capital in the world. I particularly like the idea that we have a prize in chemistry. I am not a chemist, so I have no reason to say this, but I think we don’t give enough attention to our chemists. They are really important, and I just so much admire what they do. I am glad that somebody has this award for them and for the other scientist as well.;824;Impact of Nobel on you
I think when I phoned you both in October you were both somewhat surprised by the name, it’s a bit of a liability on that day of the announcement. How have the couple of months since the announcements been for you?;"Oliver Williamson: In a word – hectic.
Elinor Ostrom: And two words – very hectic.
You must be catapulted into a spotlight and a world of activity.
Oliver Williamson: It is, one of the things that is really gratifying however is how much goodwill you soak out from hearing from friends, former students, colleagues and family. It’s unreal but it’s there and so genuine that I couldn’t have imagine it.
That is nice.
Elinor Ostrom: I double that, some parts of the e-mail load are not friends and family and trying to cope with that has been a bit of a challenge. For our former students and colleagues all over the world, they have been sending joyous messages and that is very gratifying.";832;Creativity
And since you are the first woman to have been awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in its 40-year history I imagine that is slightly added to the load you have been under.;"Elinor Ostrom: Yes, I think that there have been many people who have been particularly asking about gender problems in American universities. Universities more general, it’s not just US.
I am sorry, you must be terrible bored of discussing this, but the fact that there has been one in 40 years, do you think that is in any way representative of the female contribution to economics over the last 40 years?
Elinor Ostrom: Not the contribution, but the capability to be in academia.
Do you see things improving?
Elinor Ostrom: Yes, I think that many departments now have new graduate students coming in at a rate, new women graduate students that they did not have previously, and our departments are moving toward hiring more. I don’t think I will be the last.
Do you see a change in the Nobel women coming to the subject?
Oliver Williamson: Oh yes, yes, and as Lin suggests, many are really excellent, and they get good placements and they are doing good work and we are going to hear from them.
Elinor Ostrom: Yes!";832;The impact of nobel on you
So the prize this year is divided into two parts, but you are united in your work by the phrase the committee used such as ‘economic governance’ and broadly you both study ways of regulating transactions in the broader sense. If I could start with you, you study complex economic organizations and complex transactions and one part of your work that has been particularly sort of commented on by the committee is the fact that that allows you to say something about what sort of transactions should be conducted within firms and what sort of transactions should be conducted within a market.;"Oliver Williamson: Yes!
Can you give examples of the sort of transaction that we are talking about when we say that?
Oliver Williamson: Yes, but I wonder if I could back off for a minute and talk about governance, because there is a compact two-sentence statement that was made by John R. Commons who was an older stylist, institutional economist, and I think undervalued by a lot of people then and since but never the less profound in many of his insights. And the two-sentence statement runs roughly as follows: “The principal unit of analysis should contain in itself, the three principles of conflict, mutuality and order. This unit is a transaction”. The part of it that I initially related to, because I was working at this more microanalytic level of transactions rather than completed goods and services, was that the transactions /- – -/ analysis. But as I got deeper into the study of organization, I started to ask what is the value added for some of these more complex forms of organization.
This triple of conflict, mutuality and order goes right to the essence and specifically I would describe governance as the means by which to infuse order thereby a medicate conflict and realize mutual games and that was contemplated, I would say, by Commons, even though he didn’t have much success in implementing it. That’s a profound sense of what I think was a missing arena for economics for a long time. A specific example would be the first project that I undertook along these lines and that’s the make-or-buy decision that firms was confronted with, it needs a specialized component let us say. It can either outsource to a independent contractor and mediate that transaction with a written contract that stipulates what’s to be delivered when, why and how they are going to handle difficulties in the like or you can take that transaction out of the market and organize it internally which is the make decision and vertical integrations issues had been around for a long time, addressed mainly as a technological issue addressing it in contractual terms with reference to two alternatives that one might have an advantage over the other or not. But the challenge was to first look at it contractually actually compartive contractually because you always want to think of two or more alternative ways of getting it done and then thirdly one other fact is that to drive it around in one way or another. And working that through was the transaction cost’s economics challenge.";832;Creativity
I can see that you can analyze a situation in which a firm is saying should we have this component made outside, buy it in or should we make it ourselves? But you have been able to turn that into theories which suggest in which circumstances the make decision is correct, which circumstances the buy decision is correct and then those theories have been put out to empirical testing and they presumably refine the theory. Is it now, are you able to suggest principles by which firms can govern their decision to the make-or-buy decision?;"Oliver Williamson: What you need to do is you need to identify the critical attributes that define transactions so that operationalizing that the concept of transaction by naming what you take to be the critical factors across which transactions cost will vary. Then secondly you need to do the same thing with reference to governance structures, you need to identity the critical dimensions with respect to which governance structures differ. Then you ask the question given this cluster of attributes of transactions. Do they pose easy or complicated kinds of contractual issues? If they are easy, there are lots of easy transactions, I mean this is what spot markets and so are all about, neither party has any kind of dependency relation on the other. It’s sort of the classical problem of exchanging nuts for berries at the edge of the forest, you know. We both benefit from the exchange, but we don’t have any continuing relationship. Where you have to have a continuing relationship, where one party needs to make specialized investments in support of the other and where this contract may break down if it’s done in an intra-firm fashion, that’s where the concept of taking transactions out of the market and organizing them internally is important.
And actually, there is two other sort of major figures that I would say that enter into this and one is, both of them talk about adaptation as being the central problem of economic organization. One of these people is an organization theorist also from the 1930s, namely Chester Barnard, and he was interested in what it was distinctive that was going on within firms and his fear was that coordinated adaptation was the central kind of a contribution that internal organization had to bring and during that in a conscious deliberate purposeful way. This was, I would say, the marvel of internal organization, all was bureaucracy then and since it has been widely scorned. Sometimes for good reasons, but nevertheless there are things that internal organizations are especially good at. The other person was Friedrich Hayek, former Nobel Prize winner, that emphasized autonomous adaptations accomplished to the market in response to changes of relative prizes. This was the marvel of the market as economists had long regarded it but as Hayek specifically nailed it. Well, we have two marvels actually, the marvel of the market and the marvel of hierarchy and we had to appreciate both of them, and we had to know the strength and weaknesses of both of them and that’s part of the exercise.";832;Creativity
Is this very much an area of on-going study? Do we know the strength and weaknesses of the firm versus the market or is this just something that is going to continue to evolve as firms evolve and the world becomes more global and all of this?;"Oliver Williamson: Well,I don’t think this exercise is over, but I do think that we have made headway and an appreciation for firms and it goes beyond firms and markets, I mean there is also a place for bureaus, theres’s a place for cooperatives. There are lots of challenges that haven’t yet been uncovered and some that have that need to be more fully refined. But one other thing that I would also say, and that is that beyond intermediate product market transactions or close approximations theretoo, any issue that you can, that either arises as or can be reformulated in contracting terms is an issue that you can get some deeper insights by addressing it in transaction cost economizing terms. That isn’t to say that’s the only ones to bring to bear, but it is an instructive ones and that caught me by surprise because I really work with solving this early problem and go out and do other things.
There is more to be uncovered.
Oliver Williamson: Yes!";832;Environment
The mention of cooperatives in particular, leads into your work. You have studied the use of common-pool resources and the different ways that shared resources can be controlled. And your work comes against a back-drop I understand of a body of thought which was suggesting that outside control was the right way to manage, outside control was the right way to manage shared resources that outside control tended to stop people just overexploiting the resources they had access to. But you suggested that actually it was a little different and that common control of one’s own resources was often a more productive way, a more successful way of controlling their exploitation.;"Elinor Ostrom: A lot of people presumed that it was impossible for those who used a fishery or groundwater basin or a lake or river to self-organize. So self-organization was considered to be impossible and that was why they recommended either the market or the state not well defined not well worked out, but at least an idealized form. A great deal of research had been undertaken by people describing these efforts, but it was people in multiple disciplines about multiple sectors in multiple parts of the world, no cumulation. The presumption was the news headlines would always headline would give sardines were the story in California was a very great tragedy, but that did not mean that resources everywhere were being destroyed, but that’s what people payed attention to. What we have been trying to do is a systematic understanding of when will people engage in the transaction of self-organizing and then sustaining that organization over time. And they use a variety of forms, so sometimes they create a small government, but that’s not ‘the state’. The group of ground water harvesters I looked at in southern California created, there were 11 cities, all sorts of diversity, but they created something called a special district private water association, a variety of other things and did an incredible job without a single external authority doing it for them. It was tough, but they did self-organize and among the things they did was to develop their property right system.
That’s what I did for my dissertation and I did not know I was studying the commons. I was studying, I thought, Schumpeter’s problem of how do entrepreneurs develop and what did they do etc. I titled my dissertation “Public entrepreneurship” because that was the sort of thing that there were several leaders that were incredible in their effort that they put to getting people to meetings, getting them to discuss, getting them to sit down and this problem of conflict was just immense. If you can’t find a forum in which people can get the facts so that they aren’t arguing about facts at the same time they are arguing about what we should do and that makes a huge difference. In any case we now studied this in the experimental lab where we take the simple mathematical theory and have eight people in a lab making decisions that are the ones that come from the theory and indeed, if in a lab no communication is allowed so we have them sitting independently at a computer terminal around and can’t see each other, can’t communicate, they do overharvest. In fact, they overharvest worse than predicted.";832;Creativity
What do you give them to harvest in the lab?;"Elinor Ostrom: We give them a certain set of tokens that they can invest in two options, one of which is the same, mathematically, as the common pool resource. The other would be that they go out and work on job market 8 hours for a  set wage and there is an equilibrium concept called ‘the Nash equilibrium’ that you can take with a mathematical formulation and they should, according to the Nash equilibrium, pull out more resources from, because they are not cooperating. If we are all going in there and being aggressive you then harm each other and you, in the long run, are actually harmed because you are doing more than you should. Doing worse than Nash means they were even much more aggressive. We allowed one change in the lab, that people could engage in face to face communication, which in game theory was called ‘cheap talk’ because that process, if one person says ‘Why don’t we do x?’ and the others agreed, there was no external enforcer and without a third person enforcer the court or the state it was considered mere cheap talk. Well, mere cheap talk allowed them to greatly increase, they are a joint pay-off, and to preserve the mathematical resource and we tried a number of other things that we are seeing in the field.
We then studied irrigation systems around the world and compared farmer managed systems where the farmers have got to organize everything and figure out who is going to build and how they are going to build and who is going to do the labor and how they are going to allocate water, but they don’t have much, they do not have very many resources so they build very primitive systems. We have compared those with government systems with fancy concrete and beautiful gates and just fantastic amount of money put in them and they can get more water to the tail-end, they can produce more food and their efficiency is higher than the amount of the cost of the resources going in as opposed to the value of the what they obtained. So, to be more efficient, more equitable and do so with extremely primitive tools, a log that is what diverts the water, mud channels etc., is right amazing and now we are studying forests around the world.";832;Environment
As the study of these variety of systems has led you, in 1990, to produce a set of guiding principles so to say which suggest how common pool resources should be used?;Elinor Ostrom: That wasn’t quite my view, I was not doing the ‘should’. I was trying to understand a series of systems that had existed for two hundred or so years and we had good data about them and good information and where there any … I thought we quoted the specific rules they had used in many of these and I could not find a specific rule or set of rules that were always used, so I tried to move up a level and ask what were the generalities across the long-lasting robust systems, I called them design principles, not from the perspective that they were what you should do but if you wanted to be robust you should probably take this seriously but how you would actually apply that would differ from system to system. So, I didn’t mean that the farmers or fishermen or anyone had actually had the principles in mind but they were, maybe we could call it best practices, they worked, they worked over time and then we looked at the failures and they not have the same characteristics.;832;Research
But given that one must be able to look around the world and just see innumerable examples of places where it is not working as well as it should be. There must be quite a temptation to start saying ‘should’ because if you have got a set of desired principles which you see working broadly around the place. It must be quite tempting to think.;"Elinor Ostrom: Some people have applied it and I have a little bit of a tension with some of the ways it’s been applied because USAID and all sorts of – SIDA, others – have gone in and said: Now do this.  When one of the principles is that they have developed a way to have conflict resolution locally, well sometimes that’s they have a court, in Spain, in eastern Spain there is a court that has been maintained once a week for back to 1500, Valencia. It’s got a very stylized way of handling things that works for them because they have multiple systems, the water master on each of the systems comes in its under court and if there is a conflict on their system they leave the court and testify in front of it, but that’s a particular design that works very well, that when you get experts who know the problem and face with it every day and then you bring a conflict between two neighbors before and you got a decision now. That is conflict resolution within a week of the conflict emerging. Now that won’t work everywhere as a conflict mechanism, so why I am nervous about people who want to just impose it, and that has been happening from time to time, is: What is it you are imposing? Are you running training sessions with people to give them an idea of the array of conflict mechanisms that people have used and then ask them what are some of their traditions, their ways of doing things, then they may be able to develop a conflict mechanism that works for them, but sometimes that’s a traditional chief. Well, that won’t work in LA.
Or it might!
Elinor Ostrom: Well, not usually, might work in Chicago, not my /—/.
Oliver Williamson: If I could make a couple of remarks and relate to, I think both of our work, and one of them is that I think that we have in different ways explained that organization matters and is susceptible to analysis. A lot of people are persuaded that organization matters, but for a economists it’s important to show that its susceptible to analysis and by doing this kind of microanalytic research and establishing the pre-conditions for some of the stuff to go through was really vital. But also, they were both affiliated with new institutional economics and in a way institutional economics operates at a couple of levels, one of which is kind of this organizational governance level, but there is a higher level. It relates to this inability to have a ‘cookie cutter’ that you can just go in and stamp, that is different nation states, they are differently organized and different traditions and customs as Lin says and those are important to how you organize and that should be factored in rather than simple ignored or glossed over. The last thing I would suggest in this, suggest the ambition of this line of research is that right now we all of I think major states, have something that’s akin to a council of economic advisors and I think that they’re well advised is to have such. I think that organizations are sufficiently important and as we make progressive headway with our understanding of it I think that all nation states ought to begin thinking about having a counsel of organizational advisors so there is lots of stuff that’s going on in Washington DC and around the world right now that has huge organizational applications and isn’t being factored in the same systematic way that basic economics is and sometimes that comes back to serious regret.";832;Environment
I was going to ask about the frustration there must be in, when you study these things and, see people not thinking about it enough and whether that leads you ever to think or maybe having spent all this time studying it, I ought to be in more of a policy position myself and trying to make people listen from a different perspective. Is that a conflict you feel? Do you wish people would listen to you in a different way?;"Oliver Williamson: I think we make headway, and it takes time but actually one of the access points for me was I served as special economic assistant to the head of the antitrust division in 1966–67. These were marvelously capable people who had been running the antitrust division but they were doing in a one sided way, there are essentially using text book economics, micro economics supplemented by a little bit of industrial organization but there was almost no attention given to the possibility that organization was important and that instead if you saw a non-standard practice or organizational form, the immediate suspicion was this has anti-social, anti-competitive intent and it’s easy to run with that ball and get the courts to buy into it. And they did. But the other possibility was that some of these have benefits when they are associated with it and one of the things, they are trying to do is infuse confidence into contractual relations that otherwise would break down and that this is an efficient thing to do. And that point of view has made progressive headway. I don’t say it’s the mainstream now but there is much more interest in being symmetrical rather than one sided in our way of doing anti-trust enforcement, and doing regulation and it should be the case that as we design bureaus that this is actively taken into account and take the problem of homeland security that was put together in wrapped fashion in a way which I think many of us that are closer to the organizational side of things are say this really should have been vetted by people with organizational backgrounds and interest and capabilities.
Elinor Ostrom: I did series of studies that looked at a slightly different question now and public goods and how do you organize local metropolitan areas, because we started with water, but then I turned to policing. The presumption was that in a lot of the literature that fragmentation was evil and that what you needed was a single center. Hierarchy was the model that lot of reform efforts had in their mind, that hierarchy would solve all of the problems of metropolitan areas, and I was deeply suspicious of this having done work on a polycentric industry where there were public and private firms working together at multiple levels. It did not appear to me chaotic but many of my colleagues would put a map in a textbook and it would show some individual cities and then show some other units and the heading would be “The chaotic structure of x metropolitan area” because there were multiple units on the map that was chaos.
We studied policing in a number of smaller studies comparing very similar neighborhoods served by independent small departments versus large. We never found a large department that could out preform a small, partly because of knowledge and understanding the … I rode in a lot of patrol cars and if you were in a small or medium size patrol car the officer would tell you a lot about the neighborhood he was patrolling and really knew it. In large departments to cope with the problem of corruption, which happened in large departments, they rotated the officers and so they might have 90 districts and you rotated every 28 days. Well, you didn’t know much about that district so the knowledge level of the officer and the knowledge that the citizens had of the officers serving them was very low. We also then did a study of 80 metropolitan areas looking at the areas in terms of direct services like patrol being provided by small or medium size versus the problems of crime lab for which there were economies of scale, and the argument had been: the economy had scale for crime labs so consolidate everything. We found that in field in 80 metropolitan areas we found only 84 crime labs, so in the field officers and departments and majors had figured it out and they did all try to have their own crime lab, they frequently contracted with the local hospital that had all the equipment and just had to have some personnel that understood the problems of criminal investigation. In 80 metropolitan areas we found the most efficient and effective had some units at the very top and then had a large number of small to medium size direct producers.
This is an entirely different vision but its consistent with the idea that there isn’t just one way of organizing a corporation and this was there is one way of organizing a metropolitan area and I think our work, it complements each other’s because you can’t make those kinds of presumptions although the transaction costs involved in an interaction between a officer and a citizen who don’t know one and other and the interaction between an officer and a citizen who have seen each other in different times, their faces are familiar, you know a little bit about the background, is entirely different.";832;Environment
I am getting into hot water by using such terms. People are better able to, if you like, to look after themselves, they either use water in a common way more sensibly than  the government might think they might or if they’re local police forces they organize themselves more sensibly again than the government might think they might.;Elinor Ostrom: But there are settings in which they would just grab like that so you can’t just assume that people under any circumstance will always take into account others and always be good. Humans are neither all angels or all devils and so it is the context in the institutional context in which they find themselves that enable them to have more willingness to use reciprocity to trust one and other and to be in a situation that ‘I can trust you because I think you trust me, and I won’t be sucker’. And one of the problems with the commons is that if I trust everyone else is going to be a good guy and I am cooperative and there are not, I am a sucker and people are worried about being a sucker.;832;Environment
Are you surprised to find yourself studying what you study? Because you mention that you started out studying entrepreneurship as a graduate student and now you study the commons, when you look back, is it odd that you ended up here?;Elinor Ostrom: It’s a great honor to be in here, but I didn’t, I was studying the commons from the beginning, but I didn’t know it. I was studying a tough problem that people were trying to solve and entrepreneurship in the public or private sphere has to do with people who are able to understand some of the complexity of a setting and how to organize, so the capacity to organize is crucial and yes, the presumption has been the only way that people organize is inside the market or through a state and that’s what I think has to be, we have to move on to understanding that organization can occur at multiple scales and multiple ways and not always the best, so the mafia is organized. That is not always good.;832;Advice for female scientists
But I asked the question as a prelude to asking who you think ought to come into the area now, what are you looking for in terms of new blood to come in and advance the theory further. Is it possible to say? Is there something lacking?;"Oliver Williamson: It is a little bit idiosyncratic but I do think that there is a movement in economics to be more interdisciplinary and in pulling related disciplines together, whereas previously there is and I think there always will be a sense that economics is the prince of the social sciences but that there is a greater appreciation, I think, that there are complex phenomena that if you look at them exclusively through the lens of economics not assisted by any of any of contiguous sciences that you are going to be missing things. One of the things, one of the reasons why I think that I was able to look at some of the issues in anti-trust enforcement differently then was the sort of standard view was that I was part of a really unusual interdisciplinary program in social sciences at Carnegie Tech, then Carnegie Tech, now Carnegie Mellon, in which organization theory was thought to have co-equal status with economics and should both inform and be informed by economics.
There was sort of traffic across this boundary and I do think that having more of our students exposed to the contiguous social sciences and you know, your principal discipline could be political science and you will reach out to economics and that’s been going alright and could be economics and you reach out to political sciences or sociology and that’s been going on. So I think there is, I don’t think everybody by any means should be sort of multi-disciplinary in their work, but I would hope that there will be growing agreements that these sciences have a lot of common ground and that they should work on it in a collaborative way and then often it’s going to be a better more productive. It’s going to be more interesting as a matter research and it’s going to be more productive for the common well.
Elinor Ostrom: I also think interdisciplinarity is a very important. Vincent Ostrom and I established a center called a workshop in political theory and policy analysis back in 1973–74 and we have always had multiple disciplines around the table and that’s just been my life. We now are reaching out more to ecologists because of, if you’re studying forest, you have to learn a little bit more about the ecology of forest because again rules that work well in a deciduous forest don’t work well in a tropical wet forest and trying to understand the ecological foundations is very very tricky and I am having learned a lot of new concepts and new terms.
Are you specializing in forest studies?
Elinor Ostrom: No, it happens to be the applied area I am working in now heavily. I have a couple of articles I am working on, irrigation, so we have a large database and we have a book coming out in another 6 months or so assuming all of this. But I have just finished a book that I am very very pleased about with the title “Working together – collective choice, the commons and multiple methods in practice” and the thesis of it is besides interdisciplinary is multiple methods. Sometimes we have people only do a mathematical model or only do only case studies or only do large N and they criticize everything else and the problem is that we need to be able, either if we can’t ourselves do the model, that’s foolish but we need to be aware of the advantages and know enough about some of the methods that we can work with an expert in a method and then bring some of our knowledge from a different set of methods together. I love experimental work, but it doesn’t have the richness that I have when I study forests in the field. I love both of them as ways of different ways of getting insights and sometimes being in the field leads back to the lab. In particular I kept seeing people monitoring and sanctioning each other in the field, amazing times and so I came back from a particular vivid occasion in Nepal and said to my colleague Roy Gardner who is a game theorist and Jimmy Walker who is an experimentalist: Let’s please, let’s do a formal game involving people paying their own cost to sanction others, because in the field if they go this was an instance where someone had dug into an irrigation and so several of them went running down the hill and yelling and screaming and others starting patching it immediately and I mean the energy they put in, they didn’t not think about it. There was no rational calculation about this, they just did it.
Well again and the game theory prediction is they wouldn’t, then we could put it in the lab with a simple game we used earlier, but now changing one attribute and giving them a chance to pay a fee to find someone and they did it even though it’s predicted they won’t and if we gave them eventually the choice of what kind of sanctioning mechanism they had and then allowed them to use it, they got to about 94% of optimal. And here is having the game theory model great because we knew what optimal was and we could put it in the lab and figure out what happened, but that was field lab and now on our forest studies because of our earlier findings we asked quite about monitoring and sanctioning. We are finding that whether people who use a forest actually monitor each other to be more important then who owns. Government ownership, private ownership, community organization – all of those are important but if they, the formal rules are there, and the users don’t see a future and don’t see that they are involved and don’t take an interest and don’t monitor – forest goes down.";832;Creativity
Forgive this last question, but since you both work on organization theory and the right use of common resources, I wonder whether you are organized people yourselves or whether you are good at organizing things like a complex family which are five children I believe.;"Oliver Williamson: That’s true! Well, I think of myself as being disciplined and I guess because I enjoy my work so much I spend a lot of time struggling with new and different issues trying to understand them and trying to see if I can find ways to fold them in and whether or not they have public policy ramifications and the like. It’s been a joyness of work and see things make headways and have good students come through. And its obvious from what Lin says that she’s just really wrapped up in this stuff, its easy to. I wouldn’t call myself an excellent organizer but then the less that it does require keeping a lot of disparate ideas in mind and finding ways to pull them together. There is a certain amount of background organization that goes on. Sometimes actually to my surprise, this has been true more recently than it was when I was a younger fellow, but I will start dreaming about some of this stuff and thinking about what I should be doing and if the ideas are good enough. It doesn’t always turn out that they are, but I get up and jot little notes down and then get back to sleep rather than struggle in the middle of the night and so I have got some subconscious work in front of me, too.
That quite an advantage.
Elinor Ostrom: We have an unusual center that Vincent and I organized long ago, and we had an opportunity both to be in Germany at Bielefeld at the interdisciplinary center and saw the advantage of working with young postdocs as opposed to just graduate students and so we innovated and developed a postdoctoral program, modest in size. That has been a very successful way of both organizing the research side and the teaching side because you have graduate students who are, some of them state of the art on their new tools, but then they are able to talk to young to middle faculty who are not their supervisors but are in the same building and going to the same seminars and discussing when they get and sometimes you know its two-way learning. Then to have interdisciplinary teams and what we have learned is we have had to learn new rules and ways of organizing as we have run into things over time and so adjustability and new circumstances lead you to have to do things slightly differently. We have had the good fortune of a wonderful set of colleagues from all over the world and I think one of the things that will be happening, as far as new entrance, is that we will have more scholars from the developing world and from Asia and that will be contributing to our joint knowledge because they have different experiences and are bringing in new ideas and new ways of thinking about it so I see that as part of the future.
That seems like a marvelous way.
Oliver Williamson: Do you mind if I come back to the organizational issue. One of the things that I was wise about doing is I never took seriously and followed up on any opportunities on to be a Dean.
Elinor Ostrom: Yes, same.
Oliver Williamson: And my experience as department chair is that this was mainly discouraging. There are several things that I did do that did have organizational ramifications and one was when I was at Penn then at Yale and then at University of California Berkeley. I helped to organize workshop and obviously the workshop has been really important to Lin’s work and it’s been important to mine and having colleagues around it interacting and in a constructive way. There is another thing I did, got into it a sort of a backdoor of being a member of the editorial board of the then Bell Journal of Economics, now the RAND Journal of Economics and so I was going to become editor of it and as editor you have a lot of opportunity to move the field around and I have a bunch of really exceptional associate editors who shared a lot of my views in this, probably because I recruited them, but I think that was very satisfying experience. Then when I went to Yale, Yale Law School was interested in having a journal that was edited by the faculty rather than by students, as most law journals are, and we organized a journal of law, economics and organization and I am proud of the accomplishments of that journal. If I put my heart into it I guess I can organize, but taking on jobs like Deans which are important requires you to be a lot more tolerant than I am.";832;Creativity
I think when I phoned you both in October you were both somewhat surprised by the name, it’s a bit of a liability on that day of the announcement. How have the couple of months since the announcements been for you?;"Oliver Williamson: In a word – hectic.
Elinor Ostrom: And two words – very hectic.
You must be catapulted into a spotlight and a world of activity.
Oliver Williamson: It is, one of the things that is really gratifying however is how much goodwill you soak out from hearing from friends, former students, colleagues and family. It’s unreal but it’s there and so genuine that I couldn’t have imagine it.
That is nice.
Elinor Ostrom: I double that, some parts of the e-mail load are not friends and family and trying to cope with that has been a bit of a challenge. For our former students and colleagues all over the world, they have been sending joyous messages and that is very gratifying.";833;Creativity
And since you are the first woman to have been awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in its 40-year history I imagine that is slightly added to the load you have been under.;"Elinor Ostrom: Yes, I think that there have been many people who have been particularly asking about gender problems in American universities. Universities more general, it’s not just US.
I am sorry, you must be terrible bored of discussing this, but the fact that there has been one in 40 years, do you think that is in any way representative of the female contribution to economics over the last 40 years?
Elinor Ostrom: Not the contribution, but the capability to be in academia.
Do you see things improving?
Elinor Ostrom: Yes, I think that many departments now have new graduate students coming in at a rate, new women graduate students that they did not have previously, and our departments are moving toward hiring more. I don’t think I will be the last.
Do you see a change in the Nobel women coming to the subject?
Oliver Williamson: Oh yes, yes, and as Lin suggests, many are really excellent, and they get good placements and they are doing good work and we are going to hear from them.
Elinor Ostrom: Yes!";833;The impact of nobel on you
So the prize this year is divided into two parts, but you are united in your work by the phrase the committee used such as ‘economic governance’ and broadly you both study ways of regulating transactions in the broader sense. If I could start with you, you study complex economic organizations and complex transactions and one part of your work that has been particularly sort of commented on by the committee is the fact that that allows you to say something about what sort of transactions should be conducted within firms and what sort of transactions should be conducted within a market.;"Oliver Williamson: Yes!
Can you give examples of the sort of transaction that we are talking about when we say that?
Oliver Williamson: Yes, but I wonder if I could back off for a minute and talk about governance, because there is a compact two-sentence statement that was made by John R. Commons who was an older stylist, institutional economist, and I think undervalued by a lot of people then and since but never the less profound in many of his insights. And the two-sentence statement runs roughly as follows: “The principal unit of analysis should contain in itself, the three principles of conflict, mutuality and order. This unit is a transaction”. The part of it that I initially related to, because I was working at this more microanalytic level of transactions rather than completed goods and services, was that the transactions /- – -/ analysis. But as I got deeper into the study of organization, I started to ask what is the value added for some of these more complex forms of organization.
This triple of conflict, mutuality and order goes right to the essence and specifically I would describe governance as the means by which to infuse order thereby a medicate conflict and realize mutual games and that was contemplated, I would say, by Commons, even though he didn’t have much success in implementing it. That’s a profound sense of what I think was a missing arena for economics for a long time. A specific example would be the first project that I undertook along these lines and that’s the make-or-buy decision that firms was confronted with, it needs a specialized component let us say. It can either outsource to a independent contractor and mediate that transaction with a written contract that stipulates what’s to be delivered when, why and how they are going to handle difficulties in the like or you can take that transaction out of the market and organize it internally which is the make decision and vertical integrations issues had been around for a long time, addressed mainly as a technological issue addressing it in contractual terms with reference to two alternatives that one might have an advantage over the other or not. But the challenge was to first look at it contractually actually compartive contractually because you always want to think of two or more alternative ways of getting it done and then thirdly one other fact is that to drive it around in one way or another. And working that through was the transaction cost’s economics challenge.";833;Creativity
I can see that you can analyze a situation in which a firm is saying should we have this component made outside, buy it in or should we make it ourselves? But you have been able to turn that into theories which suggest in which circumstances the make decision is correct, which circumstances the buy decision is correct and then those theories have been put out to empirical testing and they presumably refine the theory. Is it now, are you able to suggest principles by which firms can govern their decision to the make-or-buy decision?;"Oliver Williamson: What you need to do is you need to identify the critical attributes that define transactions so that operationalizing that the concept of transaction by naming what you take to be the critical factors across which transactions cost will vary. Then secondly you need to do the same thing with reference to governance structures, you need to identity the critical dimensions with respect to which governance structures differ. Then you ask the question given this cluster of attributes of transactions. Do they pose easy or complicated kinds of contractual issues? If they are easy, there are lots of easy transactions, I mean this is what spot markets and so are all about, neither party has any kind of dependency relation on the other. It’s sort of the classical problem of exchanging nuts for berries at the edge of the forest, you know. We both benefit from the exchange, but we don’t have any continuing relationship. Where you have to have a continuing relationship, where one party needs to make specialized investments in support of the other and where this contract may break down if it’s done in an intra-firm fashion, that’s where the concept of taking transactions out of the market and organizing them internally is important.
And actually, there is two other sort of major figures that I would say that enter into this and one is, both of them talk about adaptation as being the central problem of economic organization. One of these people is an organization theorist also from the 1930s, namely Chester Barnard, and he was interested in what it was distinctive that was going on within firms and his fear was that coordinated adaptation was the central kind of a contribution that internal organization had to bring and during that in a conscious deliberate purposeful way. This was, I would say, the marvel of internal organization, all was bureaucracy then and since it has been widely scorned. Sometimes for good reasons, but nevertheless there are things that internal organizations are especially good at. The other person was Friedrich Hayek, former Nobel Prize winner, that emphasized autonomous adaptations accomplished to the market in response to changes of relative prizes. This was the marvel of the market as economists had long regarded it but as Hayek specifically nailed it. Well, we have two marvels actually, the marvel of the market and the marvel of hierarchy and we had to appreciate both of them, and we had to know the strength and weaknesses of both of them and that’s part of the exercise.";833;Creativity
Is this very much an area of on-going study? Do we know the strength and weaknesses of the firm versus the market or is this just something that is going to continue to evolve as firms evolve and the world becomes more global and all of this?;"Oliver Williamson: Well,I don’t think this exercise is over, but I do think that we have made headway and an appreciation for firms and it goes beyond firms and markets, I mean there is also a place for bureaus, theres’s a place for cooperatives. There are lots of challenges that haven’t yet been uncovered and some that have that need to be more fully refined. But one other thing that I would also say, and that is that beyond intermediate product market transactions or close approximations theretoo, any issue that you can, that either arises as or can be reformulated in contracting terms is an issue that you can get some deeper insights by addressing it in transaction cost economizing terms. That isn’t to say that’s the only ones to bring to bear, but it is an instructive ones and that caught me by surprise because I really work with solving this early problem and go out and do other things.
There is more to be uncovered.
Oliver Williamson: Yes!";833;Environment
The mention of cooperatives in particular, leads into your work. You have studied the use of common-pool resources and the different ways that shared resources can be controlled. And your work comes against a back-drop I understand of a body of thought which was suggesting that outside control was the right way to manage, outside control was the right way to manage shared resources that outside control tended to stop people just overexploiting the resources they had access to. But you suggested that actually it was a little different and that common control of one’s own resources was often a more productive way, a more successful way of controlling their exploitation.;"Elinor Ostrom: A lot of people presumed that it was impossible for those who used a fishery or groundwater basin or a lake or river to self-organize. So self-organization was considered to be impossible and that was why they recommended either the market or the state not well defined not well worked out, but at least an idealized form. A great deal of research had been undertaken by people describing these efforts, but it was people in multiple disciplines about multiple sectors in multiple parts of the world, no cumulation. The presumption was the news headlines would always headline would give sardines were the story in California was a very great tragedy, but that did not mean that resources everywhere were being destroyed, but that’s what people payed attention to. What we have been trying to do is a systematic understanding of when will people engage in the transaction of self-organizing and then sustaining that organization over time. And they use a variety of forms, so sometimes they create a small government, but that’s not ‘the state’. The group of ground water harvesters I looked at in southern California created, there were 11 cities, all sorts of diversity, but they created something called a special district private water association, a variety of other things and did an incredible job without a single external authority doing it for them. It was tough, but they did self-organize and among the things they did was to develop their property right system.
That’s what I did for my dissertation and I did not know I was studying the commons. I was studying, I thought, Schumpeter’s problem of how do entrepreneurs develop and what did they do etc. I titled my dissertation “Public entrepreneurship” because that was the sort of thing that there were several leaders that were incredible in their effort that they put to getting people to meetings, getting them to discuss, getting them to sit down and this problem of conflict was just immense. If you can’t find a forum in which people can get the facts so that they aren’t arguing about facts at the same time they are arguing about what we should do and that makes a huge difference. In any case we now studied this in the experimental lab where we take the simple mathematical theory and have eight people in a lab making decisions that are the ones that come from the theory and indeed, if in a lab no communication is allowed so we have them sitting independently at a computer terminal around and can’t see each other, can’t communicate, they do overharvest. In fact, they overharvest worse than predicted.";833;Creativity
What do you give them to harvest in the lab?;"Elinor Ostrom: We give them a certain set of tokens that they can invest in two options, one of which is the same, mathematically, as the common pool resource. The other would be that they go out and work on job market 8 hours for a  set wage and there is an equilibrium concept called ‘the Nash equilibrium’ that you can take with a mathematical formulation and they should, according to the Nash equilibrium, pull out more resources from, because they are not cooperating. If we are all going in there and being aggressive you then harm each other and you, in the long run, are actually harmed because you are doing more than you should. Doing worse than Nash means they were even much more aggressive. We allowed one change in the lab, that people could engage in face to face communication, which in game theory was called ‘cheap talk’ because that process, if one person says ‘Why don’t we do x?’ and the others agreed, there was no external enforcer and without a third person enforcer the court or the state it was considered mere cheap talk. Well, mere cheap talk allowed them to greatly increase, they are a joint pay-off, and to preserve the mathematical resource and we tried a number of other things that we are seeing in the field.
We then studied irrigation systems around the world and compared farmer managed systems where the farmers have got to organize everything and figure out who is going to build and how they are going to build and who is going to do the labor and how they are going to allocate water, but they don’t have much, they do not have very many resources so they build very primitive systems. We have compared those with government systems with fancy concrete and beautiful gates and just fantastic amount of money put in them and they can get more water to the tail-end, they can produce more food and their efficiency is higher than the amount of the cost of the resources going in as opposed to the value of the what they obtained. So, to be more efficient, more equitable and do so with extremely primitive tools, a log that is what diverts the water, mud channels etc., is right amazing and now we are studying forests around the world.";833;Environment
As the study of these variety of systems has led you, in 1990, to produce a set of guiding principles so to say which suggest how common pool resources should be used?;Elinor Ostrom: That wasn’t quite my view, I was not doing the ‘should’. I was trying to understand a series of systems that had existed for two hundred or so years and we had good data about them and good information and where there any … I thought we quoted the specific rules they had used in many of these and I could not find a specific rule or set of rules that were always used, so I tried to move up a level and ask what were the generalities across the long-lasting robust systems, I called them design principles, not from the perspective that they were what you should do but if you wanted to be robust you should probably take this seriously but how you would actually apply that would differ from system to system. So, I didn’t mean that the farmers or fishermen or anyone had actually had the principles in mind but they were, maybe we could call it best practices, they worked, they worked over time and then we looked at the failures and they not have the same characteristics.;833;Research
But given that one must be able to look around the world and just see innumerable examples of places where it is not working as well as it should be. There must be quite a temptation to start saying ‘should’ because if you have got a set of desired principles which you see working broadly around the place. It must be quite tempting to think.;"Elinor Ostrom: Some people have applied it and I have a little bit of a tension with some of the ways it’s been applied because USAID and all sorts of – SIDA, others – have gone in and said: Now do this.  When one of the principles is that they have developed a way to have conflict resolution locally, well sometimes that’s they have a court, in Spain, in eastern Spain there is a court that has been maintained once a week for back to 1500, Valencia. It’s got a very stylized way of handling things that works for them because they have multiple systems, the water master on each of the systems comes in its under court and if there is a conflict on their system they leave the court and testify in front of it, but that’s a particular design that works very well, that when you get experts who know the problem and face with it every day and then you bring a conflict between two neighbors before and you got a decision now. That is conflict resolution within a week of the conflict emerging. Now that won’t work everywhere as a conflict mechanism, so why I am nervous about people who want to just impose it, and that has been happening from time to time, is: What is it you are imposing? Are you running training sessions with people to give them an idea of the array of conflict mechanisms that people have used and then ask them what are some of their traditions, their ways of doing things, then they may be able to develop a conflict mechanism that works for them, but sometimes that’s a traditional chief. Well, that won’t work in LA.
Or it might!
Elinor Ostrom: Well, not usually, might work in Chicago, not my /—/.
Oliver Williamson: If I could make a couple of remarks and relate to, I think both of our work, and one of them is that I think that we have in different ways explained that organization matters and is susceptible to analysis. A lot of people are persuaded that organization matters, but for a economists it’s important to show that its susceptible to analysis and by doing this kind of microanalytic research and establishing the pre-conditions for some of the stuff to go through was really vital. But also, they were both affiliated with new institutional economics and in a way institutional economics operates at a couple of levels, one of which is kind of this organizational governance level, but there is a higher level. It relates to this inability to have a ‘cookie cutter’ that you can just go in and stamp, that is different nation states, they are differently organized and different traditions and customs as Lin says and those are important to how you organize and that should be factored in rather than simple ignored or glossed over. The last thing I would suggest in this, suggest the ambition of this line of research is that right now we all of I think major states, have something that’s akin to a council of economic advisors and I think that they’re well advised is to have such. I think that organizations are sufficiently important and as we make progressive headway with our understanding of it I think that all nation states ought to begin thinking about having a counsel of organizational advisors so there is lots of stuff that’s going on in Washington DC and around the world right now that has huge organizational applications and isn’t being factored in the same systematic way that basic economics is and sometimes that comes back to serious regret.";833;Environment
I was going to ask about the frustration there must be in, when you study these things and, see people not thinking about it enough and whether that leads you ever to think or maybe having spent all this time studying it, I ought to be in more of a policy position myself and trying to make people listen from a different perspective. Is that a conflict you feel? Do you wish people would listen to you in a different way?;"Oliver Williamson: I think we make headway, and it takes time but actually one of the access points for me was I served as special economic assistant to the head of the antitrust division in 1966–67. These were marvelously capable people who had been running the antitrust division but they were doing in a one sided way, there are essentially using text book economics, micro economics supplemented by a little bit of industrial organization but there was almost no attention given to the possibility that organization was important and that instead if you saw a non-standard practice or organizational form, the immediate suspicion was this has anti-social, anti-competitive intent and it’s easy to run with that ball and get the courts to buy into it. And they did. But the other possibility was that some of these have benefits when they are associated with it and one of the things, they are trying to do is infuse confidence into contractual relations that otherwise would break down and that this is an efficient thing to do. And that point of view has made progressive headway. I don’t say it’s the mainstream now but there is much more interest in being symmetrical rather than one sided in our way of doing anti-trust enforcement, and doing regulation and it should be the case that as we design bureaus that this is actively taken into account and take the problem of homeland security that was put together in wrapped fashion in a way which I think many of us that are closer to the organizational side of things are say this really should have been vetted by people with organizational backgrounds and interest and capabilities.
Elinor Ostrom: I did series of studies that looked at a slightly different question now and public goods and how do you organize local metropolitan areas, because we started with water, but then I turned to policing. The presumption was that in a lot of the literature that fragmentation was evil and that what you needed was a single center. Hierarchy was the model that lot of reform efforts had in their mind, that hierarchy would solve all of the problems of metropolitan areas, and I was deeply suspicious of this having done work on a polycentric industry where there were public and private firms working together at multiple levels. It did not appear to me chaotic but many of my colleagues would put a map in a textbook and it would show some individual cities and then show some other units and the heading would be “The chaotic structure of x metropolitan area” because there were multiple units on the map that was chaos.
We studied policing in a number of smaller studies comparing very similar neighborhoods served by independent small departments versus large. We never found a large department that could out preform a small, partly because of knowledge and understanding the … I rode in a lot of patrol cars and if you were in a small or medium size patrol car the officer would tell you a lot about the neighborhood he was patrolling and really knew it. In large departments to cope with the problem of corruption, which happened in large departments, they rotated the officers and so they might have 90 districts and you rotated every 28 days. Well, you didn’t know much about that district so the knowledge level of the officer and the knowledge that the citizens had of the officers serving them was very low. We also then did a study of 80 metropolitan areas looking at the areas in terms of direct services like patrol being provided by small or medium size versus the problems of crime lab for which there were economies of scale, and the argument had been: the economy had scale for crime labs so consolidate everything. We found that in field in 80 metropolitan areas we found only 84 crime labs, so in the field officers and departments and majors had figured it out and they did all try to have their own crime lab, they frequently contracted with the local hospital that had all the equipment and just had to have some personnel that understood the problems of criminal investigation. In 80 metropolitan areas we found the most efficient and effective had some units at the very top and then had a large number of small to medium size direct producers.
This is an entirely different vision but its consistent with the idea that there isn’t just one way of organizing a corporation and this was there is one way of organizing a metropolitan area and I think our work, it complements each other’s because you can’t make those kinds of presumptions although the transaction costs involved in an interaction between a officer and a citizen who don’t know one and other and the interaction between an officer and a citizen who have seen each other in different times, their faces are familiar, you know a little bit about the background, is entirely different.";833;Environment
I am getting into hot water by using such terms. People are better able to, if you like, to look after themselves, they either use water in a common way more sensibly than  the government might think they might or if they’re local police forces they organize themselves more sensibly again than the government might think they might.;Elinor Ostrom: But there are settings in which they would just grab like that so you can’t just assume that people under any circumstance will always take into account others and always be good. Humans are neither all angels or all devils and so it is the context in the institutional context in which they find themselves that enable them to have more willingness to use reciprocity to trust one and other and to be in a situation that ‘I can trust you because I think you trust me, and I won’t be sucker’. And one of the problems with the commons is that if I trust everyone else is going to be a good guy and I am cooperative and there are not, I am a sucker and people are worried about being a sucker.;833;Environment
Are you surprised to find yourself studying what you study? Because you mention that you started out studying entrepreneurship as a graduate student and now you study the commons, when you look back, is it odd that you ended up here?;Elinor Ostrom: It’s a great honor to be in here, but I didn’t, I was studying the commons from the beginning, but I didn’t know it. I was studying a tough problem that people were trying to solve and entrepreneurship in the public or private sphere has to do with people who are able to understand some of the complexity of a setting and how to organize, so the capacity to organize is crucial and yes, the presumption has been the only way that people organize is inside the market or through a state and that’s what I think has to be, we have to move on to understanding that organization can occur at multiple scales and multiple ways and not always the best, so the mafia is organized. That is not always good.;833;Advice for female scientists
But I asked the question as a prelude to asking who you think ought to come into the area now, what are you looking for in terms of new blood to come in and advance the theory further. Is it possible to say? Is there something lacking?;"Oliver Williamson: It is a little bit idiosyncratic but I do think that there is a movement in economics to be more interdisciplinary and in pulling related disciplines together, whereas previously there is and I think there always will be a sense that economics is the prince of the social sciences but that there is a greater appreciation, I think, that there are complex phenomena that if you look at them exclusively through the lens of economics not assisted by any of any of contiguous sciences that you are going to be missing things. One of the things, one of the reasons why I think that I was able to look at some of the issues in anti-trust enforcement differently then was the sort of standard view was that I was part of a really unusual interdisciplinary program in social sciences at Carnegie Tech, then Carnegie Tech, now Carnegie Mellon, in which organization theory was thought to have co-equal status with economics and should both inform and be informed by economics.
There was sort of traffic across this boundary and I do think that having more of our students exposed to the contiguous social sciences and you know, your principal discipline could be political science and you will reach out to economics and that’s been going alright and could be economics and you reach out to political sciences or sociology and that’s been going on. So I think there is, I don’t think everybody by any means should be sort of multi-disciplinary in their work, but I would hope that there will be growing agreements that these sciences have a lot of common ground and that they should work on it in a collaborative way and then often it’s going to be a better more productive. It’s going to be more interesting as a matter research and it’s going to be more productive for the common well.
Elinor Ostrom: I also think interdisciplinarity is a very important. Vincent Ostrom and I established a center called a workshop in political theory and policy analysis back in 1973–74 and we have always had multiple disciplines around the table and that’s just been my life. We now are reaching out more to ecologists because of, if you’re studying forest, you have to learn a little bit more about the ecology of forest because again rules that work well in a deciduous forest don’t work well in a tropical wet forest and trying to understand the ecological foundations is very very tricky and I am having learned a lot of new concepts and new terms.
Are you specializing in forest studies?
Elinor Ostrom: No, it happens to be the applied area I am working in now heavily. I have a couple of articles I am working on, irrigation, so we have a large database and we have a book coming out in another 6 months or so assuming all of this. But I have just finished a book that I am very very pleased about with the title “Working together – collective choice, the commons and multiple methods in practice” and the thesis of it is besides interdisciplinary is multiple methods. Sometimes we have people only do a mathematical model or only do only case studies or only do large N and they criticize everything else and the problem is that we need to be able, either if we can’t ourselves do the model, that’s foolish but we need to be aware of the advantages and know enough about some of the methods that we can work with an expert in a method and then bring some of our knowledge from a different set of methods together. I love experimental work, but it doesn’t have the richness that I have when I study forests in the field. I love both of them as ways of different ways of getting insights and sometimes being in the field leads back to the lab. In particular I kept seeing people monitoring and sanctioning each other in the field, amazing times and so I came back from a particular vivid occasion in Nepal and said to my colleague Roy Gardner who is a game theorist and Jimmy Walker who is an experimentalist: Let’s please, let’s do a formal game involving people paying their own cost to sanction others, because in the field if they go this was an instance where someone had dug into an irrigation and so several of them went running down the hill and yelling and screaming and others starting patching it immediately and I mean the energy they put in, they didn’t not think about it. There was no rational calculation about this, they just did it.
Well again and the game theory prediction is they wouldn’t, then we could put it in the lab with a simple game we used earlier, but now changing one attribute and giving them a chance to pay a fee to find someone and they did it even though it’s predicted they won’t and if we gave them eventually the choice of what kind of sanctioning mechanism they had and then allowed them to use it, they got to about 94% of optimal. And here is having the game theory model great because we knew what optimal was and we could put it in the lab and figure out what happened, but that was field lab and now on our forest studies because of our earlier findings we asked quite about monitoring and sanctioning. We are finding that whether people who use a forest actually monitor each other to be more important then who owns. Government ownership, private ownership, community organization – all of those are important but if they, the formal rules are there, and the users don’t see a future and don’t see that they are involved and don’t take an interest and don’t monitor – forest goes down.";833;Creativity
Forgive this last question, but since you both work on organization theory and the right use of common resources, I wonder whether you are organized people yourselves or whether you are good at organizing things like a complex family which are five children I believe.;"Oliver Williamson: That’s true! Well, I think of myself as being disciplined and I guess because I enjoy my work so much I spend a lot of time struggling with new and different issues trying to understand them and trying to see if I can find ways to fold them in and whether or not they have public policy ramifications and the like. It’s been a joyness of work and see things make headways and have good students come through. And its obvious from what Lin says that she’s just really wrapped up in this stuff, its easy to. I wouldn’t call myself an excellent organizer but then the less that it does require keeping a lot of disparate ideas in mind and finding ways to pull them together. There is a certain amount of background organization that goes on. Sometimes actually to my surprise, this has been true more recently than it was when I was a younger fellow, but I will start dreaming about some of this stuff and thinking about what I should be doing and if the ideas are good enough. It doesn’t always turn out that they are, but I get up and jot little notes down and then get back to sleep rather than struggle in the middle of the night and so I have got some subconscious work in front of me, too.
That quite an advantage.
Elinor Ostrom: We have an unusual center that Vincent and I organized long ago, and we had an opportunity both to be in Germany at Bielefeld at the interdisciplinary center and saw the advantage of working with young postdocs as opposed to just graduate students and so we innovated and developed a postdoctoral program, modest in size. That has been a very successful way of both organizing the research side and the teaching side because you have graduate students who are, some of them state of the art on their new tools, but then they are able to talk to young to middle faculty who are not their supervisors but are in the same building and going to the same seminars and discussing when they get and sometimes you know its two-way learning. Then to have interdisciplinary teams and what we have learned is we have had to learn new rules and ways of organizing as we have run into things over time and so adjustability and new circumstances lead you to have to do things slightly differently. We have had the good fortune of a wonderful set of colleagues from all over the world and I think one of the things that will be happening, as far as new entrance, is that we will have more scholars from the developing world and from Asia and that will be contributing to our joint knowledge because they have different experiences and are bringing in new ideas and new ways of thinking about it so I see that as part of the future.
That seems like a marvelous way.
Oliver Williamson: Do you mind if I come back to the organizational issue. One of the things that I was wise about doing is I never took seriously and followed up on any opportunities on to be a Dean.
Elinor Ostrom: Yes, same.
Oliver Williamson: And my experience as department chair is that this was mainly discouraging. There are several things that I did do that did have organizational ramifications and one was when I was at Penn then at Yale and then at University of California Berkeley. I helped to organize workshop and obviously the workshop has been really important to Lin’s work and it’s been important to mine and having colleagues around it interacting and in a constructive way. There is another thing I did, got into it a sort of a backdoor of being a member of the editorial board of the then Bell Journal of Economics, now the RAND Journal of Economics and so I was going to become editor of it and as editor you have a lot of opportunity to move the field around and I have a bunch of really exceptional associate editors who shared a lot of my views in this, probably because I recruited them, but I think that was very satisfying experience. Then when I went to Yale, Yale Law School was interested in having a journal that was edited by the faculty rather than by students, as most law journals are, and we organized a journal of law, economics and organization and I am proud of the accomplishments of that journal. If I put my heart into it I guess I can organize, but taking on jobs like Deans which are important requires you to be a lot more tolerant than I am.";833;Creativity
Yes and how big a crisis do you feel it’s going to be?;Oh, it’s awesome, I mean without an active policy response, it would be another great depression, it really is a financial crisis rivalling in scale, the bank runs that were really at the core of what made the Great Depression so great and so. No, this is like nothing that has happened in my lifetime.;834;Motivation
Do you find yourself being talked to more because of the award of the Nobel Prize in October, has it increased the focus on you, do you think?;Some, but I was pretty busy anyway. I’m probably getting, you might say, a higher quality of TV show, but this was one of the lines of work I have had is in fact financial crises. I write for the New York Times so I’m something of a public figure anyway and this crisis is very much up, you know we can say it’s up my alley, my kind of thing. The kind of thing that I used to have to fly off to Jakarta or Buenos Aires to see but now it’s in New York, so I’m in the middle of it anyway.;834;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Does it make it more difficult to report on it because you have this journalistic side to you as well as at the same time trying to suggest solutions to it?;I mean, it’s a special role. Actually I’m an opinion journalist so I’m expected to do stuff and in fact, I’m basically trying to work on multiple …, I write the 800 words layman’s pieces for the New York Times, I write longer pieces, some are posted on my blogs, various sorts of things that are more addressed to the commons and then there’s an enormous amount of off the record discussion of various types going on, this crisis isn’t going to … if we fail to deal with it, it’s not going to be because of lack of intelligent and very animated discussion.;834;Creativity
We’ll come back to the op-ed piece and the journalism later and of course you’re known to many as an economics and political commentator, especially through the New York Times pieces, but this prize is actually for your development of economic models, to explain international trade and economic geography.;"That’s right, until the age of 40 I was very much a pure academic and if anyone remembers 50 years from now, what they’ll remember is the work on trade and geography about some big questions, enduring questions of economics, but you know academics in their mid 50’s in economics quite often are doing other things, you know, some of my my cohorts in graduate school included people like Jeff Sachs and Larry Summers who seem to have done a few things beyond their economic modelling so it’s not that unusual to be doing something. But yes I tell people the prize is not about the columns, the prize is about papers that you can’t read.
Yes, you refer to them as Greek letter papers.
Paul Krugman: That’s right, you know I’ve spent a good part of my life using you know … of substitution, utility functions and iceberg transportation costs and true price into season, all the various tools that one uses to simplify these issues on trade and geography down to something where you can actually think about them clearly and I’m not going to put that in the daily newspaper but that’s where you start.";834;Career Development
What turned you on to be an economist in the first place?;"Oh, it’s an embarrassing story but I’ve told it publicly a couple of times. I was an avid Science Fiction reader when I was a teenager and there is the classic set of novels by Isaac Asimov, the Foundation novels, which are about how a group of social scientists save galactic civilisation through their understanding of the laws that determine the behaviour of societies and I wanted to be one of those guys and the closest you can get at this point I’m afraid is being an economist.
Do you still believe that economists have that role?
Paul Krugman: In the novels these people are able to predict with high accuracy what’s going to happen and find the precise intervention that saves civilisation. Economics doesn’t work that good, but no, there’s a tremendous amount of understanding that comes from economic models and sometimes that understanding can be the salvation of the economy. I believe that we’re living in one of those times right now. If we had only the level of economic knowledge that the world had in 1929, I believe we would have another Great Depression. The reason to believe that that won’t happen is that we think we understand this thing, at least somewhat better than our grandfathers did.";834;Motivation
This is a perfect segway because I wanted to ask you about the development of models. It was in 1979 that you published your new trade theory and that is a model explaining why similar countries trade in similar goods. Now one can express the model in the theory in fairly sort of self-evident terms, simple language and it all sounds as if it makes sense and yet one needs an atheoretical underpinning based on proper economic science in order to really understand.;Yes, you know it’s an interesting thing because the plain English came later, it’s not as if there was an intuitive story that was widely understood and what I did was find a way to mathematically model it. What actually happened was that I and a number of other people started using these models to try and model something, it was a little bit unclear exactly what it was we were trying to get at and as the models became clearer, they crystallised an intuition which you could then say, of course. It’s a little bit like the old joke about the Professor at the blackboard saying, obviously then … then he stops and pauses for 20 minutes and says I’m right, it was obvious, and these simple intuitive stories that we can now tell, I can now explain in a few hundred words in plain English what drives intra-industry trade among advanced countries. But no-one was doing that before, it really took the modelling. As it happens, having been there, I remember how hard it was to try and figure out which way the strategic simplifications needed to go to make this thing coherent and then afterwards it seems, well of course it’s obvious but there’s very much an after the fact interpretation.;834;Meaning(Values) of Work
Do you think that that’s perhaps a sort of peculiarity of economic sciences that in other sciences, I don’t know, in biology or chemistry, even when you try and explain the theory in simple language, the language we’re using is a strange language, a language that’s particular to the subject whereas economics, when one explains that you use the English or whatever language, that everybody understands and so everybody feels they ought to be able to sort of get in there and massage it?;It’s not even true of all economics, I mean and it’s not necessarily that we’re talking about the highly technical fields. I think, as it happens, the areas in which I worked, trade, economic geography, the concepts are for the most part pretty intuitive although you know there’s quite a lot of stuff that pops up when you work through it that is not part of the intuition. I’m sacrificing quite a lot to explain it just in plain English but there are other things, Keynesian macroeconomics which is critical right now. Although it’s quite simple in a way, also there’s a subtlety about the concept that really does require, if not math, at least some very, very close logic and what reveals that fact is that so many people to this day just don’t get it or actively deny it, say this can’t be true and I think that, well there’s some of that in a lot of economics but it’s not as if all of it can be reduced to plain English.;834;Competencies
No, but I’m probably doing it clumsily, but what I was trying to get to was the idea that, because there is some plain English about it, people feel they ought to be able to sort of get to it themselves even if they haven’t got economics training, whereas they just don’t touch chemistry because it’s too far outside and that lays perhaps Economists open to people feeling, oh I could have understood that, I could have done that.;Yes and also of course economics … and one of the great definitions by Alfred Marshall was that economics is about the ordinary business of life. Economics is about getting and spending and we’re engaged in getting and spending so we all think we know about it and you know there’s a constant belief that you go to a great businessman for wisdom about the economy and that often doesn’t work, that what you need to know to run a business and what you need to understand to make good economic policy are not all the same thing, but people have a sense that they know what economics is about, people have strong prejudices and you know it’s not that easy. My great ideal among the Economists is John Maynard Keynes and he had a spectacularly accurate essay at the beginning of the Great Depression, The Great Slump of 1930 and a little bit of temper shows, that something he says, “economics, don’t know when we’ll believe it, it’s a difficult and technical subject” and yes, you know if you very carefully you can manage to write to make it seem clear, but it is actually fairly difficult and technical when all is said and done.;834;Motivation
What makes a good modeller in economics?;Oh, you know there are many different ways. One of the things you learn, I think this is true of physical sciences as well, is that there are many different personality types who work in distinct ways, so there are people in my style and I’m a ruthless simplifier, I you know pair away everything, I try to make the math disappear and it never quite does but I’m a little model guy, I say here’s this huge complex subject, there’s got to be some little model that we get to the essence of it. Sometimes there isn’t, there are also people who are generalisers, who will look for some general theorems, general ways that you can think about a large subject. There are people who are magnificently good at sifting through large amounts of data, finding ways to process that data, to extract conclusions. You know there are very many different personalities, there’s a certain style kind of identified actually with MIT which is where I did my graduate work which is the little model that cuts through to the essence of a complex problem but there are many different ways you can do that. I think what it does take though is there’s some requirement that you be able to step back and see things differently, say that you know the way that everyone is talking about something is not actually maybe the way we should be thinking about it.;834;Competencies
Yes and that ability to take a sideways look at things is something that you very much used in your journalistic career.;Yes, there is certainly some continuity, being able to say hey, the conventional wisdom about, well you name it, but certainly about economics, but the ability to say that, hey, you know maybe these electricity shortages in California, there’s something funny here, there seem to be a lot of idle capacity, let’s think this through and then saying, you know circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that this market has been rigged and then later we actually found the tapes but that’s very much the same sort of thing, saying you know trade between industrial countries is not about comparative advantage, there is an attitude of mind.;834;Competencies
So the second model that the Prize Committee have quoted is your core periphery model which was also mentioned in 1979 and then further developed in 1991.;There is just a hint of it in 1979. Sometimes I look back at the 1979 paper and say, you know there seemed to be premonitions of lots of later stuff in there. The core periphery model, that’s the love of my life in terms of academics because being able to say that increasing returns makes stuff clump together, that’s not so hard, but being able to get this tension between the forces that pull things together and the forces that pull them apart and that made me very happy when it fell together because it was another one of those things where it sounds very simple but it actually took years of false starts before getting to the point where it actually suddenly cohered.;834;Research
Yes because it sounds as if you were just describing the process of urbanisation which we’re sort of witnessing around us.;That’s right, but no in fact one of the slanders against Economists, people used to say you know this stuff is just circular, you say that things agglomerate because of the agglomeration economies which was kind of the way that people talked about it and say no, actually we can derive those agglomeration economies, they’re about market size but to do it in such a way that you can say, but there are also centripetal forces that gives you some advantage to moving away from where … and then some kind of boundary condition that determines which of those prevails. That was not the way anybody was thinking about it until this new economic geography came along.;834;Research
Right and what sort of predictive capability does the core periphery model give you?;A lot of it is more sort of retro-casting. I mean the model has a story about what would happen and there are three factors that would push you across that boundary to where the centripetal outweigh the centrifugal forces which are reduces transport costs, increasing economies of scale, growing share of non-resource based industries and then you look back and you say, we can see that phase transition in the United States about 1855 when all of a sudden industry stops following the frontier west, instead sticks in the manufacturing belt, so you get that. Initially the core periphery model per se but models derived from it have I think had some successful predictions and one of the things early in the process of European integration, just after I come out with the initial model, began to say, you know the deep integration that’s taking place in Europe, if we believe these sorts of models should actually lead European economies to become more different from each other, in a lot of ways increasing specialisation and low and behold that has happened. So I think there are some successful predictions out of the approach.;834;Research
Right and interventions presumably also that one could think of?;That’s actually less clear. I mean the very nature of the model with the tension between reasons to disperse and reasons to agglomerate also suggest that in principle this is not an invisible hand situation where the market gets it right but it can get it wrong in more ways than one and trying to figure out which way you want to push the stuff is not so easy. So actually, yes I mean there are implications about policy, it certainly means that you should be looking into it but it’s not a simple, you know let’s push everybody into the cities or let’s put everybody into rural development programmes, it’s actually turned out to be quite hard to come up with what the policy implications are.;834;Research
Thank you. Let’s turn from model building to journalism. During the 1990s you became active in writing for a number of different organs and then in 1999 you signed a deal with New York Times for a twice weekly paper column.;Yes. My theory about the time commitment was The Times would be very newly and exclusive commitment that no business consulting, none of the things that middle aged academics do because those all pose conflicts of interest issues, so actually The Times would in effect give me an external backbone to say no to people who wanted me to you know fly off to Singapore and talk to a bunch of Investment Bankers and it’s largely worked out that way, I’m not sure that the drain on my time has been that much more than the other stuff that I might have been doing. But it was different, I think I’m not the first Economist to write for newspapers but the first to take on that kind of regular gig, I think is new.;834;Motivation
Absolutely, and your approach to this production is that you base it around the numbers, your reports are basically based on analysis of the numbers that other people aren’t doing.;That’s right, I mean obviously there’s been a political component and there have been issues like the War in Iraq where I you know took a non mainstream point of view but in much of it, it’s looking at the numbers, looking at the logic. It gets you a long way. Most Journalists, even in the business area, are not really that comfortable with thinking these things through, so I think at least different enough to be a useful voice on the scene.;834;Role of Science
But I mean there must be quite a lot of people who are qualified to look at the numbers but as you say, not that many people who are in the position to have a wide audience to look at what they’re saying.;"That’s right and so to some extent I think there are probably other Economists who could have done this job as well and … service translator. I mean on many issues there is in fact some academic literature and some academic research going on but it’s not known, it’s not getting reported and I can read the stuff and then translate it into English which is not that easy a job actually.
It is a huge commitment of time and also you need to produce, you need to produce quality material at such a pace. A lot of academics like to talk about how even you know the three year grant deadlines and the five year grant deadlines they work on are quite limiting to their ability to think. So having to produce every few days something must be …
Paul Krugman: My running explanation has been that you know your twice weekly column doesn’t have to be Nobel quality research and in fact the Nobel Committee didn’t consider that right. No but it doesn’t have to be something that would startle a trained Economist, it has to be something that is news to an intelligent but non-technical audience, so it’s not that hard and you know if there was a shortage of stuff happening to write about, then I suppose it might be quite difficult to keep the flow going but in these past eight years there has never been a shortage of stuff happening.
But it needs quite a lot of background, you need to be sure of yourself. One of the things that the analysis of the numbers led you to do was to criticise the Bush Administration earlier than a lot of people were doing and so you need to be pretty sure of where you are.
Paul Krugman: Right, but you work on it for a while, I mean it took me about four months during the 2000 campaign before I was willing to come out and say these people are being dishonest, they’re lying about their own numbers. So you get familiar with it and then you work forward and also of course it’s journalism so if you should happen to be wrong, it’s going to happen, if you’re never wrong on these things then you’re not taking enough changes. It’s not like academic research.";834;Advice for young scientists
Yes. In 2007 you introduced a blog to go alongside your columns. I imagine you’re the first Nobel Laureate to have a regular blog?;"I wonder if that’s true, it might be. But you know in some ways I was a proto blogger. Back in the late 1990s I was posting many pieces about the financial crises on my personal web page so in some ways I was a blogger before there were blogs, but then I went away from that because I was writing a regular piece for The Times but in 2007 it became clear to me that there were two kinds of things I wanted to do, fast reaction pieces and things that were more technical than belonged in the newspaper proper, so the blog is a perfect answer to that, a fair number of my posts on the blog I actually just include in parentheses (Wonkish) as a warning that you know my general readers, you really don’t want to read this.
Right and does the blog have a very large audience?
Paul Krugman: I think it does, I haven’t checked lately but I believe I’m you know in the top 5 most read economics blogs or something like that but mostly you know people are aware of it, people in academics but also in the policy world say well you know you have this blog post and what does that mean for what we ought to be doing in this legislation?";834;Impact of the Nobel on you
I suppose one further step might be, now that you’re writing so much about politics, to take political office. I know that during the Clinton Administration you were approached about a job in the Administration.;"Not really exactly. But I was actually in the Reagan Administration which is hard to believe but I was, you know non-political level, I was on the …, the Council of Economic Advisors where I was the Senior International Economist, the Senior Domestic Economist was Larry Summers, don’t know what happened to him. Actually, partly because of that I know what the policy world is like and I don’t think I belong there. I think actually I’m a terrible administrator first of all, so you don’t want me in anything that requires administration and I am not a very good you know negotiator. I like to think I’m a good analyst but I don’t think I’m a good bureaucrat of any kind and you know I might think differently if I wasn’t at The Times but as it is, I have a mouthpiece, people are listening, I probably can have as much influence let’s say on the shape of this coming economic stimulus package from where I am as I could if I were you know the third ranking member of the Obama economics team, something like that. So I think it’s probably as good a position as any.
Okay and so that sort of makes null and void my next question which was going to be, you intend to continue writing for The Times for the foreseeable future?
Paul Krugman: I don’t know about forever but yes. I have to say it’s become in recent months more of an economics column and less political than it had been, partly because we won’t have George Bush to kick around anymore and partly because the economic situation is so dire and in a strange way it doesn’t make the actual workload less but it makes the emotional wear and tear less, so I’m actually finding that I’m enjoying the column more than probably I have at any point in the past eight years.
Because you’ve sort of stood a lot of comment from outside.
Paul Krugman: Well no, certainly there was a pretty fair number of accusations of treason and so on back when I was being critical of the President but now I really feel that you know there was a long period when I felt like I was the voice crying in the wilderness and you know how can you believe these people, they’re trying to sell you on a War and the evidence isn’t there. Now I’m in a position of saying that we have this crisis, here are some things we ought to do and people are listening. Whether they’ll do what I say I don’t know but it’s much less of a feeling of the sort of panic that no-one was willing to look at what was obvious. We’re now having a real discussion, even if my view doesn’t prevail, it’s a real discussion.";834;Career Development
There’s just one other side of your writing I wanted to ask about which are your books because you produce quite a lot of books, some of them are reprints of the columns but others are written as standalone things. What part do the books play in your sort of outreach?;"I’ve had two kinds of books, I’ve had what amount to professional monographs which are useful because sometimes you have a longer story to tell than you can do in articles and so Market Structure and Foreign Trade with Elhanan Helpman back was sort of putting together, integrating the new trade theory work, or geography of trade which was the economicgeography in a longer format, but then the … is you have a longer argument. You know The Times is a wonderful place, lots of people read it but it’s 800 words, you know and those 800 words have to be comprehensible, can’t be too dense, has to start by telling people what you’re going to tell them, then you tell them, then you tell them what you told them and with all of that there’s room for only a core of an argument but no sustained development of a logic and even longer pieces don’t do that, so there’s nothing quite like being able to have a 250-300 page book which actually lays out some longer case.
But obviously very readable because they get to the top of the bestseller lists, people like them, yes.
Paul Krugman: Well yes. Again, I think I write these in English. That didn’t come automatically, I actually started writing newspaper columns way back in 1987 I think for The Los Angeles Times and they were terrible and I’ve gradually learned how to do this.
For the last question I want to take you just a little further back. In 1978 you wrote a paper called “The Theory of Interstellar Trade”.
Paul Krugman: Yes, which is now finally going to be published in Economic Inquiry.
Is it? … and to just encapsulate the argument there.
Paul Krugman: Oh yes. You know I was having those Assistant Professor woes, felling neglected, whatever, so for therapy I wrote this and the idea was that, if you’re shipping goods for long periods over very long distances or certainly in the 18th Century we shipped goods, the time in transit was an important part of the cost, it’s even true now to some extent. The interest costs on stuff on its way on a slow boat from China is an important part of the transport costs. So well, this will certainly be true for interstellar trade where the voyages are very long but the time in transit depends upon the velocity of the observer, so once we take relativistic effects into account, which time shall we be using for the interest costs?
So this is assuming that we achieve speeds of travel that are near the speed of light?
Paul Krugman: That’s right and so you know obviously it was just fun, so I got to put a diagram in Minkowski space time which has an imaginary time axis and so the diagram is blank because if an axis is imaginary, the whole diagram must be imaginary, that sort of thing, so I was having a good time.";834;Environment
It seems that regulation theory and applied regulation in general always tries to capture and control some market inefficiency or malfunction. But it seems this process goes in cycles: At the very moment the regulation is good enough and applied, the market creates a new inefficiency or product and/or learns how to escape from the grip of the applied framework. Do you believe your theory helps smoothen this dynamism in the long-run and how?;I like your suggestion that some part of the business cycle may be driven by evolving change in our financial markets and the need for the regulatory system to adjust with some lag. This is an interesting idea. Mechanism design is relevant to the question of designing regulatory systems, but the most important element in the phenomena that you describe is the great complexity of the evolving financial markets themselves.;837;Research
Is it possible to apply and have practical daily use of the mechanism design theory or similar analytical means in everyday governmental budget planning and execution decisions?;Budget planning and execution involve quantitative measures and benchmarks to guide and monitor agents’ activities, and these are central elements in the analysis of mechanism design problems.;837;Career Development
Is it economically viable to measure the performance of an individual based on the performance of otherwise interested subordinates? Most specifically, I refer to how many school systems budgets are affected by the performance of students, many of whom do not yet fully appreciate the value of education and therefore do not fully apply themselves to their studies.;The problem that you describe, of multiple agents who all affect the same outcome measure, is called moral hazard in teams. Unless we can find ways to measure individuals’ separate contributions, such situations often have free rider problems.;837;Meaning(Values) of Work
Who, or what, inspired you to enter your field of achievement?;My parents and teachers and my friends encouraged and inspired me to work hard throughout my life. Reading Isaac Asimov’s book “Foundation” inspired me to think about a career in mathematical social science.;837;Future research
In one word, can you describe your reaction when you knew you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Grateful.;837;Impact of Nobel on you
Has there ever been a time in your life and/or work when you have doubted what you were doing to the point that you seriously considered abandoning said work?;We all get tired and frustrated sometimes. But I do not remember seriously thinking about giving up my curiosity for questions in economics and other areas of social science.;837;Creativity
Congratulations for your well deserved awards. My question is: Who, of all the other Nobel Laureates in your field, would you most want to meet and why?;Among the Nobel Laureates whom I’ve never met, I would have especially liked to have met Friedrich von Hayek, whose beautiful 1945 paper was so influential in the area where I have worked.;837;Mentors (Role models)
First of all, congratulations! What will you do with the prize money? You have done something extraordinary to win the Nobel Prize – perhaps you deserve to spend it all on yourself!;Thank you. We will not make any big changes in our lifestyle, but will be more comfortable in thinking about long-run planning for retirement.;837;How to Spend the Nobel money
At any given time you obviously have several questions in your mind that you want to find answers for in your research. How do you choose which ones to pursue first and spend most of your efforts on?;You are asking an important question, but it is hard to explain the answer. I tell students that their intuition about what to work on is their greatest asset as scholars, even if they cannot explain their intuition. You may start with a big important question that you know society needs to understand better, and then you carefully take a small part of the big question and try to find a way to make progress in it. Or you may start with a methodological innovation that seems very promising to you, and look for important problems where it can be applied. And always you keep reading about the good work that other people are doing, because that is the most common source of inspiration, if we can see a way to complement or extend their work.;837;Motivation
Mr Grass, German history is absolutely central to the creation of all literature and for me as a foreign reader and for future German readers your books offer a unique opportunity to experience history from an insider perspective. Would you agree that the task of literature is not just to make history readable but also to make it an experience?;"Well, I would be cautious about giving a generalised definition of the purpose of literature. It is not part of the task and yet it is often unavoidable. I have not been able to choose the themes about which I’ve written – they were given to me. The war ended when I was 17. My gift, if I may define it as such, is of an aesthetic nature, a dramatic nature, and that was how I started.
Confronted by this mass of material I was overwhelmed and so it was inevitable. That was just the most recent German history, then post-war history. I have noticed over the years that I have also made an impression as a contemporary author and have done what many authors feel is too dangerous – written simultaneously with events.
Literature is always associated with the temporal distance intrinsic in the past tense of retrospective writing, that is one option. However, I know that, for instance in German literature Fontane wrote his last novel Den Stechlin, and also Frau Jenny Treibel in parallel with events, and experienced the corresponding wrath of the critics.
If a writer does this, writes in parallel with events, he is cruelly exposed to contemporary critics. However, that is the risk one has to take, and it is from this double impulse, by writing in the present as a contemporary yet at the same time also being confronted by the weight and burden of the past, that I have produced my work.
I am also – if I am to generalise and move on from literature – I believe it is impossible to master the future without taking the past into consideration, not purely to live in the present, which at the time is very strongly the case, this makes things one-dimensional, it blinds us and makes us incapable of handling the future.";926;Role of literature
In your books history is presented in various ways, and from different perspectives. For example, you could say that sometimes history appears to be repeating itself. Whereas in other books we find the themes and motifs of slow progress and symbols such as snails, Sisyphus etc. How do these two ideas or ways of grasping history interact in the books?;"Of course it is also a protest against the ideological fixations we have experienced this century. From the communist perspective, the fascist, the capitalist, it is always the same, like fixed truths, things preached, with a single aim, and I write against that. For me the route is more important than the destination.
This enduring labour of Sisyphus and Camus – modern formulation of it, Sisyphus as a happy man living with his stone and knowing for certain that the stone will never remain in its place up there. Or, however, in the turbulent revolutionary or pseudo-revolutionary times around 1968, when young people were very rightfully protesting, I came up with a hypothesis: careful – progress, I’m in favour of it, but it is a snail.
In truth you can achieve a great leap forward as in Maoist teaching, verbally or in another way, but the phase you’ve left out hurries on, it stands still and then it hits back. Those are the things I’ve gathered from my experience and converted into narrative.
However, just converted to narrative, through the change of perspective, through history seen from below, not from the people who made the history, but from the ordinary people that history brings up again and again, unavoidably, and they were turned into fellow travellers and victims and culprits and reacted correspondingly. These have always been my themes, from The Tin Drum to My Century.";926;Creativity
However, your last book, My Century, is exactly the opposite to a normal history book in that you focus on small, everyday details, such as buying ice-skates or the remains of a teddy bear or the significance of winter tyres. Why did you choose to account for your century in this way?;"This is how life is constructed, out of these details, out of these everyday trivialities and superfluities and necessities. And as I’ve already said this is the perspective from which I write.
In a quite pronounced manner in my first novel – in Oskar, just turned three, who sees the adult world from the perspective of the table edge – and thus to this final book. It is a dreadful century, but it is not only the century of great warfare and murderous events but there is also, for example, the development of records, double-sided, the German gramophone society and its consequences.
Then there are always the media, not that I make a great play of this but rather of the people who have been involved in them, in the development of radio or the first German television programme, experienced the influence it has had from this petty bourgeois perspective. These are the things that make me write.
The other great stories have been documented by historians, sociologists etc., but literature can achieve something in a ‘narrative’ way that is closed to the other disciplines.
One thing that is very evident in The Flounder, for example, is the role in the narrative of food and the issue of nourishment.
Günter Grass: Yes, indeed, nourishment.";926;Creativity
And I’d like, it may seem a strange question, but there is in German romanticism a thinker who has also attempted to weave gastronomy into the conceptual sphere of the multigeneric romantic work of art, and that is Karl Friedrich von Romer. He published a splendid book in 1822, Der Geist der Kochkunst. Do you know this book?;"Yes, it has slipped into obscurity again and again. The art of cookery is at the tip of a whole range of themes. What you said at first, and that relates to The Flounder too, the history of our nourishment.
Now we know everything, we communicate, as we call it, around the globe and are an over-informed society, but the chief problem of human existence, the issue of nourishment, has still not been solved.
On the contrary, hunger is increasing, isn’t it? Despite all our resources, we fail in the face of this mammoth task that grows with the increase in the world’s population, and I have noticed that as far as the historical record of this topic is concerned virtually nothing happens.
All we ever have is these great battles, dates, peace agreements, religious schisms, all these things, but what about for instance the significance of the addition of the potato, due to the discovery of the Americas for the masses, as a food resource alongside millet, the potato being a second staple food resource which has also contributed to population increase.
In the main this was not seen or was kept quiet or considered insignificant. Therefore, my very pointed assertion is that the introduction of the potato in Prussia had greater consequences than the outcome of the battles of the Seven Years War. And that is true too of Ireland and many parts of Europe.
Romer claimed after all that culturally all the European differences between Scandinavia, Central Europe, led by France, and Southern Europe can be explained as arising from the differences between butter, stock and olive oil. And that isn’t absurd!
Günter Grass: No, no! Right up to the nineteenth century, right into the prisons, there was the Rumford soup, the soup of the poor and the invention of economical cooking and everything associated with it, and the anticipation of great co-operative kitchens. It was indeed a great economiser, wasn’t it, in the most varied areas. An eccentric character, indeed.";926;Creativity
– Yes, I have a completely different question. You frequently emphasise the power of literature and of narrative, most recently in the Nobel lecture. Do you think that literature and the author have more power than is generally recognised? At least in Sweden – I don’t know if you are in agreement with me – is literature in the meantime regarded more as just a harmless hobby?;"Yes, indeed according to the conventional concept of power we, as authors, are naturally placed at the bottom of the pile. Literature’s effect is delayed, often for centuries, and under the title “To be continued …” it’s not just the sequel but the development of censorship measures that run in parallel. The oppression of literature and the oppression of authors, even up to the present time.
These are all ongoing things, which, however, at the same time reveal over and over again, if censorship measures are taken against them and authors are persecuted, that there must indeed be a hidden power in literature. There is fear of literature. There is a fear of the penetrating effect of this persistence.
That it is not as history officially states, and that we write the history of the losers, whose voices are seldom heard. History is in the main written by the victors, and literature leaps into this gap and is thus uncomfortable.
Even where it really does not want to, or that it takes up themes, thus Ovid is not a result of the Metamorphoses, but when he described his love games, he roused the displeasure of the emperor and was sent into exile. Thus there is definitely no political theme.
A follow-up question: Could this power be misused? You do frequently raise the issue of the writer’s moral responsibility.
Günter Grass: Yes, indeed. I always get a bit annoyed about this, I contradict the tendency we have to look upon the concept of the “intellectual” as an indisputable sign of quality. There is the ghastly extreme right-wing intellectual, for example, Goebbels became an extreme right-wing intellectual. That is hardly a proof of quality.
There are also monstrous demagogues in the field of literature, and there are those failed leaders amongst splendid writers such as Ezra Pound or Gottfried Benn, who were wonderful writers but politically infantile, or influenced in this direction either by their vanity or through flattery, and as a result have caused something dreadful. This is still the case.";926;Role of literature
I think that is very well said. That is why literature has been unpopular with the powerful, because it shows that there is more than one truth. And perhaps it is the case that if writers claim there is only one truth, as for example Pound did, then literature becomes a danger to itself. It damages itself.;"Yes, the prevailing power, always claims that there is but one truth, no matter whether it be the Catholic church with its immaculate conception or just the party that is always right in communism or the master race of fascist ideology or capitalism, which now says: “In the view of the West there is only a free market society and nothing else.”
These are the terrible, single truths that appear as doctrines and finally collapse as we have experienced. Literature arises out of many realities, many truths.
Consider that fine Japanese film Rashômon, in which a story is constructed from a variety of narrative perspectives, in which one says: “This is how it was”, but then another perspective produces another truth, another interpretation and all these different truths build into a reasonably logical picture, yet nonetheless there always remains a mystery.";926;Role of Literature
"Yes, and that is indeed an issue of perspective and the question is: “What has happened?”. And that can be answered in a variety of ways. But it is also the case that if you’ve worked out what has happened, then you have to make a judgement. Again this can be done in a variety of ways.
There was indeed a concept in twentieth century literature, now virtually disappeared, the demonic, that is to say something that is neither good nor evil, that is unclassifiable, and yet remains a power. I am thinking, for instance in your books, of the character of the black cook in The Tin Drum. She is definitely demonic, isn’t she?";"Yes, yes, certainly for the time, on the one hand almost a contradiction that I have used as one of the driving forces for the narration of The Tin Drum, Dog Years and Cat and Mouse. In the fifties there was a tendency in Germany to belatedly demonise the era of National Socialism, as if an earth spirit had risen from the ground and seduced the poor German people.
And that was not the case. It all happened in broad daylight. At the same time The Tin Drum is on the one hand an attempt at “de-demonisation”, I show how such an ideology with all its criminal objectives can build its foundations out of the petty bourgeoisie. And on the other hand this world is naturally riddled with demonic angst arousing forces, like the black cook.
Where did the black cook come from then?
Günter Grass: It’s a nursery song: “Is the black cook there? Yes, yes, yes.” And that is the manifesto. However, in my case, an important factor is that I am very strongly influenced by fairytales. Because I’ve discovered that fairytales contain the most amazing reality. Precisely because of these contradictions.
And through this we have … the romantics, they collected them, and I have chapter openings, once upon a time … and then a totally realistic contemporary story will be narrated. And in the novel The Flounder the Low German fairytale of the Fischer un sine Fru provided the title and determined the conflict throughout the whole book.
On the theme of fairytales may I pose a further question? I would say that on reading your books I sense an affinity with one of the German romantics, namely E T A Hoffmann. Is that really true?
Günter Grass: Yes, indeed. Except that E T A Hoffmann’s books exist purely in a bizarre, self-contained world, whilst for me the transition from bare realism, from which something almost foreseeable has flipped over into the unreal in the middle of a long sentence, and then, finally, reason takes control again, but now the consciousness produced has changed, that is a … I think, that the bizarre is far more dominant in E T A Hoffmann than in my own work.
Precisely this mixture of fantasy and realism is in part a feature of, for instance, Too Far Afield. Would you also agree that this is a result of German readers still being so strongly linked to this reality that they often have difficulty reading the book as literature?
Günter Grass: You could say that. Because here, on the one hand, I delve back into the past but at the same time write parallel with events. Many find that unusual, and on the other hand I have learnt directly from readers through their letters that, for them, through this book, which deals with the past, the first failed attempt to unite Germany under Bismarck through three wars, much has become clear about what is happening at present.
Those are the different timescales with which I work. However, at the same time it is once again about my undeniable origins in the picaresque novel, of course Fonti and his day and night shadows are a picaresque couple, just like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza or Bouvard and Pécuchet in the Flaubert’s French novels, from the fragment of a novel, and that of course leads to comedy and absurd situations.
If, for instance, those in Lusatia stand on the vast, brown coalmines, and I suddenly multiply these two characters, and then it becomes clear how during the communist regime this country was infiltrated by a network of informers, by a duplication, by object and subject, and it is with such images that I like to work.
You do indeed also on one occasion compare this relationship, precisely this relationship between the informer and the person informed upon with the relationship between a priest and his …
Günter Grass: Yes, yes, that, however, has been greatly misunderstood …
“We are spending our whole lives in the confessional,” Fonti says on one occasion.
Günter Grass: Yes, I’ve broken that habit. Always it was the image of the informers wearing their leather coats and looking sinister, that was certainly there too, yet of course the spies of the welfare state are far more dangerous. They say: “I am your friend. Therefore I’ll protect you so that you do (not) fall for the propaganda of class enemies.”
And just like Fonti experienced it in relation to the day and night shadows, where it is difficult to see through it. Where is the welfare, where is the spying, the boundaries have become fluid and that is what I’ve portrayed.
Yes, censorship has sometimes previously been in the form of artistic guidance to the writer.
Günter Grass: Yes, yes. But we are always forgetting the scope of literature, for example, I notice that you are an admirer of German romanticism, aren’t you? Friedrich Schlegel and Brentano, they did part of the Metterlich groundwork toward the end of their lives, and even converted to Catholicism and became terribly bigoted.
This was a hideous discovery for Goethe, as he suddenly noticed how these young people towards whom he had harboured a certain goodwill, became irrational in middle age and converted to Catholicism, of course fanatically as is the way of converts, and he found that very irritating.
Many of your literary characters are also Catholics. Could you say a few words in relation to them?
Günter Grass: Yes, yet also about these Dog Years, the on-going change in ideological dependency, this interplay also plays a part. Sure, I was brought up Catholic and know the stench of the Catholic Church. I moved away from religion early but the impression remains.
You have said that in some way you write aloud, you walk round the room and so on. Is it also the case that somehow you can hear the voices of the characters and you try to listen in?
Günter Grass: It is a wonderful thing in the process of writing when such paper characters are first sketched, and when one is doing good work, from a certain point in time they come alive and start contradicting the author as well. I find that the author is then no longer at liberty, once this is afoot, he may try to lead them on a long leash but they have a will of their own.
I remember when I was writing The Tin Drum, I had the totally misguided idea of giving Oskar Matzerath a sister, and he just wouldn’t have it. There was no space for a sister, yet I had the character of the sister in my head. In fact I used her in later novels, in Cat and Mouse and Dog Years, Tulla Pokriski. However, had Tulla Pokriski lived, and Oskar, it would have destroyed the novel. He protested and it went no further in the manuscript. I have to bow to the will of the fictitious characters and, I find, that this is wonderful for the writer and invigorates the writing experience.";926;Creativity
Derek Walcott, welcome to the interview. You were the Nobel Literature Laureate in 1992. Tell us where did it all start? What unique combination of circumstances gave Derek Walcott to the world?;"I’m from the island of St Lucia in the Caribbean in the Lesser Antilles, the lower part of the archipelago which is a bilingual island – French, Creole and English – but my education is in English. I went to St Mary’s College. I was writing from a very, very early age. My father used to write. He died early and my mother was a schoolteacher so my academic background from childhood is a strong one, a good one.
And your ancestry, is it typical of the Caribbean?
Derek Walcott: Yes, a mixed African and Dutch and English, which is probably typical of Caribbean, everybody’s got some mixture of something.";933;Impact of the Nobel on you
And what does that bring to the culture? What does that bring to you as a writer?;"St Lucia, which is where I’m from, changed hands from treaties about 13 times, so it might have finished off as a French as opposed to an English island. It’s just the last treaty that made it English, like Martinique, which is its neighbour, or Guadeloupe. What that does is it gives you a bilingual situation, a bicultural situation, very strong African presences there in terms of the rituals, Catholic religion, African rituals and the music is very strongly influenced by African rhythms but of course one studied English literature so all that melange was very fertile for me.
There is a contradiction in the perception of your culture.
Derek Walcott: The usual thing is to see the Caribbean mainly as a tourist place with hotels and waiters and stuff like that and it is, that’s its economic direction, unfortunately, that it has to develop tourism as an industry, so there’s a clichéd perception of the Caribbean as a place of, you know, usual thing, Calypso and steel band and beaches and so on. All of that’s there and it’s true, there isn’t much interest, though, I think in the real Caribbean which is small and negligible in a way, so it’s the Caribbean writers and artists who have made attention happen to the Caribbean, that aspect of the Caribbean, not just the tourist aspect of it.
There’s a recurring theme in your writing.
Derek Walcott: No, the risk that it takes is that it takes a risk of humiliation and embarrassment, in other words if you’re insisted on as someone who should always be hospitable, always smiling for tourists and so on, that’s like a given rule, you know, that is a kind of more benign slavery in a sense, you know? So there’s a big risk of thinking of the Caribbean as a tourist resort, encouraged in a way by government policy of hospitality, but hospitality can be almost taken too far sometimes so I still look out that there isn’t the kind of degradation in that kind of service. I don’t think it’s that bad, but I think it’s risky and of course a lot of the real estate that happens in terms of hotels is often encouraged by the government at the risk of, say, neglecting the needs of the Caribbean people in terms of the villages that are near to beaches, big hotels that are near to poverty. It takes a very delicate balance for it to work.";933;Motivation
You write very lyrically, very beautifully, the landscape of the Caribbean, you describe it very, very well but there’s always this tension, so does that give you fertile ground for your writing? This dichotomy, this tension?;"Yes, because again the smallness of the place as that you write, especially in my island, can lead to a very isolated view of oneself. In other words a fisherman, say, working on a beach doing his job, may be photographed by a tourist because it’s photogenic to see him working and the Caribbean is extremely photogenic so poverty is photogenic and a lot of people are photographed in their poverty and sometimes it’s kind of exploited. The poverty can be exploited sentimentally in terms of presenting certain images that are good for tourism, you know, a happy native woman holding up something, a smiling waiter, all of those sort of clichés that one has to avoid, I think it’s almost a duty of the writer to protect the people from that kind of cliché exploitation of them.
In the Caribbean, do you have a readership?
Derek Walcott: I don’t think poetry has a readership anywhere, really, that’s that big. If you go to, say, a poetry reading at the Guggenheim Museum or the YMHA, the full audience might be something like 400, 500. Well, you take a place like New York, with so many million, that percentage of people attending a poetry reading is very, very small and proportionally talking in terms of having a poetry reading in the Caribbean in which you may have 100 people, percentage wise there are more people at that poetry reading in the Caribbean than there at the Guggenheim.";933;Creativity
You started, you published very early, you wrote very early. Do you consider yourself a natural writer?;I always knew what I wanted to do, which was to write poetry from young, very young, and then later plays, so I knew my vocation extremely early mainly because, I think because of my father’s death, early death, and my mother’s encouragement. My dedication to trying to be a poet started very, very young and I was very well encouraged by good teachers and by older friends and so on, so I think it is a benediction and I also think it is a calling, a duty. For me it was, definitely, and that’s the only thing I knew I wanted absolutely to do from extremely early so that I thought I was blessed as well, too, in fact that I was learning in a society that hadn’t had much expression particularly in terms of English verse, so it was tremendous excitement to paint and to write that early and trying to find out, you know, who you were, what you were trying to write about or who your, people that you are living among are.;933;Motivation
And what developed and nurtured your literary voice?;My mother was extremely encouraging because she knew my father wrote. My father used to have amateur theatricals done in which my mother was an actress, evidently and his friends and so on, so he had a very small courtier of people devoted to poetry and theatre and stuff like that. So she knew, it wasn’t a surprise to her that I would want to, or my brother, to pursue that calling and to try to be a writer in the Caribbean at that age and, you know, at that time was extremely, well not courageous but a little odd to say, you know, in St Lucia, that you wanted to be a writer when there are no publishing houses and no museums or galleries and so on, but it was good to do it because you were beginning something, you were at the start of something, I thought.;933;Motivation
And further to that stimulus, to the stimulus at home and from within your community, a lot of your writing has very sort of deep classical allusions. You’ve written ‘The Odyssey’, you know, you’ve reinterpreted it in your writing so what academic career did you pursue?;"I have to always defend this idea that I re-wrote ‘The Odyssey’. I think it would be a stupid endeavour to try to do that, so that’s not what it is. It’s a book that has to do with the references, in other words, our references to the classics or to religion or to anything is referential. It is not the direct thing. I mean, our names, our customs and so on, came over the Atlantic and the fact that the Atlantic has an archipelago called the Caribbean and that the Aegean has an archipelago called the Aegean, both are geographical parallels. They’re not cultural parallels, but any fisherman out at sea is an Odysseus and any sort of heroic figure on a beach is a Hector or an Achilles so that these are references. There’s no point trying to do a template of ‘The Odyssey’, that would be a futile exercise. I mean, Joyce did it but he did it with a complete plan of, you know, moment by moment copying of ‘The Odyssey’.
My point of the whole play, of the book, is not to do it in black or to do it in Caribbean, in another language and to use the figures because none of the references are accurate really. They’re all referential, they’re all accidental and therefore they are what we have in the New World which is a sort of half referential, half real reality that someone, an Indian who has lost, you know, India by travelling across, you know, the Indian dispensation of arriving in the Caribbean loses that ancestry too and what remains is a fragmentary memory of accidents and associations and I think that that’s the description of the, not philosophy of the cultural experience that I’m trying to describe. So that it’s not a copy of, it’s in no way a copy of ‘The Odyssey’ to do that because the references are not exact. They are, as I said, referential, they are associative rather than direct.";933;Motivation
Is that a privilege that you have, coming from a culture with such diverse origins that you can draw on the association of so many different sources and so many different traditions of …?;In a way it’s a misnaming of things rather than a naming so that if somebody sees a black fisherman, you know, striding across on the sand and says: That looks like Achilles, right? He’s obviously not Achilles. The fisherman doesn’t know that he is supposed to be Achilles or anything like that, but the reference that one has made is a carryover from a previous culture whose echoes are carried over into the Caribbean and I think that’s true of Caribbean literature as it is or Spanish-American literature, that these references, these back of the head echoes, are what we try to describe in the New World, not as it was in the Old World, but something associative of the Old World that is there in the New.;933;Creativity
What is the African influence in your writing?;I think the African influence is in the melody of my voice, I think it’s there in the music that I like, certainly in the plays it’s very strong because it’s a society of percussion, it’s rhythmic in its essence and in the theatre particularly I try to capture that kind of quality that is there in the pulse of the country.;933;Creativity
When you write plays, what audiences do you have in mind? You have the audiences that is going to read your dramas but performance must be a very important part of that?;"Yes. Obviously, I’m very well educated, I read, I write. Consequently, I’m a big difference from someone who is maybe illiterate coming into the theatre, if one can get them in, so that the audience that exists in these islands is not a brilliant sophisticated audience but it’s the best kind of audience because you have to go after it emotionally. You have to move them in the same way that an opera, which we don’t understand, moves us, but they may not understand even the metaphors that are there. Not the metaphors but certainly the language that may be there, but they can be moved by the beat and sway and power of what you’re hoping to write, even more than, say, a naturalistic, you know, three act play in which there’s a linear kind of exposition of something which is rational.
And I prefer to go after something that has more vehemence and more vitality and even if it is not understood but has, in the way that an opera has a visible narrative line, that you can be moved by speeches. I never wrote, I’ve never written down to my allegedly illiterate audience and the fact, the duty to move them is stronger than if I had to do, you know, a play in Stockholm, which has happened, or a play in London or New York. I feel more responsibility to move these people than I feel to try to move an audience in a box like set, you know, in any one of these cities in which you are, you’re going to the theatre and you’re really in a shut box and there’s no sense of light and exhilaration and so on that I like to try to bring to my plays.";933;Creativity
In the prelude to your collected poems, there’s a passage: “Until I’ve learned to suffer in accurate iambics”. What does that refer to?;"Well, that’s a very early poem and I guess what I’m saying is I’m beginning to write and I shouldn’t say anything until I’ve learned how to scan what I’m writing, the technique of writing. The craft, really, is, master the craft and then you can say something and that’s what I’m saying to myself as early as I can.
And where did you go to master this craft?
Derek Walcott: How does a poet teach himself or herself? I think chiefly by imitation, chiefly by practising it as a deliberate technical exercise often. Translation, imitation, those were my methods anyway.
And when do you break away from the roots? Break away from that tree and become truly creative and original?
Derek Walcott: I don’t think I’ve ever tried to be, you know, deliberately original. I mean, there’s a great thing that Pasternak said which is something that I quote often, that I’m not calling myself great, he just says that great poets don’t have time to be original. It’s a great remark. But what one feels, one is part of a huge body of work that you’re trying to contribute to which is on unanimous experience called poetry, even globally and even historically, that there is a thing called poetry which is fed by different languages and your language feeds into that and whatever the language is, there is a limited number of good poems always. There’s always one small anthology of the best poetry that stays the same size for centuries, I think.";933;Creativity
Your fellow Laureates on the podium last night have a passion that, to some extent, has been forged and fed by struggle against injustice, by personal suffering. Is there an element of that in your writing? Do you feel a passion that is fed by your awareness of the injustices in your world and in the black world, in the African world?;"Well, see, to say ‘the African world’ is to confine the experience of the Caribbean strictly to Africa. I don’t like that because I think you have to include the Lebanese, the Syrian, the Chinese, all those people who, from the Mediterranean for instance, have come to the Caribbean, or the Barbadian convict, it is all part of the totality of the Caribbean experience. The emphatic experience probably has been Africa but there’s an equal balance in Trinidad, of say the Indian experience, and I think it’s a duty of the West Indian writers to take in all those different cultures and manifest their experience, even if it may be African or Indian.
I think there’s too much of a separation that goes on now, even, in Caribbean literature of Indian, Chinese and so on and that really the amalgam of everything is a complete experience of everybody being exiled and arriving here and trying to do nicely here, I mean in the Caribbean, and trying to forge something out of it. So that the emphasis, I think, has been very African in the Caribbean, but I’d like to see more presence in Caribbean literature of, say, you know, our writers vary in colour, we have some very good young white West Indian writers, all right? Who shouldn’t be excluded from the idea of the African so called Diaspora because they’re white.";933;Creativity
"You talk about the rhythm, the percussion of Africa, of the Caribbean; you talk about that sort of cadence that comes into your writing. Is there a continuity into the present that you pick up through reggae, through hip hop, through a constant evolution of poetry?";Not so much poetry, I don’t think. I think more music, I think, you know, there’s a lot of poetry coming out of Jamaica, that kind of sort of public poetry. That goes on, like rap and stuff like that, you know, but I think you have to kind of make a distinction between poetry and that kind of performance because very often it is too monotic, too boring, you know, too repetitive to the industry, I think. But I think in the theatre that the young actors, for instance, we have a group of actors coming out of that background who can take in the idea of playing Shakespeare as easily as if they can do a rap number, so that mix is great.;933;Environment
Is there a valuable contribution that is evolving all of the time? That adds to the body of influence, though?;I think the manifestation, as always in literature or culture, is music, what’s happening to the music? And what’s going on in Caribbean music is, I think, pretty phenomenal because it takes in all these different strains and makes it one thing. I think I like Zouk a great deal because it has polka in it and it has reggae. It’s sort of a amalgam, which is what the Caribbean culture is and that’s manifested in the music, so in that sense it can be made theatrical by manifesting it physically. To have that … I think what’s happening, I think that presence, that combination of different sources and different elements mixed together which some people might think as degenerate and corrupt because it’s not authentic and steady, but that’s the manifestation of Caribbean experience and it is that multi cultural and multi faceted and great for a writer, experience a playwright.;933;Creativity
Are you a very sensitive observer? How do you as a writer get into the human experience and express it through different viewpoints and different characters?;"The novel tends to do that more than, say, theoretically the poem, although you can do it in long poems, so I’m talking about the technique of whatever you’re doing and what you’re using to justify, you know, your existence as a writer. And the theatre, I think, does that because the joy of the theatre, of course, is to have a new people to write about, the Caribbean people, and to write about them not only on one level of, say, the tourist level of the level of the forest or beach or whatever but also to examine a little more carefully what the Caribbean middle class is about. We need more plays of that kind, that examination of what is the structural conflict that, not structural conflict but the cultural things that can go on in the class war that happens which is more real than, say, a racial context. A class examination of what is happening in the Caribbean now, I think, is an exciting subject.
Have you written about this? What of your writings explores this particular theme of class?
… what I try to maintain is the melody that’s my own melody …
Derek Walcott: I write in verse, so I don’t think I’m moving from poetry when I enter theatre so that I try to have the same complexity that you might get in a poem as you might get in, say, the equivalent of a dramatic aria of someone talking, so it is for me a matter of meter as much as it is a matter of structure so even if it’s middle class language, what I try to maintain is the melody that’s my own melody, the way I’m talking now, and how far it can carry itself into something that may be metaphoric or, you know, discursive and its manifestation in terms of dialogue and that’s there, I think it’s an extremely enriching place to be for a writer now.";933;Creativity
Is it accessible? Do you feel that your writing is accessible to a broad audience or, as you say, is it, you know, poetry readings don’t attract huge …;"No, it’s not accessible at all, in fact it’s far from accessible because first of all the subjects that I’m writing about are not of interest to anybody on Broadway. They don’t care about the life of a black fisherman, you know, if that’s what I’m writing about, or the life of an Indian woman living in the country or something, because those are not box office subjects. So we have to be, we have to move away from the possibility of hoping that, you know, you’re going to have a hit on Broadway in which you’re dealing with peasants or backward people or under developed people so that’s that theme, that possibility just has to be erased and fact is good because then you don’t take your theatre in that particular direction.
You take it in the direction it should go in the reality of what you’re writing about, but the temptations are there and the temptations remain, the Hollywood temptation and the Broadway temptation and the commercial temptation. It’s there for the novelist as much as it is for the playwright. You know, you don’t sell sonnets to Warner Brothers for production but it’s also, in a way, it’s there for the poet as well. The great threat is that whole commercialisation of art that has happened in the 20th century because people can make tremendous fortunes from writing, with luck. They can, you know, and sometimes I think that particularly in America, that’s very present in terms of a young writer who can make a tremendous fortune if they have a hit book, a hit you know, anything, so that’s a dominating fare that’s there.
Since that’s not present in the Caribbean, then you feel freer to do what you want without always being haunted by the idea. You know it’s not going to be a hot, there’s no chance of it being a hit, so there’s a little more likelihood of one being a little more truthful to the experience than glamorising it into something that might make a lot of money.";933;Life
So you consider that sort of predominant commercialisation is a threat to integrity?;"More and more, yes. I can only say the obvious in terms of television or what television does, not to the audience, but to the writer. I don’t think there’s a writer in the 20th century who can escape the idea of a hit, of making a million dollars not deliberately but by accident, even, you know, that that possibility remains there and it grows more and more corruptible in the sense that the, you know, we now pay actors $20 million to make a movie. That’s a budget of a small island, you know? So the sense of proportion is very threatened everywhere.
You write epic poetry. You wrote ‘Omeros’. I mean, that is not a popular current form at all.
Derek Walcott: Yes, I wish they’d make a movie and pay me 20 million though. Despite what I’m saying.
What lies behind that? What stimulates you to sit down and write epic poems?
Derek Walcott: I don’t like, I’ve said it before, I’m not crazy about the word epic because it has such a pompous echo to it. It’s a long book and I guess it’s epical in the sense that the Caribbean experience has been epical, the middle passage is epical the, you know, Indian journey across from India to here, the piracy, the different things that have happened in the Caribbean, but what that particular book, what made me want to continue daily and enjoy working on it every day was, the propelling thing was celebration.
I wanted to celebrate the island and the people that I knew so at the back of it there was a joy of responsibility in doing it that, you know, made me want to get up in the morning to work on it. Plus, of course, the form. The form was exciting because I had to write rhyming hexameters alternating with whatever, you know, in a terza rima design, you know, it was a challenging thing to do and it was, because it was formal in that respect, then it was exciting to get up to do it. I guess like going to play golf. I don’t play golf, but it must have been the same thing every day.";933;Research
What do you say to a potential reader?;Well you hope, in a work like that, you hope that you’re engaging the reader and this is very pompous but I mean in terms of delight, in terms of giving delight to the reader. I don’t think that’s something that’s around now. I mean, I think poets now don’t give delight to readers, they give responsibility. They make things very hard for the reader and it’s like a test, it’s an examination. Nearly every poem you read now is like an exam, you know, try to work out what it’s saying.;933;Role of Literature
A few more things, the Nobel Prize, of course, I mean, you talk about having a hit. How did you get to find out that you were a Nobel Prize Laureate and what was your reaction?;"I had heard rumours about it the year before I got it and that tends to happen, I think, to candidates. You know, their names keep coming up. I forgot exactly now, but somebody called me, obviously, and they called me early in the morning and I was at home alone and it was a shock, a very pleasant shock. Sort of a shock. I kind of thought well maybe, yes, it could happen, you know, and when it did it was from that day on the pace of being a Nobel Prize winner increased tremendously. I mean, as Czeslaw Milosz once said to somebody who had won the Prize, I’m sorry for them, in the sense that the harassment is not a good word but the press, who dutifully have to do what they do, like call you up and find out and all of that, so, I mean, the phone was interminable, it just kept going and so on.
On the other hand, though, you recognise what a tremendous honour it is and what good it can do or has done or could do for Caribbean literature, you know. It was not for me only but it felt like it was doing something for what has been happening in Caribbean writing and Naipaul is a candidate, an obvious candidate that I have nominated anyway. As much as I don’t like a lot of the stuff that he writes, but I have great respect for him as a writer, so I would nominate him every time it came up that he would be nominated and I’m glad he finally got it, even if he behaved a little stupidly once he did get it.
So did you see yourself at that point as a standard bearer for Caribbean literature?
Derek Walcott: No. What did happen, though, was extremely moving. There was great celebration and what one had to do was to separate yourself from the celebration in a way, that you had to make yourself, translate yourself into the third person, right, like, oh they’re applauding him as opposed to, you know, oh they’re applauding me or they’re creating something around me. You’ve got to eradicate the me and make it a third person thing for the sake of, I think, the Prize is given to the idea of poetry as much as it is to the poet himself, to the perpetuation of poetry is what I think the prize means.";933;Impact of Nobel on you
Finally, young writers, do you have something special that you can say to aspirant young writers?;"I teach at Boston University and I have young poets that I am supposed to be guiding in certain directions and I’ve always have a lot of pleasure and pain too in trying to direct them in certain ways because it’s very painful sometimes to see a young artist trying to shape his or her life and to wonder what to tell them, which is in a way what, you know, you try to do in the sense of saying you better make very sure that this is what you want to do because it’s going to be extremely demanding and you probably will give up and that’s sad because eventually they do give up, some of them, because different things come into their lives.
Often for young women it’s marriage and sometimes I would say, you know, get a boyfriend who understands what you want to do but don’t give up what you’re doing for the boyfriend or for the husband because this is a calling and that’s the, not penalty, but that’s the thing that comes with the calling and the same thing might be true of a young man, saying that, you know, especially if you want to do poetry all your life and that you think this is what your life should be, it’s very painful sometimes to look at that happening under your tutorship.
So it is a calling? You need to be prepared to sacrifice?
Derek Walcott: In a way, the ones who aren’t called or driven, when they give up, it may be best that they did give up but sometimes I have seen those who should not give up surrender from time, from other things that come in their way, you know, the concept of, say, being a writer and making a living off a writer, especially a young playwright, it’s very, very hard for young American playwrights, extremely hard. There’s no body of production to support them. There’s not a state theatre, there’s no provision for, well there’s social security, I guess, but I mean it’s not like Europe where you can have an idea of a candidacy of being a playwright in a state theatre and so it’s abysmally lacking here. Very frightening.";933;Advice for young writers
From what origins did Nadine Gordimer come to be born in a gold mining town in South Africa?;"The usual sort of background for whites in South Africa. My mother came from England and my father came from Latvia.
Is that typical white middle class type of background?
Nadine Gordimer: No, what I meant was that almost every white person, for perhaps a generation, two generations, even three generations before, they come from various parts of Europe. So mine is not the background, it is just one of a number.
And what was the sense during your youth, during your childhood; did you get a sense that you were part of an elite that owned South Africa?
Nadine Gordimer: It went without saying, if you could call what my background was an elite. It was a small gold mining town, but of course, being white in South Africa, up until the change came and till we got our freedom, to be white was to be automatically belonging to the ruling caste, no matter how humble you were as a white.
And did you feel that humility at the beginning?
Nadine Gordimer: No, I didn’t feel it at all, because it’s natural for a child to accept the milieu in which he or she lives. I went to a convent school. Of course it was also gender restricted as well. So I went to this convent school. Everybody was white; the other girls were white. On Saturdays when you got your pocket money and could go to the movies it never occurred to me, as a child, I think, or to any of the others as a small child, that there were no black children there; black children didn’t go.
Q… without that library I don’t think I would ever have been a writer …
The most important thing was that the local municipal library … My mother read a lot and she, having read to us, my sister and me when we were little, by the time I was six years old I was inscribed in the children’s library and that library indeed I still regard as my principle source of education, because without that library I don’t think I would ever have been a writer, because the only way you can become a writer, the only training is to read and if I’d been a black kid I couldn’t have used that library.";934;Creativity
At what point in your childhood did that realisation come, that you were part of a privileged elite and that there was an enormous imbalance?;"I think it came in, you know, in less formal terms, it came from experience. When I walked to my convent school across the veldt, on the left was one of the big mines, the Springs mine, and there was the compound where the black mineworkers lived and they came from all over Africa and I was always warned, now you know don’t go anywhere near the mine boys. So you were instilled with the fear of blackness even though there was the black maid of all work, nanny, whatever in the house, but of course she was a woman. She was black, but at least she didn’t seem to represent the sexual threat that has always existed about white attitudes towards black, what they regarded as a threat, as if every black mineworker was waiting to jump on some ugly little 10 year old schoolgirl. But to be serious about it, there were the mine concession stores.
The mines would build a row of little stores and they would rent them out as a concession to local people who wanted to run them and the idea was to keep the miners from going into the town. So that I would pass these stores and then I would see how the mineworkers, many of them still in their semi travel dress, blankets and so on, and what have now become dreadlocks but were just the way they wore their hair, coming along and they would want to buy something. Now the counter, there’d be a counter and there would be a wire across it; strong wire, kind of fence between the shopkeeper and the customer and the customer would point at this or that and the owner of the shop would take it down and then the black man, he couldn’t try anything on, he couldn’t touch anything to see whether it was what he wanted. He would have to push his money through and then he would get the goods. And child as I was, I suppose 11, 12, I couldn’t help thinking this is strange, because when I go with my mother into town and I’m buying a pair of shoes or a dress or something, we go into a little booth and we try it on. Why do these black people just have to point something, they can’t even look at it and see what it really, what quality it really has. So it was incidents like this that made me think about the difference.
Also the question of liquor raids. It was of course at that time, I’m talking about the ‘30s now, late ‘30s. It was forbidden for blacks to buy liquor and so people made their own beer everywhere, all over the place, in the backyards of white houses and when I was a little older, I think about 11, then there was a raid one day. I woke up, my parents woke up. We went out into the yard and there were the policemen, white and black, turning out everything in the servant’s room, in this old retainer of ours we’d had since I was two years old, turning her mattress over, pulling her clothes out, looking for beer and my parents stood by, didn’t say “Where’s your warrant to search? You walk into my property.” It was simply accepted and so was a humiliation of the woman and indeed, one of the first adult stories I ever wrote came out of that.
Only two to three years later when, at the age of 15, I wrote a story which indeed appeared in 1939, the year the war broke out, in a journal, a literary journal in South Africa. Nobody knew that I was a child, but the fact that I’m wanting to point out is that this was such a traumatic thing that I saw, with this woman, that these two things together that I described to you, began to make me think about the way we lived and why we lived like that and who were we to have the privileges that nobody else had if they were the wrong colour?";934;Family/Home Environment
Do you think that once you began to recognise that injustice, that humiliation, you began to sort of piece together a more three-dimensional picture of black South Africans as opposed to the many South Africans who either supported or ignored apartheid, who never really let black people come into focus as real people to them?;"Yes, but I think you have to look at the circumstances. It was unthinkable for me to meet or know black people who would share my interests, with whom, in other words, there could be some sort of natural rapport and meeting. It was always on the servant/master basis and even if you were the child of the master or the mistress, you still had this particular position, but being troubled about it and, great reader as I always was, beginning to find out that there was something called racism that existed in the world and I was living in it, I was part of it.
… so I met one or two black people, with whom I had far more in common …
And then when I was older and went very briefly to, took the train every day and went to the university, and there for the first time I met, even then there were one or two, there were a few young blacks. Remember the university of course was whites only, but there were certain courses that were not available in the black universities and then, as a concession, at graduate level, post graduate level, a few blacks would come in and so I met one or two black people, with whom I had far more in common than I had with the young whites that I knew in the town.
I wasn’t sporty. Many of the things that they did were of no particular interest to me and here were young people, black, who were trying to write, who were beginning to write. So we had this enormous, not just ambition, we had this enormous way of approach to life and the mystery of life and social questions in our own lives and then I began, at that age, to make black friends. And then as I, myself, became a young published writer, then I moved into a different circle, which was, again, journalists, actors, people in the arts who normally indeed don’t follow the rules, the conservative rules, and where the feeling about the incredible distortions of racism, not only the oppression of blacks, but the distortions in your personality, in your mind as a white, these became very much part of my life and indeed started my way to freedom from racism, from racist ideas that I’d been inculcated at school, at home, everywhere since childhood.";934;Creativity
You know, there was the recognition of the injustice. There must have been the anger that you felt. What nurtured and fed your voice?;Well, I suppose that did, and then, of course, it meant that this extended to the times when people who said what they thought got into trouble and if you were black the consequences were dire. So that your connections, which had been personal and through the arts, became political and your friends got into trouble and you found yourself having to, indeed, when questioned by the police to tell lies, to say that you hadn’t seen them or you didn’t know them. Apartheid made fantastic liar out of everybody who was against it. You had to in order to your friends and others to survive, never mind yourself. So that the two really then developed together.;934;Dealing with difficulties
You have a whole generation who grew up under apartheid whose children are now getting a different kind of education. Is there a sort of a generation gap which doesn’t offer the type of support that is necessary to nurture young writers?;"Yes, but this is nothing to be distinguished by colour. Black children and white children, they come home from school and they turn on television and the bedtime story doesn’t exist. You put the kid in front of the television and turn on the kiddies programme and that’s that. You don’t read to them anymore. And when you’re being read to, probably you are, you’re young but you’re of a generation where you read to probably, and then you begin to look at the words and want to recognise them for yourself and you become literate. We have an enormous problem of illiteracy. We have very high illiteracy and I put it down to the fact that people have got no access to the joy and the pleasure of books. Having to read a particular book in school is one thing, it’s a task, but to amuse yourself and to let you enter into another world, that’s really something different, but of course that is becoming almost universal. I was reading the other day how in England and in America the functioning literacy, the standard has dropped.
So you moved beyond the sort of particularities of apartheid. You see that as a universal problem?
Nadine Gordimer: Oh yes, this has got nothing to do with apartheid. This is the threat of the image against the word, the written word, the published word in a book.";934;Advice for young writers
Your early writing, The Lying Days, was that a sort of coming of age, a realisation of … the first articulation of your understanding of the society around you?;"I had been writing stories, which indeed were looking at questioning how we lived and then that first novel, it’s the only thing I’ve ever written in my 14 novels, in my nine or ten books of stories; it’s the only autobiographical thing. I’m not a writer who uses her own life. My writing is widely ranged in terms of who is the central character, whether it’s in the first person, whether it’s in the third person, whether it’s a mixture of the two, but I’m not an autobiographical writer. But the first novel, like everybody’s first novel really, had lots of autobiographical elements in it and I think the first novel is usually some kind of revenge against your background and, you know, you’ve got to get it off your chest.";934;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
You write from very, very diverse points of view, very diverse characters, diverse situations. You write about gender, you write about sex, you write about injustice, you write about race.;"But I write about it from within. I don’t write about it. I write about how it shapes the people who are shaped by it. To write about it is to write nonfiction, to write essays, which I have done of course, but in my novels and stories they’re not about …
You write very much as an insider, from very diverse positions. I’ve just been reading some of your short stories in Loot. For instance “Mission Statement”, you know, it’s a very, very intimate portrait from within a particular situation, from within somebody’s life. How do you manage to get under the skin of such very, very diverse characters in diverse situations?
Nadine Gordimer: I can only say I don’t know. I really don’t know.
But is there a process, because obviously you display an intimate knowledge in that case of the world of an aid worker. Do you actively set out to experience and get into these situations, get to know these kind of people?
Nadine Gordimer: No, I’m not a journalist, I don’t do this, but of course I have known, in my long life, a variety of people and, as I’ve said, there is this curiosity about other people and also the alertness to what they are thinking or doing and the way that they give away their real feelings. But I can’t explain it, and I don’t think any writer can explain it. It happens and of course there are some people who, and there are some occasions in your life when there is one of your characters is going to be engaged in some particular aspect of life, about which you don’t know very much, so then I, others may enjoy this, but I have to force myself, very reluctantly, to go into what is called research to make sure that I haven’t used the wrong term or whatever, but that’s pretty unlikely. For instance I could never write an historical novel because I haven’t the capacity, the ability to do the research that is necessary.
Education. You attended Wits University. You didn’t graduate.
Nadine Gordimer: No, I was only there for a year doing occasional courses.";934;meaning of work
Isn’t that rather unusual for an author of your stature that you have, you know, the process has come from within? How have you developed yourself as a writer? How have you developed the powers of language, the descriptive powers, the idiom that you have created? Where does that all come from? Is that just hard work?;"Books, no from reading. From reading since I was six years old, truly.
Is that a real discipline?
No, the reading was never a discipline, you know, an enormous pleasure …
Nadine Gordimer: And living of course. No, the reading was never a discipline, you know, an enormous pleasure, an unending pleasure in my life but one can’t explain it. I suppose the love of words comes into it but then where do the words come from if you haven’t had a long academic education, which I certainly didn’t have. I don’t know. Would I have been a different kind of writer, I sometimes ask myself, and, on the other hand, I often see in academics’ fiction the stiffness and the set of academic language coming in. So maybe I was lucky. The only thing I really regret is that I would like to have studied languages, more languages.
Other languages?
Nadine Gordimer: Oh yes, I mean obviously English is my own but just to have studied foreign languages and not to have learnt an African language. So like most other South Africans, there I am sitting with my black friends and we’re all talking in English and then I may go out of the room perhaps to get a bucket of ice or something and come back, we’re having drinks together, and they have broken into their own language. They’re talking Setswana, they’re talking Zulu, whatever, and I am then a stranger in my own country and among my own people. So that’s a great regret in my life.";934;Motivation
For many years a lot of South African culture, art, performance, writing has been informed very much by the struggle against apartheid. Is there going to be a kind of liberation in the arts where people are able to confront and express more personal, more intimate, more self discovery now?;"I wouldn’t like to see literature turn inward. I wouldn’t like to see it contemplating its own literary navel. The change is so extraordinary and as a new generation grows up in totally different circumstances from those that I, my children or my children’s children would really know, there is so much unexplored, there’s so much of the mystery of the way we love to be explored now and I am waiting now, not quite so patiently anymore, to see some of this expressed in young writers at present.
I wouldn’t like to see literature turn inward.
There’s some people who are writing very well but they’re obsessed by the past. It’s particularly black writers and it’s more understandable then because the weight of all that was on their backs, holding them down, changing the lives of their parents and grandparents and so on.
Changing, what am I saying, they were not changed, each one was exactly like the one before. Then this seems to be something they want to express all this. It’s the return of the repressed in Freudian terms, but it seems to be happening with whites as well and there’s been quite a rush of books, it’s the breast beating book. Oh, I couldn’t help it, my parents were racists and so, you know, and I was always uncomfortable about it. This is something that you should go to your psychotherapist for, not bore everybody else with it. This is not to say that white experience is irrelevant, of course it wasn’t, but I’d love to see much more of what is happening now, because to me little things are they’re not so little. They’re little incidents but they have huge social implications.
Near where I live there’s a primary school, which of course was always white. Very nice school, not too big. Now, if I walk past there and it’s break, lunch break time, the kids are coming out, they’re smallish because it’s a primary school and it still gives me a sort of start when I see two boys, a black boy and a white boy. You know how you’ve all wrestled, you were a boy and it’s natural for little boys to kind of play battles, wrestling with one another, but this is a white and a black. This was unthinkable even in my children’s time and then go to a play or to a movie and there you have a mixed couple; a black/white couple on this side, you have two blacks there. This gives me a shock of pleasure.";934;Creativity
You compiled this extraordinary collection of stories from very distinguished writers and this is a global statement. Can you tell us a little bit about Telling Tales?;"Well, now it’s I suppose 15 months ago, there were, and it continues of course, these wonderful big musical events, mainly pop stars, musicians and singers but also some of the classical musicians as well, but mainly the pop stars, holding these enormous gigs where they have enormous performances, where indeed they raise money for the cause of HIV/AIDS sufferers and, at the same time, made people aware, roused people’s awareness of this pandemic disease and did a lot, I think, to give a shove to the whole problem of denial and the shame that people feel is attached to having contracted the disease. And I thought, well fine, there’s Bono, there’s Geldof, there’s everybody else doing these things, what are the writers doing?
PEN, the international organisation of writers, which has been wonderful over 30 years and continues for writers who become politically oppressed and indeed hunted down by various regimes, it’s still going on in some places. They have done wonderful work there but there hasn’t been a peep out of PEN about HIV/AIDS, and you would think that they would know writers who had succumbed to this. So I thought, well it’s no good going on grumbling about it and saying why doesn’t this one do something, why doesn’t that do something? Well, what can you do as an individual?
So out of the blue I wrote off to 20 writers and said: Look, I have this idea, would you let me have a story?
So then I thought, what about a book of really lovely stories, wonderful stories. There are plenty of books about HIV/AIDS, textbooks and manuals to help you if you do contract the disease and so on. But these should be stories that are not on that subject at all and, quite commercially, go for big names, wonderful stories and try and get them published at a time, especially near Christmas when people are looking for gifts, but in other words to have a book that people will want to buy for themselves and give as a present. So out of the blue I wrote off to 20 writers and said: Look, I have this idea, would you let me have a story? I didn’t write to people who were mainly novelists because I don’t think that bits out of novels work very well. So I wrote to them all, from the five Nobel Prize winners and a lot of others, and from Woody Allen to Günter Grass and John Updike and, you know, everybody whose stories I think are really wonderful and I admire.
The response was marvellous. I didn’t get one refusal and they all sent me these wonderful stories and then of course publisher. I went first to my own publisher in America and said, look, I don’t know how you’ll feel about this but will you publish this book and will you take only production costs? You will not get a penny of royalties, the writers are not going to be paid and all the money will go indeed to the Treatment Action Campaign since we are such a heavily infected area and Treatment Action Campaign of course now, as you know, works quite a bit in the surrounding territories as well, and to my astonishment they were very pleased, said we’ll do it. My English publisher the same and now I have 14 publishers worldwide. It’s just come out in Greek; I got it the other day, a copy of it. It’s come out in German and indeed it’s on the way in France, in Italy, China. You name it, it’s all over the place. Russia.
It’s a fantastic effort. I haven’t read all of them but I’ve loved what I’ve read so far.
Nadine Gordimer: The stories are really lovely, so the people they buy it and, at the same time, they have the great pleasure of knowing that what they’re enjoying is also helping other people, but I don’t know how to thank enough the writers who generously gave what we have, you know, our talent and the publishers, after all they’re business people, and 14 publishers agreed to this.";934;Creativity
To get back to the Nobel Prize. Tell us about it? I mean 1991. Did you get a phone call, you knew that you were on the shortlist? What was the procedure?;"Well, I’d been on the shortlist for a few years, as you usually are I think, and journalists would phone me and say, you’re on the shortlist, you’re probably going to get the Nobel Prize, what do you think about it? And I would say, if I ever get it I’ll tell you, goodbye, and put down the phone. Finished. And on this occasion I happened to be in New York for another reason and staying with my son. I got up before anybody else did in the apartment because I wanted to call somebody in London and when the time difference, you know, was convenient, but as I went into the kitchen where the phone was the phone rang and indeed it was a Swedish journalist who had found out, through a friend in Sweden, where I was and phoned to tell me that I’d got the Prize. So that was really out of the blue because I think that year, probably because I was away, no-one had phoned and said you’re on the shortlist again.
How did that feel? How has that affected your life?
Nadine Gordimer: Of course it’s a wonderful thing to get because it is the premier prize in the world since it’s not just one country. I’ve also had the Booker but was for Commonwealth and people who get the Pulitzer here and so on or the National Book Award, you’ve got to be an American to get it and that’s ok, these are national prizes, but the Nobel, that is both, its strength and some people would say its weakness is that it looks at books from all over the world in all languages.
I’ve come to the conclusion this is a very, very good thing. For instance someone whom I now consider, and I should have long before but he didn’t exist in translation sufficiently for me to have noticed his work, that’s the Portuguese writer, José Saramago, who is a very great writer and suddenly it’s announced he’s got the Nobel Prize and I’m saying, who, you know, never heard of him. Then of course the translations came out and I realised what a wonderful thing that someone who was not widely known now is recognised worldwide in so very many languages.
Does that give extra force to your voice? You get a bigger readership, you get the recognition?
Nadine Gordimer: You know it’s a very moot point about readership. Probably the readership thing is for the year when you get it, for the most recent book, but then after that, you know, it’s a line on a cover. I don’t think it makes all that much difference. More and more writers are expected to be performers so that if you have a new book out, if it’s a good book of course, if it gets well reviewed, then you must be going round talking about it and being on talk shows and things. So that side of it comes into the sales.
More and more writers are expected to be performers …
But changing your life. You mentioned it gets you … Of course it gives you a voice, shall we sa,y that is likely to be listened to a bit more. So for instance, in the case of Telling Tales, it probably helped me when I wrote to the writers and it helped me with the publishers to get this off the ground and then of course you get invited, my god, I think they don’t even know what kind of Nobel Prize you’ve got. So you suddenly get invited to open some conference on saving the whales or whatever, you know, in various parts of the world. But, on the other hand, it does give you a voice when there’s something that you care about, that you want to give some push to.
And of course every year, once you’ve got it, you have the privilege of absolutely confidentially, only to the Foundation, of putting up, nominating someone for the current year. So since ’91 … it’s absolutely confidential. People send you their books and say, could you please put me forward and so on, just ignore it. Since ’91, and I’ve made use of this privilege each year, I’ve had only two successes and that I can tell you because they got the Prize. The first one was the great German writer, Günter Grass, and the other was Kenzaburo Oe, the Japanese. So I don’t know, it’s a very low average.";934;Impact of Nobel on you

Please, just go to the library and read.

What did you feel when you knew you had won the Nobel Prize for Literature?;"I felt extreme happiness as well as great astonishment. I never expected to win the prize. During my time Nobel was awarded to writers of the highest calibre like Anatole France, Bernard Shaw, Ernest Hemingway, and William Faulkner. There were also Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. I had heard that an Arab writer might some day win the Nobel Prize, but I greatly doubted it would happen.
Mohamed Salmawy: But did not writer Abbas Mahmoud El-Aqqad nominate you to the prize 20 years before you won it? This was during a television interview in which he said he believed you deserve the Nobel Prize.
Naguib Mahfouz: El-Aqqad was always courageous in his thinking.";937;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Did winning the Nobel Prize in any way influence your life and subsequent work?;"Yes, it encouraged me to continue writing. But I received it at a later stage of my writing career, unfortunately. The only thing I wrote afterwards was Echoes of an Autobiography. I am now writing Dreams of Recuperation. Even the novel Qushtumur, which was published in serialised form in Al-Ahram was written before the prize. It appeared in book form afterwards.
On the personal level winning Nobel imposed on me a life-style to which I am not used and which I would not have preferred. I accepted the interviews and encounters that had to be held with the media, but I would have preferred to work in peace.";937;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What made you become a writer and who inspired your career?;I started writing while I was in school on copy-books.

What has been the impact of your works on Egyptian literature since you won the Nobel Prize?;The answer to this must be left to the critics. Only they can say whether my writings influenced Arabic literature or not.

I heard this from Russian visitors, as well as from Germans who came to Egypt to invite us to the Frankfurt International Book Fair for which they were preparing at the time.;937;Impact of Nobel on you
Let’s start right at the very beginning. What were the circumstances of your birth, your early upbringing?;"I was born into a Christian household, in a parsonage in fact, so I grew up in sort of a missionary atmosphere but it was an environment which involved both the traditional religions as well as the Muslim religion, so we were exposed to all the various facets of faith, micro cultures which existed within those beliefs, and even though I’ve lost whatever Christian faith was drummed into me as a child, I still maintain very good relationship with all the various religions.

Wole Soyinka: Ake, Ake Abeokuta, I was born in the Ake sector of Abeokuta. Abeokuta is a nation city, it means literally “under the rocks” and it’s a very rocky kind of environment and very lush, lots of greenery, of course, because it’s a very tropical belt. It is a small town with the monarch, the Alake of Abeokuta, a mixture of traditional and western kind of cultures. My father was a schoolteacher and so I had the advantage of both western educational instruction in the school, as well as what you might call the process of imbibing the traditional processes of education instruction around me.
And this was colonial Nigeria. What were the forces that shaped the society?
Wole Soyinka: First of all it was a society which was very deeply steeped in its own cultures. Those cultures were never eradicated by contact with the missionary society. It was also a birth place of a lot of political agitation. While there was a pretty reasonable harmonious co-habitation with the European, the British specifically, British colonial forces, there was also a very keen sense of nationalism. In fact, the Egba kingdom, which Abeokuta is more or less the capital city, the Egba kingdom was one of the very last to be ceded to the British protectorate. It remained almost an independent entity within what is now known as Nigeria, simply because of its own traditional structure of governance.";939;Family/Home Environment
You talk about political agitation … You talk in some of your writings and in your Nobel Lecture about the very, very young experience of your mother participating in a tax agitation against what was perceived as a very unfair tax. Did this political agitation, this very overtly political life, influence you from a very early age?;"There’s no question at all, I grew up with a very strong sense of what is just and what is not or, to put it this way, I grew up with a keen sense of a division, the reality of a division of perception in people’s lives between those who govern and those who govern. The Alake of  Abeokuta, for instance, was a revered individual, traditionally, was a powerful monarch and the institution of Obaship. Many people don’t understand this outside, but actually the Yoruba system of Obaship, that’s kingship, is really a pretty democratic one. There are severe limitations to what a king can do and not do. There is a council of chiefs who wield a lot of power, they’re like a cabinet and if the king misbehaves or uses excessive power, this Ogboni council can actually meet, the enclave can meet and dethrone him. So the kind of autocratic notion which people have about Obaship, your system of kingship or that applies in other parts of Africa, of course, but this Yoruba is the example we’re dealing with, it’s not quite as rigid as they imagine.
When the Oba became somewhat high handed, autocratic, imposed what the women considered an unfair taxation on them, they rebelled and their protest was organised principally by my aunt, Mrs Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, and one of her lieutenants was my mother and I was fascinated by the conflict. I was interested in the causes, and I found myself on the side of the women, maybe I got moved into it because my mother was involved, but I think I understood sufficient about what was happening and I became the courier between various groups, demonstrating groups, and I got really caught up, physically and mentally, in the entire conflict and I’ve no doubt at all that early lesson left its mark on my political awareness.";939;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
Your life has been defined, punctuated by political incidents, some more benign and some very cruel and threatening, even to you personally. Can you describe some of that process?;"The process of decolonisation was a very untidy one. The British, when they were leaving finally and knew exactly who they wanted to take over, they wanted pliant government, figures, structures, they wanted to continue indirectly in effect their control over much of their colonial possessions and this was one of the very early causes of conflict. The British inclined more towards the feudal mentality, the feudal structures rather than the more radical progressive elements who would re-shape society and institute pretty egalitarian systems of governance with opportunity for even disadvantaged people and so I found that decolonisation was not just the end of political struggle.
There always are internal divisions which impose choice on citizens and those who were politically aware and so I found myself thrown into that division within bound society in the west of Nigeria especially and I wrote, used street theatre, we call it guerrilla theatre, wrote political sketches, performed them in open spaces and halls in which corrupt authority was attacked and this led eventually to even more activist action.
There was the incident where a radio station which was the result of my intervention in the attempt of the government to rig the elections and pronounce, you know, broadcast totally false results after inflicting violence on the voters, after intimidation failed completely and so I intervened in that. This ended me my first spell, you know, of conflict with the law because I was tried for allegedly holding up a radio station and substituting the Premier’s state with mine, which more or less invited the Premier to get out of town sort of thing, but I was acquitted and then later things got even more serious. We had our first experience of a military coup which was very bloody. There were reprisals, there was a counter coup and all this led to a civil war.
I consider the civil war very unjust because the breakaway state of Biafra, I mean the conflict led to Biafrans, the Igbo people breaking away from Nigeria and while I thought that this was politically unwise, I found that it was not morally wrong because they had been decimated. There’s no other word for it. It was an act of genocide which was perpetrated against the Igbo people. The causes, of course, are more complex than straightforward right and wrong but you could not escape the fact that there was an act of genocide and so I took position against the war, I allied with others who were like minded and we tried to intervene.
This led to my imprisonment for two years and four months, nearly two years of which was in solitary confinement, so that was like an escalation of risks, escalation of intensities of the cause of conflict. Then, after that, when I thought it was more or less all over, everything was stabilised, we were moving up to serious military dictatorships which were not acceptable but with which you had to live and even trying to obtain, keep something useful for the nation, for the people, with the more amenable of these, the less obnoxious of some of them. Then the move towards democracy began all over again and suddenly it was aborted and aborted by a very singularly repellent kind of military individual and so I had to take action against him also which led eventually to my exile, my being placed on trial for treason, a price being placed on my head and so on and so forth. Part of occupational risk of one’s endeavours.";939;Creativity
Has this process been part of your perceived duty as a writer or as a citizen?;"The problem with literature, with writing, is that it works sometimes in terms of correction of social ills. Other times, it just does not suffice. The proof of that is the ability of a dictator to snuff out the life of a writer as happened to my colleague, Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Ogoni environmental activist who was hanged after a kangaroo trial by this brutal dictator, Sani Abacha, he and eight of his companions. When an event like that happens, and even lesser events of lesser gravity, the citizen comes to the fore, the citizen overtakes the writer because literature has proved or is proving inadequate and then forms of citizen action, whether it’s demonstrations or sometimes, in the case of Christopher Okebo, another colleague of mine who lost his life, that’s, you know, he went to war, he went on the Biafran side because he found that his poetry could not answer his sense of intense wrong and he perished on the front.
So writers throughout the ages have one weapon, which is literature, but they also have their responsibilities …
So writers throughout the ages have one weapon, which is literature, but they also have their responsibilities as a citizen when literature does not seem to suffice. I mean, they are not mutually exclusive. One continues to write anyway but if you are called out to demonstrate, if people are being killed in the streets, it’s hardly the moment to go for your pen and paper, you know, help in one way or the other.";939;Motivation
It’s a very intense fire in which your craft, your art has been forged. Has it had a very powerful affect on your writing? Has it made your writing more intense?;"Could be. One thing I am certain of is that it has made me create and recreate different tempo or different tempi of writing. I’ve had to adjust to … I mean, ideally, for instance, I think most writers would like a quiet space, complete isolation, in which they control their own time. Spaces of creativity in which there’s very little interruption. I think that’s the idea and this perhaps is how I began as a writer, finding that space, that intense period in which I’m completely alone, completely alone.
But as you get drawn more and more into other activities, like political activities, very demanding, you have to find different rhythms of writing; I think that’s the word I’m looking for, rhythms of creativity which then, of course, become very intense. I think your writing then tends to be very intensified simply because there are other demands which seem equally important. You know, if they were just trivial demands and so on then it wouldn’t matter at all, you can hive off a certain section of the mind and deal with that, but if it’s something which consumes you, then there’s a competition which concentrates your writing.";939;Environment
Did you find it easy to start writing or was it a struggle? Are you a natural writer?;"That’s a very good question. I think I’m a very lazy writer and by that I mean that I do not battle, I don’t struggle too hard against it. If I have difficulties in the writing, I just go and do other things. I don’t feel a compulsion to write. Of course, when I start writing then it becomes a compulsive activity, because I’ve begun something and I want to continue, want to finish it. The characters in my play are crowding my head, demanding to be let out or demanding to be allowed to complete what they’ve set out to do, so there is compulsion there and of course I can carry an idea with me in my head, it just is there for months, years.
I remember doing ‘The King’s Horseman’, when I first heard of that story, I wanted, I was so fascinated by it, I wanted to write it immediately but I didn’t have time for it and other things came in between. Then one day I was teaching in Cambridge, and this is a play which is set in a colonial period, and my college was Churchill College and I used to come down the stairs, you know, towards the dining hall or going outside and there was this bust of this great genius of a colonialist and all the more hated for being such a genius at his work, at that kind of work, Winston Churchill.
I used to look at him and I felt each time like pushing the bust over the edge of the stairs and it was during that period that one day I recalled this story which had been in my head for – how many years? Maybe five, ten years, yes, about ten years and I sat and after that I just couldn’t rest until I could sit at my typewriter then and start work on it and that’s where I wrote it and wrote it, for a play of that complexity, virtually record time. Within the week I’d completed it and I brought people in to read it, so writing comes like in … it has its own creative rhythm, you know, you can’t force it. At least I don’t. I know there are other writers who sit down religiously every morning, they take their espresso, they put a clean sheet of paper there and they sit looking at that paper until they’ve finished or covered at least a number of those pages. No, I’m not like that. I have to be ready. It has to gestate it for quite a while and then it’s ready to burst forth.";939;Motivation
Is that part of your African tradition? Because obviously you’re writing for very diverse audiences and audiences with diverse literary capacities. Some of your audiences may be completely illiterate. Is it important to you that you reach all of those audiences and is theatre a strong vehicle for that?;"That’s where I think those of us who work in the theatre have an advantage over the novelists and the prose writers and, to some extent, those who write only poetry. With theatre, you can interpret the most complex play on stage for it have meaning to an audience because you’re dealing in images, you’re dealing in action, you can use different idioms to interpret and clarify something which is obscured in the reading and of course there are different kinds of play, there are mythological plays, there are what I call the dramatic sketches, direct political theatre which is virtually everybody, but I find that you can use the stage as a social vehicle, you know, which any kind of audience.
And when you have already the tradition of theatre in your society and we have these travelling companies, we call them folk opera companies, they travel all over the place in a lorry; they arrive there in the morning, they drum, dance around the town to announce their presence. In the evening, to say where the venue will be, it can be just an improvised hall. By evening everybody’s already, you know, swarming in that direction so the tradition of theatre already exists in my society and that is an advantage.";939;Creativity
Does it give you a special joy to have your work performed in front of a Nigerian audience, say the Orubo audience?;"Joy is not the word, I don’t think, it’s just that’s my occupation, you know, I come alive, let’s put it that way, I come alive when I have assisted in bringing out the printed word on the stage, you know, and I enjoy directing plays. It’s a tactile process, theatre, unlike a number of other forms of the creative work.
You talk about diverse audiences, diverse influences?
Wole Soyinka: My understanding of the creative process is simply that all cultures and all concerns meet at a certain point, the human point in which everything is related to one another. That has been my creative experience. I never know who’s influencing me at any time. I mean, I can take a play by Brecht and adapt it, I’m consciously adapting that play, or, as I’ve done with the Greek classics, Euripides and Oedipus, and I’m consciously adapting that play. Whether it influences me or not, I think it’s the critics, the analysts who have to decide that. Me, I don’t feel that I’m under the influence of any such sources.";939;Creativity
You draw lots on your Yoruba culture, you draw a lot on Ogun, you draw a lot on the cosmology of your people. How does that distinguish your work from other writers?;"Mythology can be used, and has been used, even to re-state, you know, the very urgent problems of the world. At a reading which we had, Derek Walcott, Nadine Gordimer, Toni Morrison … Once Derek Walcott read a play of his which is based on the Cyclops myth. Intensely political play with direct correlation and purpose to the Greek tyranny in the episode of the Greek General, but I also rarely use mythology for its own sake because, as a theatre person, the mythological figures are in fact humanity to the ninth degree and Yoruba mythology in particular has fascination of being one of the most humanised mythologies in the world.
The gods in Yoruba mythology are not remote at all. They’re benign, they’re malign, they are mischievous, like Eshu for instance, tricksters, rascally, fornicators, that’s a similarity to Greek mythology, for instance, you know. They’re not saints, they’re not saints. They’re powerful. It’s why they’re not tyrannical. Of course, a number of them are also very, you know, benevolent, you know, there are saintly virtues to be found in them. In other words, you have the entire gamut of human experience captured in the mythology of the Yoruba. This is what makes the Yoruba mythology a natural source material for me in my creative endeavours.";939;Creativity
Do you feel a duty, do you feel bound to give a voice to your community? Yesterday at the reading you talked about reinforcing the civic voice.;"Yes, I do. I do, but I were part company with certain schools of writers that I do not believe that it is necessarily the duty of the writer. I don’t believe that. If a writer is true to his vocation, to his or her vocation, the very process of creativity enlarges these human horizons. It provides insights, even when you’re not writing, when your writing’s not dealing with a concrete political situation.
The very function of creativity, of the elaboration of the human condition only enlarges the human spirit and, I mean, as a writer I don’t want to read political literature all the time. It would be terribly boring and, you know, abrasive, but just reading the insights, you know, partaking of the insights of a writer into phenomena, into society, into human relationships, both on a micro level and on a macro level, is already a function. For me, a writer is already being the deuce of his mission, his occupation to society. But I happen to be unfortunately temperamental. No, my temperament is also, what you describe to rainfalls, the will of society, to combat a number of contradictions. That happens to be my creative temperament.
When did these issues move away from specific to universal?
Wole Soyinka: I think all, well … no, let me correct what I was about to say. I’m very conscious when I’m being specific, like my street theatre, my guerrilla theatre for instance. It’s created and the themes and the methodology of the delivery of the content is specific. It’s to an immediate issue. But when I sit down to craft a play or a novel or a poem, I’m now dealing more consciously, perhaps, perhaps, on more universal issues. But even those specific issues contain sometimes universal applications, so I don’t say I’m only going to be specific but what motivates that particular work at that moment is a specific issue and I try to address it as much as possible.";939;Creativity
In literature. Tell us about the event. Did you have intimations beforehand? How did it all come about?;"No. Not only didn’t I have any intimations, I was extremely irritated the year before by speculations in the Nigerian media. I mean, it really boiled up to a hysterical pitch. I believe that prizes are useful, you know, are useful things for the disciplines, whether we are talking about chemistry or we’re talking … It motivates, it, you know, inspires, it encourages and it brings, in the case of literature, it brings literature, the arts, it brings the arts out of the ghetto, out of the ghetto. People respond … “Oh there’s a prize for this? Oh yes. Oh, I must take a look into that.”
But as a matter of fact, I was nominating other writers. During that period where, in my group, the institution to which I belonged, we moved between … and Senghor, Léopold Senghor, and I frankly thought that one or the other was going to get it and we were going to celebrate with them. So my mind was never at any time, at any time, you know, on the notion of considering myself as a candidate just, you know, because I had other writers I loved, and not just African writers. I mean, like, I’m a consumer of literature and so I had candidates quite apart from even the African candidates whom I thought, you know, who are going to get it before they got to me at all. So it was quite a shock and a surprise. Pleasant one, but the shock was the same.";939;Creativity
The event itself, your Nobel Lecture, you used the platform, it was a very overtly political speech. It was a very powerful lecture and there was, among the more conservative elements in society, there was some grumbling about using that platform for such an overtly, and I come from South Africa and of course at that time the reaction was fantastic because it really put the apartheid government into a flap, you know, it disturbed them.;"I have been obsessed by South Africa since, oh, way back. My very first play which was put on at the Royal Court Theatre in London as a student, I wrote it as a student, was called ‘The Invention’ and it was a racial thing but I felt my racial fount was being sullied and insulted as long as, you know, the apartheid situation existed. It just didn’t make sense to me. There was no way I would not have used that platform, you know, I couldn’t conceive. My mind immediately shot to South Africa the moment I sat down to think what I was going to write, what I was going to say. There was no other choice.
I wasn’t interested in discussing my craft. I mean, South Africa had always been mixed up with my work, with my literature, so you can talk about South Africa, I am talking about my work, my play ‘The Invention’, other poems I had written, the very issue of creativity. I was speaking about the whole fate of literature, the exiled South African writers with whom I used to mix in London and other places. /—/, Lewis Nkosi, /—/ etcetera. I mean, for me this was literature. I had no ambiguity at all about what I was going to say. I wasn’t that I felt it was my duty. No, it was just my literature.";939;Impact of the Nobel on you
Do you think that that lecture had a powerful influence? Do you think that it has contributed towards changing things?;"You know, I was so impressed when you said just now that it really had the South African government in a flap. I didn’t follow, you know, up the consequences or whatever, I was always more interested in looking forward to the day when, as I wrote in another article, I would present a copy of Mandela’s poems, ‘Mandela’s World and other poems’, and I swore that one day I was going to present it to him in his living room and read him one or two poems.
So once I’d given that speech, well for me, I was more interested in doing other things in the same connection and maybe that and the work of others, cumulative effect, political bargaining. I wrote, if you remember Ogun Abibima which was a construction of Ogun, moving down to the south to join hands with Shaka, both mythological figures, one is real of course but in a sense, two ancestral figures, you know, joining hands to go down and smash apartheid and I wrote this epic of projection … so I just went back to my work, I continued my work.";939;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How has being a Nobel Prize Laureate affected your work, your writing, your creative space?;"Let me again cite Bernard Shaw, who is reputed to have said that, when he was given the Nobel Prize, that he could forgive the man who invented dynamite but it took the most diabolical mind in the world to invent the Nobel Prize for Literature. I agree with that to a certain extent because it swelled my constituency. It was already sufficiently, you know, swollen because I’ve always, you know, agitated on the world stage one way or the other but it really made life virtually impossible. It’s with astonishment that I discover that I’ve actually completed a new work, you know, ever since the Nobel I would sit down and look at it like some strange object … Oh, did I really manage to finish this?
So it’s mixed with … Of course I’ve enjoyed having the Nobel Prize, the prestige that goes along with it, the money that came with it in particular. I was the typical, still am to some extent, impecunious writer, you know, just struggling to make ends meet, so that, you know, nobody’s going to deny that at all. In fact, if they want to give it to me a second time, I’m standing by, ready to receive it, but as I said now, it’s a problem, it’s a real problem and then expectations and then you have monsters like Sani Abacha who come up from time to time and who would have died a happy man if he’d succeeded in hanging a Nobel Laureate for literature. I mean, that’s a fact and it can be attested by some of his close associates so it brings, in this particular case it brought certain additional risks when it should have been what most people correctly think, a kind of protection.";939;Impact of Nobel prize on you
It’s a new century. You’re writing ‘Climate of Fear’, you’re addressing very current issues. You’re addressing a new threat. Can you tell us a little bit about the last lecture in here ‘I am right, you are dead’, it talks about intolerance.;"Yes, intolerance has become, I think, the reigning ideology of the world today, the intolerance versus intolerance and it’s taken on lethal proportions. I mean, intolerance has always been with us, you know. The moment you have ideology, we have intolerance, whether it’s the secular ideology or, you know ideocratic ideology, which always brings with it some kind of intolerance. But the sense of self assuredness that, you know, ideologists, you have all the structure of the world in your hand, whether you’re viewing it from material world or from the extra terrestrial lofty position and it’s become accentuated because of genuine as well as perceived injustices.
Religion has really spawned some monsters. It always has, historically. Go all the way back to the Inquisition, you know, the Crusades, the Jehad and so on. It’s all based on the mentality of “I’m right”, but now today it’s moved from even the question of “I’m right and I’m willing to tolerate those who agree that I am right or those who don’t disturb me anyway”. Now, it’s a question of “If you do not accept that I’m right, I have a right to kill you”. That is the mentality of religious fundamentalism today. That is the meaning of the kind of terror which we are witnessing today, that everybody is expendable who do not actually physically line up behind me.
And one of the most distressing aspects of this is to see that kind of mentality also manifested by the leadership of so called democratic countries, and I refer specifically to the United States of America, where the President uses a kind of language which becomes indistinguishable from that of Osama Bin Laden. “I’m right, it doesn’t matter whether the world thinks I am wrong, I know that I am divinely ordered to do this”. It’s that kind of language, that’s the language of intolerance, intolerance of opinion – those who are not with us are against us, you know. And this is, of course, we’ve got to be honest, that the more dangerous is that of religious fundamentalism, those who feel that, you know, the kind which led to Beslan, one of the most horrendous chapters of Iraq’s contemporary experience. That really, I think, has reached, has breached the very barriers of the unimaginable.";939;Creativity
People seem to have a very short memory for history, that things recur over and over again in an endless cycle. Do you think that your role as a writer is to try and help people to understand, to deconstruct history?;Whenever that is possible, I consider it my duty to do. Whenever circumstances point, reactions, events point to this short changing of memory, then I think it is the duty of the writer to say: Look, the material we’re working on, whether citizens or writers, is not new, you know, and to bring the mind back and see that there’s a repetition of this cycle of stupidity. I think I’ve used that expression somewhere else before and to think now why do we have to tread the same spores over and over again? It’s almost a kind of self defense. You’re saying you’re making my work as a writer difficult for me because you’re not paying attention, you’re not recollecting and I have to keep reminding you, so yes, I think even from the point of view of self defense, one must bring up, you know, pull up memories from where it’s short changed.;939;Role of Literature
Finally, you teach as well, you have young aspiring writers. In short, what do they have to do?;"I always tell them get ready a basket first of all, in which to collect all your rejection slips and you must continue until that basket is full or your work is accepted. In other words, you just must continue writing; and once you accept that, then we can talk about what you want to write insofar as I can assist. I’m not a very good teacher of creative writing and I always warn them about that. What I teach is literary criticism and comparative literature and so on and that’s my function, but from time to time it’s possible for me actually to help a writer. I read something and something strikes me then, I feel I can talk to that writer about it.
But over and above all, I also tell them don’t get carried away by the ideologs. Don’t feel that you have to tailor your literature a particular way to please any school of ideology. There will emerge in its own right, effortlessly, some kind of ideological direction which is a reflection of your thinking and you want your thinking, above all. We wasted a lot of creative energy in that immediate post colonial era, when there was a struggle between, you know, the Cold War between the capitalism and communism. Many writers just wasted their energy and their talent because they want to be ideologically correct and of course all they produced was propaganda. Absolute tawdry uninteresting, oh, full of excitation, yes, you know, full of ra-ra-ra but they were short changing their own talent and I used to tell them and now that they’ve become ideological orphans, they’re now trying to recover their own true voice and have produced some very good work but they could have produced excellent work and at the same time, you know, be truthful to their ideological convictions if they hadn’t allowed that ideology to take primary place and that’s what I tell all writers.";939;Advice for young writers
How did your writing career start?;I hated school, to be honest with you, really. I had very, what do you call it? Grades, in Norwegian. I couldn’t write, the teachers said, but still I wrote for my own pleasure, to put it that way, from a very early age. I think the first I wrote was lyrics to songs I wrote. Then I wrote small poems and small stories, and it gave me a kind of happiness to do that. I felt a kind of peace, I was safe, I was by myself, I could express anything. ‘Express’, that’s not the right word, but at least write something. It was bad. I read some of these texts and it’s really bad writing.  They’re very poor, but still, they gave me a kind of feeling of safety or something, and I thought that they came from a place inside me somewhere. I don’t know where it is, but it’s in my body somewhere, not in my brain, nothing I invented or something, and 50 years later, I’m still writing from this same secret place inside me. Such secret places, perhaps it’s better not to know too much about them or try to figure out exactly what it is, but it is.;902;Motivation
What inspired you to start writing?;"I started out quite early, playing the guitar a lot, and even the violin I tried, but I managed badly, but the guitar a bit better. I even played in a boys band, and we became that good that we played at local dances. I think I was 14 years the first time, and to enter such a place you had to be 16, so I was too young for it all, of course. But I was very, very much into music in my teens or early teens, I would say. For reasons hard to explain, I stopped writing and I even stopped listening to music, and I started writing. I think somehow what I tried, when sitting there with an old typewriter, was to create the kind of mood or atmosphere or feel that you had when you were playing music. All these repetitions I’m famous or ill-famous for, they came, I guess, from music, from playing.
I both played in this band an electrical guitar, but I also learned to play classical guitar and small pieces of Bach etc, I could play. But then – all over. You ask me why, I think partly because I never became a good musician. I rehearsed and I rehearsed, and I rehearsed, but somehow I didn’t manage to get on a good level. Although others I could compare myself to, they were much better musicians than I was. Perhaps because of that, as simple as that, it might be. Then I ended up with the writing in place of playing.";902;Motivation
How would you describe Nynorsk, the language of your writing?;"To me it’s very, very simple. When I first started to learn to write the language in the first grade in school, I started to learn the right Norwegian. That continued until I was … we called it ‘gymnasium’ in my days, the last grade before university or something. All my teachers were writing Nynorsk, all of us, so it was simply my language and is simply my language. I can do a lot in my life, like I’ve been saying, but I cannot leave that language, I’m not allowed to do that. And I don’t want it for sure, it’s as I said, that’s the sound, my dialect is very, very close to written Nynorsk actually.  When I, for instance, hear the voice of my grandmother, I can well hear it in Nynorsk, but it’s quite impossible to hear it in Bokmål. That sounds as a quite different person, so basic experiences are, of course, very connected both to the landscape and to the sound of the landscape, to put it that way. It turned out to be Nynorsk was supposed to be a language for the whole of Norway. It ended up being mainly a language for the western part, Vestlandet, my country, as I often say.
The reason for that is partly because it resembles the most the dialect spoken in this western part of Norway. You have basic traits of spoken Norwegian that are common in Nynorsk, not common in Bokmål, so you can broaden this a lot if you want to, and there are good reasons for that. But the way people experience it, they experience it as their own language or a language close to the way they speak, mostly in the western part, and in the eastern part, close to the western part, in Telemark, for instance, where Tarjei Vesaas came from, just to mention one place. It’s of course a minority language, it’s written by some 10% only in Norway. Because of that, you get very connected to this language, because it’s a minority language, of course, and you try to defend it the best way you can. I remember as a student, I said in an interview, If someone is attacking my language, the only thing you can do is to knock or go. You cannot argue for it, it’s like arguing for your own existence in a way. Fight or leave.";902;Literature and Language
Do you think your prize motivation made sense?;Yes, completely. If it’s sayable, in a simple way, you just say it in a simple way, why write a poem or a novel? There’s something that cannot be said directly, and you have to turn to literature in a way to manage to say it. I think Jacques Derrida was quite right when he said that, What you cannot say, you should write. Or something close to that. I experienced that as a simple truth. You can write, manage to write very, very complex emotions or a way of experiencing life that’s impossible to speak. I guess that’s somehow the gift of a real author to be able to write in such a way. If you only report what’s out there or what you have experienced or something, everyone can do that in a way, if you only can write a sentence in this or that way. It’s also because of this dimension, I think that literature is really needed, and art in general, it’s saying something that cannot be said in any other way, and that’s why you do it.;902;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Why are silences and pauses important in your writing?;"The best way perhaps to try to describe it, is to go to my plays. I’ve written a lot of plays and quite many novels also, and poems. I guess I published seven collections of poetry or something like that. But let’s go to one of my plays. When I wrote my first play, Somebody Is Going to Come, or Someone Will Come – there are different translations – what I experienced was when you wrote these lines you could just break off and write “pause” or in the middle of a dialogue you could use the word “pause” or if it was very short, I used also “short pause”. If it was a long silence in a way, I wrote “long pause” and to get the right rhythm, it’s all about rhythm, writing to me, basically. To get a rhythm right, you need these pauses, of course. With a change in the tempo, for instance, or when an emotion isn’t outspoken you will not say it directly, but you break off and there’s a pause, but everyone knows exactly what you’re trying, or going to say. I remember Harold Pinter was asked about his bosses, they always talk about lack of communication, and he said that, No, there’s not lack of communications in my plays, there’s too much communication.
To a large degree, I agree with Pinter, it isn’t needed to say, it’s already understood, quite often. But there are several subtle reasons for using a pause in a play, and in the end, if you sum it all up, what you hear is in a way silence. Yes, I would say. In my novels I guess I somehow tried to get to this kind of silence, by all the repetitions. They came from music, but the way they work in my novels, it’s quite similar, I think, to the pauses in my plays. But in the end, this silence I’m talking about, I always feel that there are two languages. It’s the language in which I write, and then there’s a silent language behind it. What it’s really all about is said by this silent language, in a way that it’s very hard to. You cannot say it in a few words, exactly what it’s saying, but you can still hear it, I would say. It’s just like a great painting. All the paintings I like of the same Mark Rothko. His paintings are talking to me a lot, a lot, a lot. They’re not, they’re completely mute. They say a lot. I have kept three dogs and they are just the same, they cannot say a word, but you have the feeling, and they know, they understand, it’s true, an extremely lot. They can sense a mood before it’s there.
One of my collections of poetry is called Dog and Angel, and I think art has to say, to speak in a similar way as a mute dog or as a mute picture, also writing, I would say. I think the words are so rough and they say so little in themself. Let’s say, “kjærlighet” as you say in Norwegian, “kärlek” in Swedish, that’s saying at least something, “love” in English is saying almost nothing. To describe, let’s say, love, you have to use quite other words, of course, to manage to say anything of any value about it. Love is working well in many practical situations, but not when it comes to the real thing. I think every writer is a kind of skeptic, you’re skeptical of the language. You know that a simple word put in a quite normal syntax, they’re saying in fact, rather not much really but it’s needed for the daily life and daily communication and so on. But when it comes to a deeper understanding of life, if you use it in the normal way, you don’t manage to say anything of any interest more than you can say, just by talking.";902;competencies

Could you tell us about your childhood and where your passion for reading and writing came from?;I learned to have pleasure in reading simply because I love stories. At first when you’re a child of course the stories are told to you and, in the way that we grew up, children are entirely the responsibility of the women. We lived in a kind of extended family set up. So when I say the women I mean more than one – various aunts and whatever. It was really very nice sometimes to just sit nearby while they’re telling each other these stories or indeed sometimes including us. So it started like that. Then when you learn to read there are books – not very many at the time – I remember the Aesop’s tales for example, in translation of course in Swahili, being one of the earliest books that I was able to read at school. But that’s not the same thing as the reading that comes later, that is more or less sort of reading and rereading the same thing. Children it seems – I know this from my own children – can read the same book 20 times without tiring of it. So I think familiarity is also part of that pleasure of reading, but then later on curiosity takes over and reading becomes a very fulfilling exercise because you learn as well as enjoy.;904;Motivation
Was Aesop’s tales your favourite book as a child?;I don’t think Aesop’s tales was my favourite. It was I think my earliest, but I do remember the pictures because there were, of course for a child’s book, lots of illustrations. I do remember in that the picture of the fox leaping for the grapes – that has stayed in my mind forever.;904;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
Do you think books that you read when you are young can have a big impression on you?;Yes. And also just simply some of the stories that you hear. You may not remember always the experience of reading, but some of the stories remain for a long time and even for a writer they become sources of places to go to and find out some more and you actually find when you reread a story – like Camaralzaman and Princess Badoura, which is one of those that I do remember and love – you find that in fact, when you go to an adult version of that story, it’s much, much more complicated than you had understood as a child. So there are layers in those stories that you read as a child, which then become possible sources of adventure, reading adventure I mean later on.;904;Creativity
What did you want to be when you were younger? Did you want to be a writer or did you want to be something completely different?;Writing was not really a career that was possible when I was growing up. I didn’t know anybody whose career was a writer, who was a professional writer. So it wasn’t something I aspired to do. I might just as well have aspired to be an astronaut or something like that. It just wasn’t something you knew anybody to be doing. Sometimes you hear children saying, I want to be a train driver or I want to be a computer programmer – but I don’t think I had anything quite like that. I think I was still for a long time open to what might lie ahead. I just enjoyed school and enjoyed learning and enjoyed all of those things. And I just kind of assumed that I’d be doing this for quite a while. Maybe that’s what I wanted to be, just a student.;904;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
How did your upbringing shape you and the writer that you have become?;I didn’t know what or how my upbringing shaped me while I was going through it. I don’t suppose many people do unless they’re extremely unhappy at the time or something like that. I also don’t think I would have reflected on it quite so intensely if it hadn’t been for the fact that I was so far away from the place where I grew up. But I think one of the things I had to do in the process of coming to understand, or to coming to terms with being a stranger here in Britain was to think back to things like my upbringing, where I lived, the things we believed. So this is what I mean when I say I’m not sure if I would’ve thought quite so intensely about it. I think being away actually forces you to examine things, in greater detail, perhaps even more critically not just of the events and so on around you, but also of your own participation in that process of living. So I would say it shaped me very much, not in a bad way, not in a way that is destructive, but in a way that forced reflection.;904;Motivation
Do you find writing to be a good avenue to explore different issues and to be able to reflect on events that have happened in your life? Or do you just see it as something that is purely pleasurable?;"I don’t see writing as purely fun. I do think that there is something necessary about it. This is what I talked about in my Nobel Prize lecture. There are certain imperatives that came up as I began to think about things. And that’s how I started to write. But continuing to write is because you are faced every day with things that are also necessary to be talked about, to be inquired into. And I think for me, this is the drive. It’s to speak about what I see and to do so in a way that both helps me to understand better what it is that I see and also to disseminate, to tell others about it, if they happen to be interested.
I think writing is an important way of extending and understanding our vision to others which is not to say that this is something particularly perceptive or particularly informative. It could be just what we already know. Sometimes we read things and we share in the reflections of others, of the person who’s writing, and perhaps there is some illumination in it that helps us understand, but sometimes it’s just that it endorses things that we have ourselves understood, but not perhaps trusted. So there are various, very complex things happening both in the process of writing but also in the process of the reader engaging with the writing – and I speak as both a reader of course, as well as a writer. That is the pleasure and the fun of the writing process. That you’re not just writing, talking to yourself, but you’re talking to imaginary readers, although for me the imaginary reader is not very specific. You’re not just confiding something to your journal. I know that I will be speaking to people about this and therefore I speak about events in the world. It may be in the form of a story, but a story can be a vehicle for addressing issues as well as addressing injustices as well as indeed just addressing pain and love.";904;meaning of work
How important is diversity in literature?;I suppose, in order to understand how other people live and what it is that motivates and energises and makes them happy and unhappy you have to know about other people. It’s really quite as simple as that. You have to know. And the best way to know about other people is to hear what they have to say and not to be ventriliquising other people’s lives and trying to explain people away. So in this respect writing from other places, or at least from other perspectives, which might be cultural, social, gender, is one of the most direct ways in which you can hear what other people are saying.;904;Diversity-Women in Science
Do you think literature is an important way of hearing other people’s voices and getting access to other people’s world and cultures?;Literature performs different functions of course. Literature also engages us because we take pleasure in it, a kind of complicated pleasure. It depends what you read, of course. But I think at its best literature does that as well as it brings news, tells you things or maybe challenges simplifications that you’ve lived happily with, makes things more difficult for you in that respect. So I see all of those complicated functions. To learn, to enjoy and perhaps also to be challenged, although, that depends on the degree to which you are open to challenges. People can be very difficult in resisting challenges.;904;Role of literature
Where do you get your ideas from when you write?;"The ideas about what to write about just present themselves to you. You don’t have to ache about it, but it seems to me, there are only a limited number of things that really engage a certain kind of writer, that is the writer who maybe writes more reflectively. I think there are things that probably keep returning. Things that are perhaps to do with particular experience, or anxieties that you still want to understand or keep talking about.
I find that when I’ve finished one novel I often think “but I didn’t talk about such and such.” Although it may not be possible to immediately do that, it becomes something at the back of the mind that when there is time, when I can, I will return to this because there’s this aspect that I haven’t done. And maybe I might, and maybe I might not, but it’s in this way that the ideas kind of turn around and percolate, and kind of hang around for a while. And then, it may be something you see, something you read that provides a happy impulse.
So when an idea begins to emerge like this, then you follow it up by reading some more about it, thinking some more about it, making some notes. So it isn’t just an idea comes and you think, oh I think that I will write about this, but it really takes a little bit of a while for it to rumble along before it becomes specific or concrete enough.";904;Research
For any aspiring writers, is there a particular piece of advice that you would give to them?;The best advice you can give a writer is just write. There is no simple way. There is no way in which you can say, if you stand on your head twice a day, that this will enable you to write. You just have to write and keep writing and don’t be discouraged and just keep writing. Now it could be you’re in the wrong business in which case sooner or later you’ll discover that. But you won’t discover that by querying yourself, you’ll only discover that by the full process of doing the writing. And then if that doesn’t work – you can’t persuade anybody at all to be interested in it – then could be that you’re in the wrong business. But even then I wouldn’t give up. I would still keep pressing on.;904;Advice for young writers
What’s your favourite thing about writing?;Oh, I don’t know – when it’s finished! Writing is best when it’s complete, when it’s finished . The process itself has its pleasures. Of course now and then at the end of the day’s work, when you can get up and say, that’s all right, I did okay today, but there also many days when you get up and you think, what a load of rubbish! I’m going to have to go through all that again tomorrow. But I think the best moment in writing is when you think, yep, I think it’s done.;904;meaning of work
What type of books do you like reading and who is your favourite author?;I have favorite authors rather than an author that I can name and these vary a little bit. If I look back 10 years ago, I don’t know who I would’ve said the writers were. Maybe one or two are still with me, but you move on. Recently the things that I’ve enjoyed reading are writers from Africa, like Maaza Mengiste, Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor. These are people who are doing brilliantly well I think, and in both of those cases, they’ve just published their second novels. So very early in their writing careers. But also I admire writers like J.M. Coetzee, Nuruddin Farah, Michael Ondaatje, I can name several. So it isn’t a matter of favourite. I’m open to all these brilliant writers and I read as many of them as time and chance allows – chance in the sense of you don’t always hear about writers or you hear about them but you don’t have time to read all of them, but there are many favourites.;904;Creativity
And what do you enjoy doing outside of writing?;Watching cricket, I enjoy watching cricket. I enjoy gardening. I enjoy cooking. I enjoy reading, listening to music. You see just an ordinary kind of thing that everybody does.;904;Free time
How has life changed for you after being awarded this prize?;Well, the award of the prize was a great honour. I’m very proud of that honour. Because it is such a global event it means that a lot of people want to know about me, want to know me, want to speak to me. Also as a result of the prize many publishers in many different languages who hadn’t published any of my work before are now doing so. So they want their journalists to tell their readers about me. So I’ve been talking to a lot of people since the award of the prize and that really has taken up quite a lot of my time since then. So what has changed since the award of the prize? It’s difficult to assess exactly because I’m just talking all the time to people explaining things. What I do know is that it hasn’t really possible to do any writing during this time, but that’s fine because I know it’ll be like this for a while, but then at some point it’ll be possible to return and write again.;904;Impact of the Nobel on you
We see that the Nobel Prize often inspires people. Who or what inspires you to write?;"What inspires me to write, is to be able to speak truthfully about what I see and the things that concern me. So it’s not just my eyes are open and therefore, whatever strikes my eye I want to write about it, but there are these concerns about… for example I’m very interested in the way people can retrieve something from trauma, so I’m thinking not only of asylum seekers or refugees, but also of life, of the way people in life are able to get something out of mischance, out of traumatic events.
I’ve always been interested in the way families work, particularly the way both power and kindness go along together. Of course, most families love each other, but at the same time there are, what seem like power struggles going on within families. I’m interested in writing about that and the complexity of that and how out of kindness a kind of a sort of unkindness comes as well – requiring obedience that you don’t shame us by doing this, or by doing that. Particularly, I’m thinking of the way women are treated, in our culture anyway, and in many other cultures. Those are the kinds of things that make me want to write. Things that, as I say, my sense of this needs to be spoken about. I need to say something about this. And of course also the other thing that makes me want to write is to create something which is beautiful and pleasurable.";904;Mentors (Role models)

A reading from ‘Die Wiederholung’ (’Repetition’) by Peter Handke;;906;Creativity
Your parents were both teachers. How did that influence you?;It was really a very good beginning for a writer. The books were very present in our house. I saw from the beginning how my parents are discussing books, reading books, buying books and I could spend a lot of time with my father in the library which I remember very good. What I remember very good, and like here we have a shelf and the most interesting books for me were always close to the ground. So, I explored those shelfs very intensively and I think that was the way I really discovered books as a world, as an alternative world. Of course, I think in the beginning, were fairy tales many of them and I do still like fairy tales very much. Even recently I bought a new volume of Brothers Grimm’s fairy tales and they still, I read them as a kind of poetry, but later I think that Jules Verne affected me very much. So, I started to think in this way – crossing borders, thinking about other countries and other cultures, travelling – so that was the very strong idea for me.;907;Mentors (Role models)
Did you enjoy school?;I liked my school but rather from social reasons because of my friends and the time spending together. But I was a type of child who rather preferred self-education, so I had many hobbies, many fascinating subjects like astronomy for instance. So, I really spent a lot of time studying for my pleasure. I remember very well my teacher from secondary school. She was biologist and she taught us biology and she opened my eyes for this beautiful aspect of physical existence of every living being.;907;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
What did you want to be when you were younger?;Of course, as a very young child, I would be an actress like every single girl I think, but later I excepted that the progress of science will be quicker, I think and then I expected that it will be possible to be a physician, but a cosmic physician, so I was thinking about my future profession as taking part in cosmic, oh god, how to say, expedition. So, I remember myself dreaming about to be a part of a cosmic expedition and work in science checking how the human body is relating with cosmic space, it was a very fantastic idea. Of course, I think that I overestimated the time of development of science. Now I can realise that this is the same subject in my books – thank you for this question.;907;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
How has your training as a psychologist affected the way you tell stories?;I think that it was a good choice to study psychology. Of course, I was temptated by my mother to study literature even if she knew from the beginning that I wanted to write, but psychology taught me very many important things. I think the one, the most important one that there is every single human being is the source of a novel, it’s a source of many stories. So, we are living in a world that like, more or less, five billion of stories, novels, in potential state existing still around us. But the second reason, why studying psychology was a very good choice, is that this training as a psychotherapist taught me how to listen to people. It’s a kind of ability you can really train and then you can be open much more for what people are saying to you.;907;Environment
Which experience has most influenced your work?;The most influencial experience which really is strong related to my work is, I think, this moment I decided to move to the countryside and then … because I grew up as a child in the countryside, then after big cities and this kind of chaotic life, I came back to the nature. And then I discovered a kind of different state of mind which was very good for my writing and gave me a kind of concentration, silence, inner silence.;907;Mentors (Role models)
What do you enjoy most about the process of writing?;I think that most funny and mysterious thing is creating characters. It looks, in the beginning, that I’m really inventing because I need a character, a personality to the story, to my story. But in fact, it looks rather like those characters are coming from outside to my story, so, they are already existing somewhere and there are the first step is that they look rather shapely, only cloudy, not in a physical way, but there is another step of this process when I can hear what they are talking between each other or when they are talking to me. So, this is the best moment in my writing. It must be special, very deep and special connection, relationship between me as a narrator, me as an author and my characters and for sure they are taking from me many things, but I’m also, I’ve learned from them. Sometimes they surprise me because of somethings I didn’t know about them, so, it’s really very mysterious. I’m going to write about it. And of course, there are many dimensions of writing because first of all you need to make a research or even to invent an entire story, to support yourself by another books, other ideas, to talk with people, to make some notes. And then there is a beginning of writing and sculpturing the entire story. So, it’s so many dimensions that it’s never boring really, and they like it. This is my only one profession, I cannot do anything else, so.;907;Motivation
Do you think there are specific qualities that you need to be a good writer?;There is one, I presume, which is ability to live in a kind of regime, so, kind of regularity in writing and also, how to say, to manage, kind of management of our time we have to dispose.;907;Advice for young writers
Which book of yours would you recommend a new reader to start with?;There is no such a book I think, because, first of all, I should ask, who is the reader? If is, if it is young or middle-age, woman or man, I don’t know, introvert or extrovert, it’s quite complicated. But there are some books I like, there are some books of mine I like more than the other and I think there is still one book which wasn’t translated into Swedish, it’s called ‘Anna in the graves of the world’ [Anna w grobowcach świata], it’s like a cyber punk, a little bit, old story based on the Sumerian mythology. So, this book could be nice for teenagers for instance.;907;Creativity
Who has most influenced you as a writer?;It is also hard to answer, because it depends from in which moment of my life. There were many such a fascination of mine on a special kind of writing, special novels. So, it’s quite fluent I would say, but for sure I do belong to this Central European tradition of writing, telling story and also writing, and discovering the language, I would say. And among those writers from Central Europe, I would underline the name of Bruno Schulz, who was very important for me as a Polish writer, writing in Polish, because he did incredible things with Polish language. But I also like this kind of parabolic writing, also rooted in Central Europe, like Franz Kafka for instance. But of course, when I was young, much younger, as a teenager, I was fascinated by literature of Southern America. I like Russian writers very much, this kind of realism and irony. So, it could be a very long answer, till the evening.;907;Mentors (Role models)
How can we make women’s voices more heard in literature – and beyond?;I think that the process already began but we are still somewhere on the beginning of this process. Once I wrote a book about three women, the mother, grandmother and the daughter, and I tried to describe their experiences as really existential, so the human being face to death and all those very demanding experiences in our life. And by the Polish critics this book was described as a saga, saga, is that good expression? I was so disappointed because when they realised that the main characters are women and the author is woman, it must be a saga. Sometimes I think that we need, not only female writing, but also creating the female characters in literature as a philosophical, ethical subject, facing towards the most important challenges, contemporary challenges then, because when we are thinking about a man, I mean a human being, we still have somewhere in the back of our minds, a man, the figure of man. So, this one is very important, this should be, to be changed.;907;Role of literature
You unmask borders and nationalism in your work. Can you tell us about this theme?;The first, the very, the simplest answer should be connected with place of my growing up and also in the places where I used to live and it’s always kind of karma because I was born close to the German border and then I now living close to Czech border. My family was part of this big political changing of borders after the Second war, so they were refugees from one part of Poland territory to the other, gained after the second war. So, the story about borders were very present in my childhood and also in my own life. But also, this subject is fascinating because of, from this abstract site. Borders are a challenge for us but also feel very deeply the deep need to crossing the borders. It is something … I remember myself living in this small village, there was a, there is a still, an old border in the forest and I used to take my dogs and went to the forest just for crossing the border, for clear plain pleasure, for the joy that I’m a free person and the border in fact doesn’t exist in a real sense. And of course, especially in Jakob’s book, I would like to relate to the previous concept of Poland as a multi-culture country, as a society speaking many languages, which we completely lost after the Second war, so, this is also something deep need to rebuild the old image of Poland.;907;Life
Would you say that travel and movement is a key theme in your work?;Yes, it is. I do believe that we, all of us, we have somewhere in our, perhaps genes, our psyche, we have this nomadic instinct which creates our lives. And even if we are living entire life in one place, we’re still thinking about just crossing those places where we are designed to be. And this deep need is very, also very present in my life so, writing Flights I tried to write that kind of monographic of movement on many levels. From this touristic level, site for pilgrimage, for also kind of neurotic, you know, an easiness to go somewhere, to check somewhere, just to also missing places we’ve never been before, which also creates our lives in very, very visible ways. So, I would say this book is just monographic of movements, literary monographic of movements.;907;Creativity
How does the issue of sustainability appear in your work?;I’m not the type of activist. I’m too neurotic and too nervous to make a speech, you know, to a big group of people. I’m not this kind of fighter but what I can do it’s, I can invent some ideas and I can write down those ideas and I can create a story which will move another people like Drive your plow over the bones of the dead, and after this book many people told me that they became vegetarian so it is really something. So, I’m going to do what I really can do, this is my small field of my activity. And of course, literature is a very specific way of understanding the world and very specific and very raffinated, special, sophisticated way of communication. So, I would like, in my writing, I would like to try just a kind of general ideas of instruction, how to deal with those very dangerous things connected with climate changes. So, please understand that I am not an activist. This is what I’m going to say. I’m going to write about it in my own language, in using my imagination to make our consciousness broader.;907;Meaning (Values) of Work
Tell us about the foundation you’re creating using the prize money?;That was one of the first thoughts after this announcement and after realising that I, in a completely different situation right now. I was always very active in doing something for the small community. I used to live of making some projects for other people and now I have such a possibility, now I can really do so. We are now writing a stated, or how, what is the English word? The plan of the foundation, goals of the foundation and the main goals will be connected with literature, the small residences for writers and translators of course, but I’m also very keen to focus on ecology, especially in our small community, in our village and there are many, many ideas, also animal rights which is also very important things for me.;907;Impact of the Nobel on you
What’s the one piece of advice you’d give to aspiring writers?;It’s a complicated question. I know that there are many kinds of studying, called creative writing for instance and the people then trying to learn how to write, how to live in writing, because for me, writing is rather a psychological process, not just the process of writing on a paper, even not inventing a story, but something which is very deeply connected with our psychological side. So, I think that there is only one advice, to read, to read. I think read and read, and for every single one written page it is always one thousand pages which should be read.;907;Advice for young writers
What does the Nobel Prize mean to you?;Until October it was something that very great people, and in my imagination I always thought older people, won. It was not anything I would win. I am going to say this when I deliver my banquet speech later. But I first heard about the Nobel Prize when I was a small child in Japan and I remember still my mother explaining it to me, I am looking at, and it must have been some sort of educational book telling the readers about the history of the Nobel Prize. So for me it has been embedded in my imagination all through my life. It is probably the greatest prize that a person can win in the world.;908;Impact of Nobel on you
How do you feel about being a role model?;"I think it is better not be too self-conscious about being a role model. Ever since I became a published writer and became well-known I think you have that sense anyway. That you have to be responsible to some extent but also to try to inspire younger people and your fellow writers. Becoming a Nobel Laureate has made me more conscious of this role. I think this has put me on a different level in terms of being a role model and my responsibility as a public figure so that is something I am going to have to think about and get used to. I am no longer just a writer of interest to people who are interested in writers. I am occupying some other special position as a Nobel Laureate. So it is something I have not quite worked out yet.
But I think I have to be very careful because I notice already in the two months since the announcement I have been asked to do all kinds of things, sign petitions, support all kinds of campaigns, take part in discussion programmes I have no qualification to take part in. Many invitations that have come in that I would not have received before October. I have had this advice from past Nobel Prize winners I have met to be careful. I must not put myself on a platform for which I am not qualified. I think that is a very important piece of advice not just for me, but for the world. We do not want people who are not experts talking as though they are. This is one of the problems in the world today. So that is something I am going to be quite disciplined about. I am only going to talk about things I know about.";908;Mentors (Role models)
What is the importance of the Nobel Prize?;"The importance of any prize, there are many prizes in the world. The importance of any prize, how seriously we take the prize, for me it depends on the integrity of the people who give the prize and also on the history of past winners. I think those are the two important things because prizes themselves are used as a tool all around the world now to promote things. Most often to promote a company or to promote something, but sometimes they are used to promote political ideas and sometimes quite subtly and sometimes less so. There have been prizes that I have turned down because I thought, you know, they were not hideously bad prizes, but I thought I don’t necessarily wish to be helping to promote something.
I think we have to be aware that prizes are a technique, they are sometimes propaganda, they are sometimes promotional tools for organisations, corporations, institutions. So I always ask myself this question about any prize, whether somebody else is getting it or whether I am being offered it. Who is giving it? Do I respect the values that lie behind the prize and the people who are giving it and do I respect the previous winners and I think this is the first thing I said quite spontaneously when I received the call from the Swedish Academy. I said, I feel emotionally truly honoured by the Nobel because I can absolutely honestly say the Nobel is an institution that I deeply respect, and I deeply deeply respect the past winners in literature that have received it since 1901. I mean a lot of my greatest heroes are there on that list.
The Nobel is a prize that has managed to capture the imagination of the world. Not as a promotional tool but as something that exemplifies an ideal about humanity and what we strive for and that is quite a rare thing. I think there are many great prizes, but I think the Nobel sets a very high standard because it is not just about the specialist area that we may or may not excel in. There is a higher idea I think about peace, cooperation between people, the striving of human beings to improve our civilisation and I think these are very very high ideals.";908;Impact of Nobel on you
Memory, guilt and delusion are recurring themes in your work – why?;"I think earlier in my career I was always very interested in looking at individuals who struggled with their past and their memories. So typically I would look at a character in late middle age or old age. Someone who had been quite proud of himself or herself, but then quite late in life gains a perspective about his life. Let us just say his life. And he starts to think Oh actually, I had all my values wrong, I backed the wrong things, I backed the wrong causes. Does that mean my life has been wasted? I lived my life by the wrong values even though for most of my life I thought I was living by the right values. That was a typical situation I became fascinated in. I wrote at least three or four novels around these kinds of ideas.
As I got older as a writer I became interested in that same question but applied to societies and nations. That is something that I am still trying to figure out, how best to express that question? How would a nation or a country struggle with the nation’s dark or shameful memories? When is it better to just leave these things buried and move on. Because we can see all around the world now and, in history, cases where conflict just goes on and on and on. You just cannot stop it, stop the cycle because people will not forget atrocities from the past. Sometimes people, generations, are fighting over something that happened centuries ago and hatred has developed. So sometimes it is not good to remember.
But particularly in Europe I think, and America too, Japan we have problems of memories that have been suppressed and the society is not at peace with itself about say racism or what happened in the Second World War. There is a sense that issues have not been addressed and this leads to all kinds of tension. At the moment America is in a terrible turmoil because there is a feeling that certain things about its past, about African-Americans particularly have not been addressed properly. I think Europe has been in the state of tension ever since the Second World War. So this question about personal memory and national memory I think is something that interests me very much.";908;Creativity
What has influenced your writing style and for whom are you writing?;"I never really think much about genre. Often I am drawn to a particular project which I have chosen quite carefully because I do not have many ideas. I have one good idea every five years or something so it is not as though I have a big choice. I don’t sit there thinking now I’ll write a thriller or now I’ll write a love story or a period thing. I have an idea and it is usually an idea that doesn’t yet have a setting. I don’t really have a time and place geographically or in time where I am going to put this story down. I just think wouldn’t it be interesting to write a story about a person who has this particularly issue and then this happens to them emotionally? It is something quite abstract so I find myself almost like, you know, the way movie people go location hunting when they have got a script, where would be a good place to film this? I find myself looking through history or looking through different genres to try and figure out what is the best way to express this story.
I am never particularly … I never start off by saying I might do something that is a bit like a science fiction book or something like a detective story. I become desperate and I use whatever I can to express the particular idea and it is only when I finish that somebody might look at what I have written from the outside and say, oh that looks like a piece of fantasy or that looks like science fiction. For me I have not looked at it from the outside and I am like a crazy person trying to build a flying machine in my garage or in my back garden and I am just putting anything on that will make this thing fly. You know, I might steal something from next door or borrow things. Anything that could make this thing go up in the air and fly. It is only when it is flying that people look at it and say that looks like a period of a love story or something like this.";908;Motivation
When did you decide to become a writer?;"I never really had a big ambition to be a writer and until I was in my, almost in my mid-twenties. From the time I was around fifteen years old my big ambition was to be a songwriter and I spent a lot of time writing songs in my bedroom with a guitar. I think I was very much inspired by the man who won the Nobel Prize for Literature last year, in 2016, Bob Dylan. I remember buying an album of his when I was thirteen years old. And I still remember the album, ‘John Wesley Harding’. I think that was when I first became very excited about the idea that you could use words in a very mysterious way and create entire worlds just with a few words. Of course the music and the singing and all these things were very important to me, it is that whole combination. But the excitement about words, I think, and the fact that you can use them in this way. I mean that really happened to me when I first listened to my very first Bob Dylan album, when I was thirteen years old.
And then I became interested in all these singer-songwriters who are at what you might call the literary end of the 1970s boom. Leonard Cohen was very important to me, Joni Mitchell. I learnt to play all their song myself. I knew all their lyrics off by heart and I tried, I wrote over a hundred songs myself in my bedroom and I played them with my friends. And in a way I feel that was my apprenticeship for becoming a writer of fiction. Somewhere in my twenties I made, to me a transition that did not seem like a very big one between writing songs and writing short stories. It was only over a period of about a year when I was writing songs at the beginning of this year towards the end of that year that energy had gone into writing short stories.
And after years of getting nowhere, professionally, as a singer-songwriter around the age of twenty-four, when I was twenty-four, twenty-five as soon as I started to write short stories they were being accepted and published by magazines. I was actually spotted by the publishing house that is still my publishing house in London, Faber and Faber. A company that’s published many many Nobel Prize winners actually. And I wrote my first novel under a contract with them. It’s like many things in life, I was knocking on one door for a long time and then another one opened. From then on I mean fiction has been my focus, but somewhere at the back of my mind I am still a singer-songwriter.
I still write, I write song lyrics for the American jazz singer Stacey Kent and in fact an album of hers came out in October, I think, and two of the tracks have my lyrics on. I still work as a song lyricist and for me it is quite an important part of my writing life. It is another kind of outlet and I feel it is quite important for me to have that, this other writing life, where I think in a very different kind of way. I am forced to think in a very different kind of way because I am collaborating, and I think that is always a healthy thing to have collaborators. One of the disadvantages of being a novelist as opposed to being … a lot of these scientists working in big teams and if you work in the theatre or films you work with teams of people. The danger for novelists I think, we work in isolation and so there is a problem. You may not grow and develop in the same way. It is easier to become ossified. I think for me it’s quite important to collaborate with people in other fields, like music or film. I find it very stimulating and I learn many things from what I am obliged to do in collaboration.";908;Motivation
Which writers do you look up to?;"I have spoken about my early influences from the world of music, singer-songwriter music. But if we are talking about actually literary influences, oddly, people never seem to say this when they are looking at my work. But I know that the novelist that has influenced me the most is Charlotte Brontë, the nineteenth-century British novelist, and particularly two books Jane Eyre and Villette.
And I reread Jane Eyre and Villette about five years ago and I was quite embarrassed. It was full of things that I could recognise I had stolen from those books. But I read those books at a particularly crucial point in my writing life, I think. Before I actually started to write fiction, but when I was starting to think about writing fiction. And so particularly the use of first person, the first person technique. What the narrator hides from the reader and hides from herself in the Charlotte Brontë books became the foundation for me. And so Charlotte Brontë remains a big influence.
There are other writers that are great favourite writers of mine and possibly Dostoevsky is my favourite novelist but probably he hasn’t influenced my style very much. He writes in a very, very different way. However I think influence is a very interesting and subtle thing. Sometimes somebody who is very different to me in temperament, actually I think because of that difference it is almost like it is a, it creates a tension, a natural tension. I think that is very good. Something is pulling me away from my comfort zone and I think Oh yes I had to do that. What would Dostoevsky do with this? and of course I could never write like Dostoevsky but I think a little bit of Dostoevsky would help here.
Marcel Proust was very important to me. More technically, how to tell a story not necessarily through the plot or through chronology of how the events unfold in your story but the great freedom I see in Proust’s work of just following the drifting memories or the thought associations of the narrator. So you can have an episode from yesterday and it goes right into a memory from thirty years ago. This much more abstract way of ordering your canvas as a writer. I learnt an enormous amount from Proust. But everybody – Kafka is another writer who is very important to me. Kafka and Samuel Beckett and actually Harold Pinter another … I think Kafka isn’t, but the other two are Nobel Prize winners. People who give me guidance and inspiration about how to deviate from realism, from doing something to distort the familiar reality that we see around us. Once you move away from orthodox realism, the question becomes so what do you do, what are your new laws? In fact this is a Bob Dylan line isn’t it? “To live outside the law you have to be honest.” But I think that is very true when you deviate from realism. The great writers like Kafka, Beckett, Pinter, they are models for me. For how you deviate from conventional realism.";908;Mentors (Role models)
How has your wife supported your work?;"I’ve had many people who have been important editors and advisors in my writing over the years I mean, many of them are professional people, my editors at the publishing house. So my first agent Deborah Rogers who has passed away now, and my first editor Robert McCrum were very important influences. But the person who has a very deep influence on what I write at all kinds of levels is my wife Lorna. And I think part of it is because she is my wife and she tends to boss me around in many aspects of my life and so my work is not excluded. However the key thing here is that, we were together, we were a couple at a time, before I started to write fiction, so somewhere in her mind she doesn’t think that I am this kind of famous author and that she is criticising the work of a famous author. She still thinks I am this postgraduate student who has got this crazy idea that he can write fiction. She still thinks a bit like that.
So she looks at it and says What is this? That has never changed, because she was there looking at the very first things I wrote in a little room we shared together when we were both postgraduate students. I don’t think the relationship has changed very much. And the problem is that once you start to become well-known, well-established … For me I won the Booker Prize in Britain when I was thirty-four years old. The trouble with that is, there are many great things about becoming respected young, but a lot of people stop criticising you. They are afraid to criticise you or professional publishers think you will move to different publishing house if they speak frankly. So I need somebody like my wife who thinks of me as an upstart who has all these ideas above my station about writing and she can be quite brutal. I have sometimes abandoned whole projects because she has taken one glance, usually when she seems perhaps not in a very good mood and says This won’t do. Do something else!";908;Career Devleopment
Do you have any advice for aspiring writers?;"A lot of people ask me Do you have any advice for aspiring writers or young writers? These days, I don’t know how it is in Sweden but certainly in the English-speaking world every university seems to have a creative writing course. There are private creative writing programmes everywhere. Everyone is very keen to be a writer these days. That wasn’t the case when I was young. Nobody was interested in literature. It is very difficult for me to come out with any kind of useful advice about how you write. Everybody must do it in their own way but there is one fundamental thing I would say to young people at the early stages or people who have these ambitions. I would say particularly in the world as it is today, you have to ask yourself Do you really want to write or do you want to be a writer?
Because I think many people have this ambition to be a writer. They want the status, the position of being a writer. But actually they may find that they don’t particularly want to write and I think to be a successful writer and I mean successful not just commercially but to be a writer who achieves something worthwhile regardless of whether it is published or sold. You have to have a special relationship with writing. And I think part of the difficulty at the moment is that it is quite difficult for people to find out themselves which it is they really want. Because being a writer has become such a coveted position now and a lot of people dream of being a writer but sometimes perhaps that is not the right thing because you know writing is not for you and that is alright. Something else may be for you. So I would say, get that very clear. Try and find out, do you really want to write? That is the important thing!";908;Advice for young writers
What made you become a writer?;I think I became a writer because I didn’t know of anything else to do. Maybe some incident from my childhood influenced me. I remember reading James Fenimore Cooper’s The Last of the Mohicans when I was only six years old, and I didn’t understand much of it, but I still finished it. Possibly that reading obsession influenced me so much that later in life I became a writer. When I was older, after I had studied a while, I even tried to enrol to study medicine but failed a science exam. I started writing as it was the only thing I knew. And it just continued, I was launched and … it was like a snowball effect.;911;Motivation
How do you work? How does an novel originate?;I quickly realised that it is difficult to get started when writing a novel. You have this dream of what you want to create, but it is like walking around a swimming pool and hesitating to jump in, because the water is too cold. Once you get started you have to write every day, otherwise you lose the momentum. When I was younger I just put off the writing until later in the day, but now I write early every morning, to get it done. I can only write for a few hours at a time, after that my attention fades.;911;Motivation
Do you know the end of your novel when you start writing?;"To know the end is always difficult. That is why I have always envied some crime writers who can foresee the end. Not knowing the end is hard, because you are obliged to continue without knowing where you are heading, though towards the end you do get a feeling for in which direction you’re going. Knowing when and where to end is always a delicate matter; you have to find the exact moment in which to cut, to stop yourself.";911;Motivation
Who or what is your source of inspiration?;I have to see an exact, real life, place in front of me. A realistic place, a street, a building where it is all happening and from which I can then continue dreaming. One of my books starts in the tube with a girl believing she sees her mother whom she hasn’t seen for a long time, and then follows her.;911;Mentors (Role models)
Do you have any advice for aspiring writers?;At my time I improvised, so it is difficult to give specific advice. Best advices are the mundane ones, not too precise ones, rather indications. Encourage aspiring writers to continue writing when things are going against them, when it feels hard. Explain the typical obstacles that occur and encourage and reassure them to continue, never to give up.;911;Advice for young writers
What were you doing when you heard you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;It is a bit strange, but I was walking in rue d’Assas very close to the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris when my daughter called me and told me the news. Rue d’Assas happens to be the street where August Strindberg* lived when he was in Paris. So, I don’t know, but it is a curious coincidence with this Swedish connection.;911;Impact of Nobel on you
Mr Mo Yan, I’d like to congratulate you to the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature. First of all, I’d like to ask you… You were born in a village in Shandong to illiterate parents, so how did you start writing?;"Yes, I was born in a village in Shandong, but my father was literate. He studied in a private village school and was a cultured village intellectual. He always encouraged us to study.
My eldest brother went to Shanghai’s East China Normal University in the 1960s. This wasn’t very common in my village. He left many books at home and I read those language and history textbooks when I was young. Gradually, through reading novels, I developed my interest in literature.";913;Impact of the Nobel on you
So how did you start writing? Did you decide to do it by yourself?;"I think all writers start as keen readers. We develop a desire to write while reading. We like to learn how to write. Besides, for village teenagers like myself at that time, writers were stars.Anyone who writes a novel is truly exceptional.
Moreover, there were some intellectuals in my village at the time. They were university graduates who had come from Jinan, Shandong’s capital. They taught me about literature and writers. So the interest for writing grew in me already at a young age. In primary school, I was good at writing and often complimented by my teachers. These are the reasons why I gradually got into writing.";913;Motivation
Can you tell us more about your childhood? What was it like?;"All writers start by writing about their childhood, especially childhood memories. I was born in 1955. When I started forming memories, it was the most difficult time in China’s history. Most people were starving at the time. People led a tough life. People starved to death all the time, even in my village. I think that children’s memories from such times can be haunting.
I remember that there were many children in the village.When the sun came out in winter, we all sat by a wall and bathed in the sun. Our clothes were all torn and ripped. We were barely covered. We also had bloated stomachs, because of lack of nutrients. Our legs and arms were thin, like those typical for starved children.
I was quite naughty when I was in primary school and I was expelled in fifth grade. But I couldn’t join the adult workforce after the expulsion because I didn’t have much work ability. So I herded cattle and sheep alone. In such a solitary environment one has only the animals and the plants to talk to. I think the kind of childhood I had was quite unique.
When I later started writing, everything in my childhood came back to me, so I used these memories, mixed with ideas and events from real life, when I created my earliest novels.";913;Life
Why were you expelled in fifth grade?;"It was during the Cultural Revolution. There were political activities and class struggle, and people were insecure. My family owned land before the liberation, so my background wasn’t great. Children like us could go to school in theory but if one did go, and didn’t do well. By “do well” I mean being liked by the teachers. If they didn’t like you, you’d be deprived and denied the right to continue in school.
Another reason is that the school didn’t teach much at the time. We read “The Quotations from Chairman Mao” in language class and in mathematics or other classes, students were rebelling. Students fought and quarreled every day.
My parents felt that I couldn’t learn anything there. So when I was thrown out, they didn’t fight for me and I didn’t care much about that kind of school anyway. So I left school very early. I was only 11.";913;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
How did you feel like at the time?;"I felt quite lonely. Children like to hang out in groups and those in my age were all in school. They may not have learned much, but they fought and quarreled and had fun. When I was herding cattle and sheep, I passed the front door of my school and saw children in my age having fun in school. I was the only outsider. So I felt very lonely at the time.
Also, I didn’t know what to do with my future. Here I was, herding cattle at a young age. Would I ever do anything else? What would my future hold? What would I do when I grew up? I felt hopeless.
The experiences I had in my childhood have been crucial to my writing. I wrote about all kinds of animals and plants in my novels. I wrote about the close and mysterious relationship between children and nature. This is all inseparable of my personal experiences.
If I look back at my past… First of all, I couldn’t go to school when I was young, and I regret that. But at the same time, I feel kind of glad about it. If I hadn’t gone through that painful experience as a child I would probably not have become a writer. If I had, I would definitely have become a different kind of writer. I would definitely be writing a different kind of books.
That’s why, in a sense, dropping out at a young age returning to the farm, being embraced by nature and the rural culture helped me a great deal in becoming a writer. Of course, I wouldn’t take my children out of school to make them writers by taking them back to the farm. It doesn’t work that way.
As I said before, the painful experiences in my childhood helped me in my writing, but if I had the chance to choose how I lived my childhood, I would definitely go for a happy one, instead of a lonely and hungry childhood.";913;Personal Characteristics
In what ways did it help your writing?;"Firstly, I was able to establish an intimate relationship with nature. A child growing up in school, and a child growing up in the field have different relationships to nature, different feelings for animals and plants. The other were surrounded by other kids and teachers every day. But I was surrounded by sheep, cattle, plants, grass and trees every day. The feelings I had towards nature were so delicate and sentimental. For a long time, I thought animals and plants could communicate with humans. And I felt that they understood what I said. This kind of experience is unique and valuable.
Also, I didn’t hang out with a group of children. I was with a group of adults. I didn’t have the right to speak. They were my uncles, and they were adults. They would be scornful if I interrupted their conversation. But I could listen. I started observing the adult world earlier than most children. I started listening to adults earlier than most.
From my grandparents I learned about the rural culture. In rural culture there are historical figures, legends, historical events and even myths and ghost stories such as a wolf or a rooster turning into a human. So folk elements and oral tradition figure strongly in my books, as they are part of my experiences at that time.
It’s a unique point of view, to observe the world through the eyes of a child. When an adult looks at things, he’s not surprised by what he sees. But when a child looks up from below, because it is an upward view it sees a lot of things that adults don’t see. It helps me a lot in my writing as well.
Of course there are also other aspects, that I can’t explain all at once.";913;Motivation
In your childhood, you had an intimate relationship with nature. When you look at China of today, how do you feel about it?;"I’m a conservationist. I have expressed my conservationism clearly in my books. In “Life and Death are Wearing Me Out” and “Big Breasts and Wide Hips” I expressed my agony and anger over overexploitation and the destruction of the environment.
I’ve always believed that we should slow down our pace of development. We shouldn’t exploit things so quickly. We should preserve rural culture and natural heritage. Stop turning all the villages into towns. We should let the land rest. We shouldn’t work the land as hard as if it was a human.
I’m very distressed by the pollution and the destruction of China’s environment since the 1980s. I feel really bad about it. When I see that factories are built everywhere even in a village I was familiar with… When I see that the river I swam and fished in as a boy has become a dirty ditch, I can’t begin to describe the pain. When I see the trees in my village hung with old plastic bags… This kind of plastic pollution scares me. That’s why, when I give speeches in Japan and other countries, I criticise this kind of overexploitation, which only centres on economic gain based on unsustainable development.";913;Creativity
Let’s return to the subject of literature. Do you think that literature is of any meaning to the general public today?;"The relationship between literature and reality; its emotional connection to people; is a subject many have theorised on. My perspective on literature is: First of all, don’t overestimate it. Don’t expect a novel, a poem or a play to change the realities of our society. That’s a too high expectation. Of course, it has happened that a piece of literature has led to war. But such incidents are very unique. Most often, the impact of literature is very delicate.
That’s because literature is a form of art. Through the appreciation of the aesthetic, the impact is gradual and descreet, like spring showers moistening the soil. So I think, to put literature on such a high pedestal, expecting it to alter reality to do that to literature, is to give it too much weight or responsibility.
Yet one shouldn’t belittle it, either. Literature is not just for fun; its purpose is not simply to draw a few laughs. I think literature’s most precious quality lies is its study of the human soul.  Literature praises what’s true and kind. Literature exposes and criticises what is dark and ugly. Its ultimate goal is to let our mind become richer and more expansive and make us kinder and more gracious. Via its transformation of people literature affects our society’s development and improvement. But I think it is a very gradual process.
I have an analogy to the relationship between literature and society, and that is the relationship people have with their hair: It is, of course, good to have a full head of hair. It looks nice and helps protect one’s head. But if one doesn’t have much hair, like me, that’s fine, as I’m still healthy. So it is with literature. A society may have many novels, poems, poets and writers which is very good. But if there are less of them, life is still…survivable. So I think, whether it is literature or art, it’s like human hair.
In the end, when a person dies, he gets buried in the ground. If he is dug up after many years, we find that his flesh has become earth but his hair remains. I mean, many things in society changes and disappear perhaps only literature and art will remain.";913;Role of literature
That is a very interesting analogy. When you started writing, what was your reason? What were you thinking about?;"I used to half-jokingly, half-seriously say that my initial reason for writing was that I wanted to live a happy life of eating dumplings three times a day. I said it so often that I grew tired of it. But in truth, my answer is still the same. My initial reason for writing wasn’t all that noble.
Some writers say, “I want my writing to change society.” “I want to shape beautiful minds through literature.” They give literature all these definitions. There are many writers like that. I think that for Chinese writers like me, who were born in farming villages and have lived a lower class life in poverty, our initial reason to write was probably very simple – lowly, even. It was to put food on the table, to change our situation and improve our position. Taking up a pen actually has many material benefits.
Of course, through the process of writing, when your life changes as a result many other ideas about literature naturally ensue. So, the initial reason was really not noble at all – even kind of vulgar. But that was actually the first idea I had.
I mentioned earlier that there were some educated people in my village. Some of them were educated people who had made a mistake in the 1960s. Today, when we say “made a mistake”, we should put quotation marks around it. They came to our village as punishment.
One of them used to tell me, that he had known a writer who lived lavishly and would eat dumplings three times a day. Families like mine would only have dumplings during the Spring Festival, so only once or twice a year. But here was someone who had dumplings three times a day! We were in disbelief. We thought not even a king could live such a life. But as a writer, he could. So I asked him, “If I could write books, would I be able to live such a life, too?” “But of course”, he said. So that was my first reason for writing.";913;Motivation
This reason for you… What is your reason for writing today?;"Today, I can surely eat dumplings three times a day. Even in the middle of the night: I just take some out of the fridge and cook them. So today, my goals from those first days have long been achieved. So what drives me? What’s motivates me to keep writing? I can’t explain it in just a few sentences.
First of all, I just feel that I have something to say. I want to write down my thoughts and relate them to my readers through a polished piece of work.
Secondly, there are many things in society that I feel a duty to write about.
Another reason is my explorations to innovate literature as an art, which also drives me to write. Since the fictional form first emerged, at least a thousand years have passed. Within the art of literature and fiction there have always emerged new forms. Writers kept making changes to the form of fiction, whether in language or format. So, is there room for creativity for our generation of writers? I think there is. I see fiction as an art, and its development as infinite. Its format also has infinite possibilities. This near obsessive pursuit of fiction as an art, encourages me to keep writing.";913;Motivation
Why do you use a pen name, and why Mo Yan?;"I talked about this at the press conference this afternoon. My name is Guan Moye. The second part becomes Mo Yan if broken up. In traditional writing, the left side of the ideogram is “Yan” and the right is “Mo”. Also, the second part, “Moye”, sounds like “Mo Yan”.
Another reason is that I was a very talkative child. Back in those days, if one talked too much one could get oneself and one’s family into trouble. It wasn’t always political, as when one said something counter-revolutionary but could also be social relationships. One could say something that offended a neighbour and upset one’s parents as the neighbour would get angry with them. When I was a child, I was too talkative which caused my parents much trouble. They would often criticise me, educate me, or even scold me. They would scold me for running my mouth.
Also, when I decided to start writing I had a somewhat superstitious idea as many great writers had pen names. People like Lu Xun and Ba Jin all used pen names. Many foreign writers as well. So, I thought, in order to write novels, one should first have a pen name. So when thinking about it, I came up with “Mo Yan”.
It is a way of paying respect to my parents’ teachings. Also, it is a kind of reminder and encouragement to myself. I think, if one wants to be a writer, one must speak less and write more. Talking exhausts energy and is time-consuming. If one puts the time and energy spent on talking into writing one can write more. So part of the pen name’s meaning is to encourage myself to work hard.";913;Personal Characteristics
If you look back on your work, do you see any recurring theme or recurring perspective?;"There are two recurring themes. One is hunger, the other is loneliness. I have mentioned this many times. In my novels, especially the earlier ones these are two very important themes as these two things have affected me the most and deepest. Whenever I write about the past, these two themes will inevitably come up.
I think there is one more, something I have been pursuing until this day: my interest in the exploration of the depths of the human soul. Why are people the way they are? Why are some good and some bad? When facing the same things, why do people react so differently? Why are some naturally kind, while others, born into comfortable lives and given good education, grow up to be so evil? These are things I find unfathomable. I want to search for an answer through my writings and study this profound issue, to which there is no simple answer.";913;Creativity
This sounds like psychology to me. Have you found an answer?;"I have not found an answer. Sometimes I am prone to superstition. Sometimes I think… We often believe that education and socialisation can remove hereditary traits. When we speak of someone being good or bad, we often link it to socialisation. But after my long-term observation and first-hand experiences I think it’s not always decided by socialisation. Some people are just born that way. Their thought processes are different. They are born to promote self-interest at others’ expense. Some are born to endure hardship and perform good deeds for others.
I think this is God’s will. God wanted to make the human world more complex so he created a group of true saints people with higher-than-average morality, such as Confucius. Such people are selfless and prioritise other people’s interests. For other people’s sake, they will give up what they treasure most. This is not a result of education.
The majority, average people like us two have the basic capacity for kindness. But there is also a grey area, deep within us, that sometimes puts our self-interest first. Sometimes we also have vulgar emotions. Most people are like that.
Another group is the opposite of saints. They are born evil. They have no sense of morality. People like us, because we have a basic notion of morality, if we do something that hurts others we feel bad, we criticise ourselves, and we even repent. People who are born evil have no basic notion of morality, and no conscience. When they do something we consider to be extremely evil, they don’t. They don’t feel bad, they are fine with it.
So, I can only leave the reasoning behind all this to God. God created three types of people, so we can compare and contrast us.";913;Creativity
Do you have a religious faith?;"I am a polytheist. It comes from my childhood, cattle-herding in the fields. In that environment, I could feel that all things have souls. García Márquez said something similar: “Things have a life of their own. It’s simply a matter of waking up their souls.” When I was herding cattle, I felt that the birds, the animals on the ground even the trees and grass, has a soul. Everything has feelings. So I think I’ve been a polytheist since childhood.
There is also this folk culture in our village. Not far from my hometown there was a famous writer, Pu Songling, during the Qing dynasty. He wrote about gods and spirits of various animals and plants, that can change into the shape of humans. This kind of belief is common in the countryside. I was often told such stories by my grandparents and neighbours.
That was when I was a child. Then I went to the city, where I learned many theories, including Marxist atheism and theories about various gods. And I thought that all the religious faiths are humanity’s spiritual wealth and should be studied from an academic perspective.
So now I think I have religious faith. I respect all religions that teach people to be kind. But I am no follower of any one religion.";913;Personal Characteristics
Our time is almost up. I want to ask, what does the Nobel Prize money mean to you?;"The money… When I was interviewed by Chinese reporters, they said: “You’ve been awarded such a large sum. What do you plan to do with it?” I jokingly said, “I plan to buy a bigger house in Beijing”, but someone immediately replied, “Not with that money.” Beijing’s real estate prices are too high. It may buy a 100 square-metre house.
Even without this money I can live comfortably and meet my basic needs but it will allow me to do more things. First of all, I won’t have to write quickly, or without rest, just to make a living. Now I have time to fine-tune my writing as I won’t be pressed to produce a large quantity. I can produce higher quality instead. Also, I can use the money to help those who need my help in my hometown my friends and relatives or villagers.";913;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Who has most inspired you as a writer?;I had of course the models of great writers and many … very important for me was the case of Flaubert for example. And the reason was that unlike all the writers who seemed geniuses since they were born, Flaubert had to work a lot in this life to achieve master works. So in his case talent was something that was the result of perseverance, discipline, the will to be a good writer. And when I … I love Flaubert since I read his first novel which was Madame Bovary, I read a lot about his life and I discovered that when he started he was not a genius at all, but he was a very, let’s say, common writer who wrote under the influence of his models and that his originality and really his talent is something that he achieved through discipline and very, very hard work. So that gave me the, let’s say, a kind a method for writing which I think was very, very important because I felt that I was not a genius at all so, that I wanted to write good books I had to work. And Flaubert was a great inspiration because he was a writer that had built his talent, his genius through very, very hard work, to a very deep commitment with his vocation, what he wanted to achieve. So he helped me enormously, not only by the beauty and the richness of his books but also because he managed not being a born genius, to build his genius through effort, commitment, perseverance, discipline.;915;Mentors (Role models)
How important are your origins in your writing?;"I was born in Peru, but I spend my first ten years, not in Peru but in Bolivia. Then when we returned to Peru, I lived in Piura, in Lima and then I have lived in Spain, in France, in England in the Unites States and I’ve been moving all the way. I think my Peruvian roots are very important for me because the first images that my memory has preserved are related to Peru. The kind of Spanish that I speak, is the Peruvian Spanish which of course is part of the Spanish but with certain nuances, with a certain music. And in this sense, I can say that I am a Peruvian writer, but I am not nationalistic, I am a declared enemy of all forms of nationalism. So, I think for me has been as important as to be born in Peru, to have spent so many years in France, so many years in England. I think all places in which I have lived have produced the writer that I am.
I think this is another very important knowledge that you receive being a writer, everything that you do is something that contributes to build your personality, to build your sensibility. I think this nationalistic vision is so limited, is so provincial, put you in such a restricted space to understand problems, to understand life that it is very, very important to leave it to yourself to build this kind of rationalistic or nationalistic perspective. And I think literature helps you a lot to overcome this very limited perspective of life. What you discover reading, you know, authors from different languages, from different traditions, is that the common denominator is much more important, much more larger than this localistic, regionalistic, nationalistic kind of perspective. So, in this sense I consider myself a citizen of the world and I think literature has helped me very much to have this attitude. I belong, of course, to Peru, but I belong to Latin America, I belong to the Spanish-speaking world, which means a lot of traditions and at the same time I feel in a way that I owe a lot to French culture or to English culture, to culture of my time. And I would like very much a world where people from all places consider themselves belonging to all places and achieve this kind of goal through culture. Culture is the great instrument to overcome the geographic, cultural or religious limitations that you have and understand the rest and participate of everything that is good, important, beautiful in other cultures, in other traditions, in other countries.";915;Motivation
What were your childhood dreams?;"I had the dream which at that time seemed totally impossible, to be a writer because I enjoy reading so much that I had the idea that life concentrated to tell stories, to invent stories, would be something absolutely fantastic. But it seemed impossible, because at that time there were not many Latin Americans who were only writers, so the writers that I knew were writers only for holidays or for weekends. They were professionals, there were lawyers, there were diplomats who had their lives completely consecrated to different professions and that people who practised literature as a hobby, an eventual hobby. And I didn’t want to be a writer only of Sundays and holidays. So, my dream at that time was to be a writer, but it seemed something impossible. Then I discovered that it was a city in the world in which apparently it was possible to be only a writer, and that was Paris. Since I was very young, I had the idea that I should organise my life in order to reach Paris, because in Paris it was possible to be only a writer. And in fact, something of the sort happened to me because when I finished university, I studied to be a lawyer and at the same time for pleasure, humanities. When I finished university, I got a grant to make a doctorate in Spain, in Madrid, I was in Madrid a year and a half and then I moved to Paris.
And finally, in Paris I could organise my life in order to, not only to be exclusively a writer, but to get jobs that let me free time to write and to read and. So it was in Paris that I became a professional writer as I had thought when I was a boy. And I lived seven years in Paris working as a journalist, as a teacher first and then as a journalist, but there were jobs that gave me a lot of free time so I could consecrate most of my time to write. Which I was very lucky because that what I was longing since I was very young. To write books, to write novels, to write short stories, to write plays, I thought it was the most extraordinary activity in the world. And it was in Paris in a way that I could organise more and more my life with enough free time, in order to consecrate most of my time to writing. I finished my first novel there, my second novel and I was writing my third novel when I moved from Paris to London where I went to teach. And teaching in a London university was something very pleasant because I taught literature, Latin American and Spanish literature, and it was a kind of job that let me a lot of free time for writing. I can say that I really became a real writer in Paris, in London, in Europe.";915;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
Does literature play a part in today’s world?;"Literature is of course something that gives you enormous pleasure. That is essential. Good literature is an extraordinary experience of pleasure, of entertainment, but it is not only that. I think good literature is something that enrich very much, your sensibility, your imagination and I think good literature, great literature develops in readers a critical attitude towards the world. When you return to real life after experiencing the beauty, the richness of war and peace, of Don Quijote, of Les Misérables by Victor Hugo, all very great worlds of literature, I think you are much more sensible to the deficiencies of real life to everything that is wrong because it’s unjust, unfair or brutal in the world as it is. So, I think this critical attitude towards the world which I think is essential to change things, to improve society and to correct the deficiencies of the real world, is something from what you are much more aware if you are impregnated of good literature. I think that is one of the most important social and political and moral effects of good literature. You understand better what is wrong in life, you discover that real life is never apt to fulfil your appetites, your desires, your dreams. I think this is an essential aspect of progress because if you don’t have citizens that are aware that things are wrong, that things are insufficient to fulfil the expectations of society, you are not mobilised to change things, to reform what is wrong and in this sense I think literature, in particular, and culture in general, play a fundamental role in what is civilisation, what is progress.
I am convinced that, for example, democratic culture, culture based on freedom, on respect of human rights, was something that was possible because we had people that were sensibilized by art, by literature, by culture in general, about the sufferance, the injustices, the inequalities, the abuses who were so extended in real life. So, I think literature is pleasure but it’s also a very important instrument to move forward in life. And that is the reason why all dictators have been always trying to create systems to control literature. They were aware that in literature they had an enemy, someone who was a way of resisting abuses and particularly this kind of total control that a dictatorship tried to impose in a society.";915;Role of literature
What do you think of the Swedish Academy’s motivation for your Nobel Prize?;I think it is true that one of my major preoccupations has been power. Not only political, but also social, economic power, probably because I was born in a country and in a region in which power were synonymous of brutality. We have had so many kinds of dictatorship in Latin America. Things are changing, fortunately, but when I was young, when I was a boy, Latin America was a region full of military dictatorships and that was synonymous with brutality, with brutal imposition of ideas, of attitudes, of behaviours. So, this is a kind of theme or subject that reappear constantly in my work and I think in my stories there is always a great respect and admiration of people that in spite of this kind of environment in which forced brutality are the main reasons to behave and to act and fulfil your daily life, are able to resist, to fight and to demonstrate that this is not /- – -/, that things can change, that life can get better, that societies can be freer than they are. And I think in this kind of fighting against the established order enrich themselves, enrich, let’s say, a superior kind of moral value. I think this kind of people are the heroes of my stories and I think in a way this is more or less synthetized in this description, of the reasons for why the Swedish Academy gave me the Nobel Prize.;915;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Do you have any advice for aspiring writers?;Work very hard, enjoy what you are doing. I think it is essential when you have a literary vocation to feel that writing, practicing this vocation, you are receiving the most important rewards for what you are doing. And I think if you work with this kind of feeling, it is much more possible that what you’ll write will be good literature, that you will succeed as a writer. That if you write in a mechanical way, as if you were practicing any other kind of work or job. I think writing or composing or painting is also a job, of course, but it’s a very special kind of job in which practicing the job you are already receiving a fantastic kind of reward for what you do. You are doing something in which you are realising yourself, accomplishing yourself something that was a very important necessity of your own personality in order to be, how can I say, loyal with yourself. That would be my advice to a young writer – enjoy what you do, be very serious self-critic of yourself and receive this kind of compliments that is to be satisfied with what you are doing.;915;Advice for young writers
How did you react to being awarded the Nobel Prize?;"It was a very big surprise. I had really discarded the possibility of receiving the Nobel Prize. I was in New York at that time because I was teaching at Princeton but living in New York. I usually start to work very early, it was five in the morning I think. I was preparing a lesson that I had to deliver the next day. It was, I think, 5 a.m. and suddenly I saw my wife appear where I was working, with the telephone and with a very strange attitude, like she was having a kind of mystical trance. She didn’t say a word and she gave me the telephone. And what was funny was I thought immediately, someone in the family is very ill or is dead, because it was 5 in morning. And then I took the telephone, and I couldn’t hear anything because there were all kind of electric, you know, sounds, but suddenly I heard very far away “Swedish Academy”. And then I was cut. So, I said to my wife, “He has said Swedish Academy” and she was still in state of trance, of mystical trance. And immediately after, the telephone rang again and this time I could speak, and I was told “I am the secretary of the Swedish Academy and you have received the Nobel Prize in Literature”. And I was so surprised that I could only react with a stupid question. I said, “Is that official?” and I was told “It will be in half an hour. Open the radio and the television and you will see.” And that was all, and I was talking to my wife and I said, “Do you think this is true?”.
And I remember that we were in Rome, several years ago, in which there was a fantastic misunderstanding because an Italian writer had received a call like this, and he was naïve enough to call the press to say, “I have been told that I have received the Nobel Prize” and it wasn’t true. It was a joke which had been played on him of his so-called friends. And we were talking, and I said, “And what about if this is some kind of joke?”, like the joke that was done to Moravia, Alberto Moravia, you know. But then we were hesitating if we would call our children, or we expected the half an hour, but finally we decided that it was true and so we called two sons and our daughter. They were very surprised of course. And at 6 o’clock New York time, it was given the news everywhere, in radios, in TV. And what was even more incredible, is that half an hour later, I had at least twenty newspaper men at the door of my apartment in New York, 6.30 in the morning. Mostly from Nordic TVs and radio stations, Dutch, Norwegian, Sweden, it was incredible, you know. I am still thinking, is this true or a kind of fairy tale, you know. That I have been living in since.";915;Impact of Nobel on you
My name is Horace Engdahl, I’m the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy and I have here beside me the Laureate for Literature of the year 2008, Jean-Marie Le Clézio. I will speak in English here – brings us immediately on the question of languages – we were asked by the director of the Nobel Web service to do that, and we have agreed. Of course your literary language is French, but apart from that, which are your languages? You speak English because your father was a British citizen, you also maybe speak Spanish because you’ve spent a lot of years in Mexico, and I’ve read somewhere that at a certain stage of your career you even learnt Embera Indian language, is that true?;"Yes, personally I belong to a dual culture because my family is from Mauritius, and as you may know in Mauritius the official language is English, the current language is Creole and the literary language is French, but I do not speak Creole, I speak very little Creole, I would not try to speak with you in Creole.
I wouldn’t understand, It’s no use!
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: So I’m used to shifting languages because my father used to speak to us, to my brother and I, he used to speak in English. He wanted us to be quite fluent in English, especially when he was trying to correct our behaviour, he would do that in English.
I see.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: And then of course I have lived in other countries, in Latin America, I learnt to speak what they call the Espanol /- – -/, the Spanish from the streets …
Oh, that’s not bad.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: … which is not literary Spanish. After that I lived for some time in the forest with the Embera Indians and I had to learn some Embera language which is totally different from the indo-European languages. So I …
Did you arrive speaking that language?
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes, I could speak fairly fluently, but they have also a literary language for tales or stories or for myths and this language I never spoke, it’s too complicated, so I spoke a very simplified Embera language, probably a rather simplified Spanish and a not too simplified but not too colloquial English. In fact I think I’m better in reading English than speaking English. My English is closer to the literary English and I’m not very familiar with jokes in English or with, you know, with small talk in English.
No. That’s always terribly difficult in any language that you’re not born with, I suppose.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes, yes, definitely.
It’s probably the sign of having really learnt a foreign language that you can laugh without looking at the people sitting beside you when you’re in a theatre for instance.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes.";917;Literature and Language
I’m not sure I could do that in English either really, but coming to this question in another perspective, I feel that today there is a tendency in many parts of the world, in the Western world particularly, to look upon English as a vehicle language. It’s used more and more in all circumstances and there are several realms of research that have been completely taken over by English. In international conferences in the European Union etc we tend to be more and more mono-lingual and even if … I know that the French are defending their positions with a lot of conviction, they find it increasingly hard to do so. But it’s odd and it’s very apparent if you, like me, belong to a small group that has as one of its main tasks to study world literature, to read books from all over the world, to look at the development of universal literature in a broad perspective. It’s quite apparent that there is no such thing as a universal language in the world of literature. The only universal language in literature is translation, and you said earlier this morning on a press conference that for you it’s not only the French literature tradition that is the basis of your writing, but it’s also to a large extent books that you read in translations, English, American books, Scandinavian books, books from lots of other countries. Could you comment a bit on that? Which are the most important non-French writers that sort of belong to you through your literary schooling?;"In fact I was told that in Sweden 80% of the population speaks English. This is amazing if you compare with the French people for instance. French speaking people or Spanish speaking people, where I suppose in Mexico they hardly speak, I would say 10% of the population will probably manage with English, but most of the population is ignorant of English. And for the French people it might be worse than 10% even, might find only 5% of people in France are able to have a conversation or read in English, so in that matter I would say that Sweden is probably ahead of all the countries.
On the other hand, what is amazing, which is very strange, is that the countries where most translations occur are not English speaking countries, for instance Korea is probably ahead of all countries for translations. Books are being translated from all languages, even very … even first novels or poems are translated into Korean very quickly, probably the same in Japan, and it’s very likely it would be close to that number in Sweden because Sweden has a good interest in translations.
I think it’s slightly more than 50% of all books published in this country that are translations in the literary field.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: And not all from English, they are from all languages, and on the contrary, when you go to the United States and look at the books stalls and you see what is sold in book stalls most, if not all, books are from English speaking persons. Very few books are translated, so it’s a kind of a paradox that the, what you would call the mono-lingual empire, is not interested at all in other languages, in other countries and trying to translate into this language.
No I think that …
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: And on the other hand all the countries where English is not so much spoken are the countries where people are interested in the English literature. So it’s probably an answer to what you were saying, that mono-culture is dangerous because it tends to ignore the other countries, it tends to be … reduce you then to be closed on itself, and to have no openness on the outside world.";917;Environment
As I understand your relationship to French culture, to your own language, to your own literature, is not the typical one that you find with a French writer. I mean, I’ve been reading a lot of French writers and even if they often deny this fact quite often it’s so obvious that the very centre of their work is Paris, that’s where everybody wants to go, that’s where everybody wants to make a name, and there are certain rules and there are certain circles that you have to make yourself known by and you have to triumph on a certain scene. And this has been going on in very much the same way for hundreds of years, but somehow you don’t seem to belong to this play, this race, you have to a large extent even ignored it, I should say, could you comment on that? Why did you never quite go to Paris?;"It’s a long story, I was born in the south of France, but my family was, as I mentioned, from Mauritius, so I was raised with the belief that I was in France. I was there but I was not from there, that I was from some other place. And when I was a child I tried to explain to my fellow students where I came from and they were not interested in the least bit, they were not interested at all in the Mauritian part of myself, and they even ignored that because at that time it was not so fashionable to be from Mauritius. So they ignored where it was and they thought it was St Maurice, a kind of suburb of Nice, but they could not understand why I was behaving in such a different way.
My father also tried to give us the … not an English education, but to value the English literature as well as the French literature, so he gave us a lot of English books to read and I must say I’ve read Gulliver’s Travels in the original, not in translation, and some ways my culture was really different from the others. So I did not feel so much attracted by the umbilical literature by the, you know, by the secret of the secrets by Paris, I didn’t feel so much attracted by that, I felt that being in Nice I was in, belonged more to the Mediterranean Sea than to the grey skies of Paris. And having Mauritian ancestors and Mauritian family I was more attracted by this kind of other world which was not exotic for me, it was the normal world, and I was using some Creole worlds in French which were not understood by the others, and my references were not in Paris at all. And in fact when I began to read the modern literature I was reading more American novels than French novels, I discovered very late the new “nouveax roman” and those writers, and to them I preferred the, I would say, the Jewish writers from New York, I felt they were much more inventive in the way they wrote stories like /- – -/ or Salinger, Salinger especially was very attractive for me.
Yes, you mentioned him.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Though he was describing a life I didn’t know really, it was the décor he was describing, I didn’t know anything about it, but I preferred the way he was telling the story, he was …
You said that Catcher in the Rye was an important book to you.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes, Catcher in the Rye because it was such an overwhelming way of telling a story. You had to be inside the body of a 14 year old and you were already 19 or 20, so already very far from that, and this man succeeded in making you feel you were in the body of a 14 year old, it was amazing, and no new novel in France was able to offer such a travel, such an experiment, and the humour, the good humour in the English literature was …I felt very attracted to that, and I felt like French literature was lacking cruelly this sense of humour, this distance. Very few writers had managed it and most writers in France were very serious, for me too serious.
So for all these reasons I didn’t feel very much interested by the Paris intelligentsia and the small chapels which were still alive when I was 20 years old. At first I refused to go to Paris and my publisher was asking for a picture so I went to an automatic picture and I sent him 4 ugly pictures and said I live in Nice, my father is English, my mother is French, that was all the details for us I was sending at the time, and they were asking me to come to Paris, and I was trying to invent a pretext not to go there. I think in a way I was afraid of Paris, I was afraid of getting to a foreign country, you know, to a place where I would not speak the language, a place where everything would be very intelligent and very serious and I had to give proofs of my seriousness which I was unable to do.";917;Creativity
But your first book Le procès-verbal came out in 1963 was very well received I understand?;"Yes it was, yes it was, but in fact it was better received by Europe I would say because I was, when I was 22 years old the manuscript was offered for a prize which doesn’t exist anymore which was called the Formentor Prize and this prize was awarded by publishers from all Europe, so all the publishers had to translate this book and then to publish it in their … and they would publish it, and unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I didn’t have this award, I didn’t get the Formentor Prize. The prize though was very interesting, it was a stay in the Island of Formentora for 15 days. The hotel was paid and the travel was paid and it was, for me, a terrific prize.
But I didn’t get it, it was Uwe Johnson, a German writer, who got that prize, but still as my book had been translated in all those languages, in German, French, Italian, not French, in Germany, this is a lapsus, in German, English, Italian, Spanish and some other languages, Portuguese, then it was ready to be known in Europe, so at once I got a European public and this was a great chance for me because I didn’t have to go through the triumph arc of the French Quartier Latin, I didn’t have to pay my respects to the critics in Paris, I was already known in Europe. That was a good thing, that was luck.";917;Environment
Still, I mean reading a book, if we move a bit ahead now in the list of your books, we come to a remarkable thing like L’extase matérielle. I find it very hard to imagine that book written in any other language but the French, this mixture of very good prose and “discours” which seems to be so very French, can you give us an idea of how you decide such a book, what made you write it in this way?;"It’s a funny thing, because in fact it was not meant to be a book, at first it was meant to be a play, a theatre play, and it was the time where the Cinéma vérité, I don’t know the name of this in English Cinéma vérité, I need a name…
Describe what it is?
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: It’s a time where there were all those experiments with cinema, improvisation and there would not be any script. There was a writer who did that, Paul Bowles, he wrote a book which was the result of a discussion with a young Berber boy and this was recorded on a tape recorder and published as the raw material. This was very fashionable at that time, and with a friend of mine in Nice we were gathering in a small room and with the tape recorder and we were speaking and this would normally be a play, but in fact it would have been a terribly boring play because the subjects were very abstract, sometimes very philosophical or pretended to be very philosophical, and in other places they were kind of aggressive also, say political background. So eventually we renounced to do that play, but instead of go into the recorded material then I was trying to remember what we had talked about and I wrote it down, evening after evening, and it came out to be that book which was a mixture as you said of all this, some philosophy, some imagination, some poetry, some…";917;Motivation
Well then, if we move ahead a bit quickly now and come to something that to me looks like the sort of turning point in your career as a writer, the novel which is in French it’s called Désert, Desert, which came out in 1980 and was a big success and seems to have been the first book to give you a wide readership, not only in France but in many other countries. It was also, I think, celebrated by the French Academy which is something very unexpected in your case, you got a prize, I don’t remember the exact name of it but it’s a sort of novel prize that’s given by the French Academy. How did you come to write that book which is so different from your early books?;"I think I reached at that time a crisis because I had been writing on myself, and to the point I felt disgusted by writing, and I, at that time, I went to live in the forest with some American Indians in the East of Panama in the Darien forests. I spent around three years there without writing, just living, moving and watching people and talking to them, and being pretty useless for the people themselves, but I came to understand all my errors there, it was a kind of psychoanalysis without any psychiatrists, I had to do that myself.
A sort of pilgrimage almost.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Not really, I was not prepared to what was happening there, I was not expecting anything, I was just attracted by the extraordinary beauty of the place and of the people, they were extremely beautiful people, and some of them, not all of them, but some of them were for me really like, I would say like teachers or like mentors. They helped me a lot to change my mind, so when I came out of there I got married, which was a change, and then I decided to speak about other people, not about me, this was really the change, I had to shift from myself to the others and from there, some of the critics were very indignant saying that I had …
You had betrayed yourself.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: … I had been a traitor, in fact I was a traitor to myself …
Yes, I remember that.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: But it’s a good thing to be a traitor to yourself when you can’t bear yourself any more, you have to survive, and literature can offer a good survival, it’s a …";917;Motivation
In this book there is a violent clash between the north, an ancient north African culture that is based on the desert people, and the French culture or the culture of Europe, we can say the urbanised Europe. What were your sources in describing this traditional north African culture?;"I wrote the first version of that book when I was 14 years old because at that time I really enjoyed writing adventure stories, so I wrote a first version of that novel which was called The White Sheik, I was inventing a Sheik who was resisting to the French in Morocco.
But that’s not altogether an invention, there was such a war of resistance in the early 20th century?
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes, so after that when I was married to Jemia, to my wife, I found out that she was the descendent of a leader in what was called the Rio de Oro or Western Sahara, the Spanish colony south of Morocco, and I read a lot about that man whose name was Ma al-Aynayn which means “the water from the eyes”, because he had watery eyes, he was afflicted by that, so this man was a leader, he was a Sufi philosopher and a leader, a very, very astonishing man who tried to resist both Spaniards and French and tried to expel the imperialist forces from the land.
That was before the first world war I think.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: That was the … it began in 1902 and it lasted until around 1911, 1912, and he died without seeing the victory. He was defeated by the French army which was overrunned, he was with his army, he was fighting with one very simple guns against the machine guns and especially the German machine guns which were sold to the French army at the time, so it was an unequal fight and he was defeated, but I was really attracted by this resistance spirit and it was very convenient for me because it gave me the impression that literature could be used for describing something else than just exotism or personal problems, that it could deal also with a movement.
It doesn’t at all give the effect of exotism when you read it because … Especially in the beginning of the book when you’re following this march through the desert, and these rites that take place in order to strengthen the spirit of resistance in this group of men, women and children which we are witnessing. It’s my impression that you approach a sort of sacred language, it’s the language of religious ceremony really, you come very close to that. I won’t call you a religious writer just because of that, but you have a sort of … there is a power, an attraction in it that very much resembles …
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: I was attracted by this figure because he was indeed not only a political leader, he was also a religious leader which meant at that time a good knowledge not only of religion but also in mathematics, in astronomy, the Sufi philosophers were well acquainted with sciences as well. He had a huge library, his personal library, which was probably a moving library because he had to change places, and which probably was dispersed, was liquidated after his defeat, and this kind of figure was, for me, a good example of what human beings can be, what sort of models they can be, because he was characterised by the French politics at that time as a fanatic, but he was not a fanatic. He was a very peaceful man, a very religious, peaceful, in some ways very modern, very tolerant, nothing to do with the present times, fundamentalism or fanatism, he was a good example of what was /- – -/ by the French forces and might have been different solution to the after colonialism, he would be, he would have been, definitely.";917;Creativity
And then you, when you move on in the book, and you arrive at our own time and you have this main character Lalla who is a young girl whose ancestors were among the followers of this /- – -/, though she doesn’t know that, she just feels it somehow, and she goes across the Mediterranean and she comes to Marseilles I suppose … then the language of the book changes altogether it’s a new style, it’s a new approach, there’s a new way of writing that goes with this discovery of the urban world, of Europe, which is really like the kingdom of death, it’s like entering a world where no-one is really alive, that’s my impression in reading the book. This topic, image of our country, how did you come to that?;"Yes, well in fact you know when, what I really wanted to say or what was my main preoccupation is that when you travel in Europe you very often come, you very often meet very ordinary people, and those people can be workers in the street, they can be people plastering houses or repairing roofs, they could be people serving in the restaurants, and you don’t know their stories. But some of them belong to very ancient families, they have this kind of noble background which has nothing to do with being born noble but it’s the kind of noble heritage they have, and you simply ignore it, and those people are living in terrible situations.
They are renting poor rooms in very bad parts of the city, they are confronted to violence every day and they see the worst part of our modern civilisation, and it’s surely very difficult to compare what they see to what they are, they are refined and they have a very elegant and very significant family background. And when they are in Europe they are isolated and sometimes they are compelled to live with criminals or with the destructive parts of the population, sometimes they are even by chance taken and put into jail and they don’t understand that. So it’s this contradiction between what they are and what they look like, what they seem to us and what they are really in their soul.
And I suppose that’s in a way an allegory of global relationships because …
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes it is, it is.
… across distances we tend to look at some foreign people in that way.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: I was stricken by a sight when I was going to England, it was around the late 50’s, I used to go very often to England, I was a student at the university of Bristol, so I was taking the boat because at that time you were not taking the plane. And when I was taking the boat on the same boat going between Calais and Dover, on the main deck of the boat you were seeing a population coming from Africa, and some of these people had travelled for months before reaching that boat, they were trying to get into England to find jobs in England. It was the beginning of what was called after that the general immigration, at that time we were not speaking of immigrants, we were just speaking of workers, and those people, some of those people, they looked so dignified, they were coming to England dressed in their robes, African robes, with the hat made of leopard skin, and they did not speak a word of English.
They had on their face the scars from their tribes in Africa and they looked, and they looked so afraid on the deck of the boat, and once I tried to speak to some of them and I tried to speak in English, in pigeon English, and for some reason they did not understand. They looked so frightened and I was asking to myself why are those people who look like kings, why are they so frightened to come to Europe? And after that I got the answer that most of the people thought that they had to go because of economical reasons. Bbut they knew, or they were persuaded that most of them would die there, they were going to their deaths, and they were convinced that England was a place where they would be killed, but they had to go there to escape hunger and economical difficulties in Nigeria or Uganda. But they still were convinced that maybe they would die there, this is amazing, because generally the Europeans think about themselves as living in a very safe place and for Africans it was a terribly dangerous place to go to.
Maybe in some ways it was also.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Maybe in some ways it was. So this, probably those situations gave me the need to write, to try to change my personal thing to …
You see this French city from the inside on this immigrant that actually it’s completely foreign to everything she sees.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: The same thing was happening in France for the people coming from North Africa, the general opinion for the French people was that most of them are criminals, most of these people coming from north Africa are criminals, and for the north Africans they were getting into a country of criminals, so it was …
Complete misunderstanding from both sides.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: From both sides.";917;Creativity
I have to ask you before we get to the close a little about your latest book because it’s apparent that if we move onto the books you’ve written in this century, you have begun to exploit the history of your own family in a way that you didn’t do before. Of course this started in the 90’s with books like Onitsha who is partly a story about your experience of Africa and your father’s experience of Africa but not quite, and a book like La Quarantaine also has a lot of material that has to do with Mauritius and your family background, and this wonderful story of, was it your grandfather Jacques, who saw Rimbaud coming out of the bistro at the corner of Rue Madame in Saint-Sulpice – that becomes a sort of legend that you have to follow on, but as you read these books, Révolutions, for instance, or L’Africain and now Ritournelle de la faim you realise that you’re not quite telling the real story, those are not facts, this is still a novel. It’s sometimes called a semi-autobiographical but that’s a rather elusive term I think. Which is the relationship actually in those books between fiction and actuality;"The first books I was writing were closer to autobiography because I was, as I told, speaking about myself and I was overwhelmed by this need to explain who I was and what were my reactions to the modern world, to the city, to the violence of the city. And when I decided to change and to speak about the others naturally the subjects would be the closest person I would know, and those closest persons were from my family, but I didn’t use my family really, I was not trying to give a detailed relation of what my family had been, what they had experimented, I was more interested by the kind of, not symbol, but a kind of exemplary history they had been through. One of my grandfathers was a judge in Mauritius, was sent to a very isolated island, /- – -/ and didn’t enjoy so much life there, so he invented the story of this treasure and I found this was a good idea to replace a boring reality by something which would give an aim to his life, and he was really a prisoner of this dream and was trying to reach, to find the treasure which in my mind didn’t exist, was just an invention …
So you transform that in your book to another kind of treasure?
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: I thought it was a good theme for a novel, trying to find something which doesn’t exist, it generally could be a resumé of most novels, most heroes or anti-heroes start trying to find something which doesn’t exist.
But your hero finds something else.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes of course, because you always find something else, and I suppose my grandfather also found something else which was the love of the Rodriguan people, he was … then he went to Rodriguez Island and got in so good relations with the people, I happened to meet a very old man who knew my grandfather and accompanied my grandfather when he was doing his research for this treasure and this man told me in Creole that my grandfather was … as soon as he was getting to Rodriguez he would take off his jacket, his celluloid collar and be in sleeves, and then would sing all the time. I can’t imagine my grandfather singing, he was a judge after all, can you imagine a judge singing? And then some other people in my family had other experiences which were formly symbolic of those times, and Ritounelle de la faim, the ultimate novel I published I was…
You make your mother slightly younger I think in…
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes, much younger, 10 years younger, because my idea was what is it to live a war when you are 20 years old, when you are ready to live and you’re ready to be happy, to marry and to lead a peaceful and a life full of love. And then war comes and you are separated from your love and everything is crumbling everywhere, your family is falling down and they are losing their money, they are losing their properties and so this was the idea, because I feel that nowadays we are in some places of the world people are living this, exactly this, we are not aware of it but in some places …
Yes certainly.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: … women are separated from their love and I was, I wanted also to speak about the people who are not heroes in wars, because I hardly can think that a general is a hero, I think the real heroes are the survivors, the civilians who survive wars, the women who find food and try to escape from bombings and try to survive with their children. Very, very marvellous writer in Korea, Hwang Sok-yong, who wrote a book called Monsieur Han, Mr Han, … and he tells about his crossing of a river escaping from North Korea to South Korea in the middle of bombs, and he described the same situation, so this type of situation happens again and again and is still happening now.
Well, shall we stop here? 
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes.
I’m most satisfied and I hope you are too.
Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio: Yes. It was a very pleasant moment, I could have …";917;Creativity
Can you remember what impelled you to write it?;"Yes, of course. Yes, it’s because I’d been saying that I’m a writer and all this and I had short stories. But in fact, I hadn’t written a novel and there was in fact that moment – I was working in a lawyer’s office. I said: Enough now, I’m going to write this novel. And I went in to see my boss, Mr Hill, and I said: Mr Hill, I’m going to leave you and I’m going to write a novel, at which of course he fell about laughing because of how I left him. And I wrote a novel but while this sounds quite … we now embark on 10 years of difficulty.
… what the whites couldn’t stand, ever, was somebody who didn’t think they were wonderful …
So it was all based on a little newspaper cutting which I kept because it said so much about what I had been brought up in. See, what the whites couldn’t stand, ever, was somebody who didn’t think they were wonderful, who didn’t fit in. And I’d seen that so often. I hadn’t almost really thought about it. And among the things that went into that book was a woman on the next farm, a new one, who had all the farmers scandalised, a farmer’s wife, because she let her cook boy button her dress up to the back and brush her hair. Now as a girl, I couldn’t see. I mean I knew it was absolutely beyond the pale. So you see when I have to try and explain why this cook murdered his mistress, I have to find something pretty difficult.";918;Life
And the newspaper cutting that you mentioned, what did that say?;It said something like, I have it somewhere … it’s so and so’s cook of so and so murdered so and so. And there’s no motive for the crime.;918;Family/Home Environment
And so something quite similar to the sort of, the little bit which actually starts the novel?;"Yes, that kind of thing, probably the same thing. But you have to ask why because, why did he murder her? So when I thought of the sheer unkindness and lack of ordinary human feeling at a lot of the … particularly the women used to the boys, you understood it. I mean it was easy to understand. So we have my black cook, who’d actually had some human feelings for Mary Turner. And then suddenly treated like a dog and thrown out of any kind of possibility of affection. So that was it. All I had to do was to remember the farmer’s wife and the voices when they said … she actually lets the cook boy button up her dress … You have, as a child, you have to really think hard about this. It doesn’t, it’s perfectly evident to them of course what it was all about, but not to a girl.
So, OK, years and years later I wrote it. And that book was centred in the middle of the war, so all the U-boats that went to England twice and was rejected and they came back for a third time. And I looked at it and I thought: My god, this book is two thirds too long. It was perfectly, you know, I could suddenly see it. So I cut out the third that nobody needed and it turned into The Grass is Singing, just like that. And now people say what a beautiful structure it has. They only knew how arbitrary that was. So then of course a friend sold it to a publisher, /—/ wouldn’t publish it because it was too abrasive. I don’t know how many times I’ve been told that. Like The Golden Notebook, too abrasive. So then he didn’t publish it and it sat there in Johannesburg.
And years passed and I came to England and I sent short stories to Curtis Brown, the publisher and Juliette O’Hare wrote and said: Have I got a novel? And I wrote and said: Yes, but it was bought for by Johannesburg. She asked to see the … whatever there was, it wasn’t very much, probably half a page. And she said she’d never seen anything so disgraceful in all her life. And she sent a telegram, remember telegram, to him and said: Release this writer at once or I shall shame you before your entire … Not that he would have cared, he was a crook. So she got the book and sold it over the weekend to Michael Joseph. And then, you see, it did very well before publication, but I was such an innocent, you’d never believe it. They would ring up and say: We are republishing before publication and I’d say: Oh yes. I thought everybody had this. So then he came out and it got, no, it got good reviews. We started having the then progress of a novel you get good reviews, and then … it all took five or six books. Now of course it all happens in one go, doesn’t it?
Yes.
Doris Lessing: So …
I mean it seems like … I was re-reading it before coming to see you and it does feel like not just the voices of those women, but it does feel as if it’s got real shards of your own very particular memories in it. I mean the descriptions, the sort of the scenery, I suppose you would call in a banal way. It feels like a book which I remember when I first read it, absolutely caught a particular world that …
Doris Lessing: Now gone.
Yes.
Doris Lessing: The world as a white farmer, it’s all gone.";918;Creativity
And I’m interested if you were conscious of this at the time. The heroine, the protagonist, she’s hardly heroic in it. The interesting thing about it seems to be that she is where a lot of our interest lies, but she’s also in some ways quite obnoxious I suppose, or she behaves badly. And you have a strange mixture of sympathy and disgust.;"You see, she was modelled on someone I knew very well – a town girl. Hard to imagine in Africa – a town girl who hated to be out of the street. She was a woman I used to watch her putting her skirt up, afraid of an ant going across her leg or something like this. And I thought, I remember thinking, supposing she landed as a wife, and one of these farmers wives, she’d go crazy – I was thinking something like that. So I made her do this. She married and of course she did go crazy because she couldn’t stand the bush, the felt, she couldn’t bear it. And she’s not the only one I’ve known who couldn’t bear it either. They go out as if they’re still in a street somewhere and live as if they are still on a street.
So you have to ask why on earth do they go and marry?
And somebody told me the other day that they could quote some people from Australia, women of the same kind. So you have to ask why on earth do they go and marry? Well, look, she wants to get married. This is a society where people have to get married. And even now they should get married. But then, if you weren’t married by the time you were 20, there was something very wrong with you. So she wasn’t married. She was everybody’s best friend. I remember the original. She was everybody’s pal. And none of this is a good prognosis for marriage.";918;Creativity
The books that followed that, did that … did the success of The Grass is Singing sort of make you think: Right, I can now be a writer. This is going to be my career, I can actually survive doing this?;"But I was surviving. It’s interesting. I’ve just seen today a resume of my life which said that I was working as a shorthand typist. Of course I wasn’t. They can’t believe that I actually lived on what I earned, which I did for years you know. It just … I had been writing for 10 years when somebody pointed out I was earning the average wage for a worker. Whatever it was. I can’t remember what it was at that, the last year. And you see, we didn’t think then the way people think now about if you write a book, then you have to get a lot of money.
Yes.
Doris Lessing: It’s all gone. We just took it for granted we wouldn’t have much money. We didn’t have any and it didn’t bother us particularly. But nobody had any money, that’s the point, nobody was rich. And nobody was longing for a big refrigerator and two cars. We just didn’t. We thought it was all very vulgar and bourgeois of them.";918;Motivation
So does that mean that the books you were writing in the sort of 1950s say that you felt quite free to write what you wanted. You didn’t have to worry about trying to please a publisher or please a public?;No. I had a very good. I wrote short stories, which no publisher then was pleased about. And then I just set off, one after the other and this is what I was doing and I don’t think I said: Now I am a writer. But I was, I suppose. It’s just it was different, it was completely different then.;918;Motivation
And in these novels, Martha gets involved, as I think you did, in Marxism, in communist politics, doesn’t she? Did you sort feel looking back that that was kind of a rich material for fiction?;One book, it was A Ripple from the Storm which is very, very close to what happened. But the joke is you see, this is a bit of an indictment, this the communist group in Southern Rhodesia. But a friend of mine said that a student of his had read this and was so amazed with the wonder of it all that he went off to join, I’ve forgotten what group or other to discover the same thing.  And I thought this would put anybody off ever joining anything. So, but no. It’s the kind of thing that happens.;918;Creativity
And I mean, formally it’s quite a … I mean, it’s a fairly extraordinary book now, but it must have been a very strange one, I think, for its first readers in all these different kind of … these multiple narratives reflecting different aspects of the protagonist’s experience. I mean, do you remember sort of devising that?;"Oh, very clearly. But first of all there was a great demand in all the newspapers that the novel needed to have a new form. This was in the air, right. So when I was working this one out, because the essence of a Golden Notebook is I think I said before recently. The second sentence in a book, as far as I’m concerned, everything is cracking up. I thought this is what I was writing about. But not the feminists who said it was all about feminism. So anyway, so I was really teased about that for a long time.
It was very just ready to explode, that book.
Anyway, so how do I convey this fragmentation? I don’t know, I remember I got these notebooks and I remember actually imagining the notebooks. I remember that, the notebooks on their different tables. And it wrote very fast. It was very just ready to explode, that book. And it was very … You see what nobody now is going to remember, or care about, every time the telephone rang, somebody was leaving a communist party, committing suicide, taking you to religion, just becoming a famous businessman. It was an extraordinary time, it really was, and you see the party listen to me, after all these years. The party was such a strong experience for everybody. There was this utopia hatching itself out over there and a lot of people believed it, you know. Oh well, never mind, life goes on without me.
And did you, I mean, did you get much kind of reaction from …?
Doris Lessing: Yes, I got the most appalling reviews. Now people come and see me and say: I’ve just been reading your reviews in Collindale or wherever they are, and they’re terrible. And I say: Well yes, I remember. This balls breaker, this is a great favourite expression and a man hater.
Harold Bloom said it was a crusade against the male sex.
Doris Lessing: Has he said it recently?
No, I think he said it quite a while back.
Doris Lessing: Oh well, you see that’s the kind of thing they said. So what really made me cross was not one of these precious reviews noticed it had quite an interesting form. They didn’t even notice it. They were so upset by what I was saying apparently, they couldn’t bother to see anything else. Ever since then I’ve had a certain attitude towards reviews. They … it is possible for them not to be very bright, you know. So anyway, that was going on and I got … But some people sort of championed me in a very positive and good way like Edwin Muir, the poet who wrote to me a long letter about The Golden Notebook. And various people who said: Take no notice of them, they’re just dumb, you know.
So, and then time passed after all. The book had come out in all these different countries. America, everywhere by then. Except of course precious France and precious Germany who wouldn’t publish it because it was too abrasive. Can you imagine for 10 years? Everybody else was perfectly happy with The Golden Notebook, but no, they wouldn’t publish it. So, you know, one has to have, what can I say? This kind of experience gives one a certain attitude to places and people. Suddenly they publish it in the feminist days as a feminist document.";918;Creativity
So the sections of conventional third person narrative in the novel, the bits which aren’t written in Anna’s notebooks are titled Free women and when I was re-reading it recently, that came to sound almost sarcastic actually.;"It’s meant to be sarcastic. Because what it is is a conventional little novel, fitted into the West. And one of the things I was saying, I was trying to express the pain I think some writers feel. That all this experience, and it can be very rich and tumultuous experience, going into a tiny narrative. There was a tiny narrative. And there was the thick experience that went into it. So, and then of course, it all cracked up. Because don’t forget, I was seeing people cracking up at that time. When the communist party was shattered by Khrushchev and his speech, it was terrible for some communists. You know some people, their whole lives came to an end.
Particularly, for the working class boys from the East End, from the young communist league. This was their university. They learnt everything there. Suddenly, it’s all not true. Well, even now I’m sorry for them, it was such a terrible thing to happen. I mean for less, what is the word, tougher characters, their lives had come to an end. Some people were very sorry like I was that Khrushchev hadn’t said more than he did. Because some of us, knowing what was going on at the Soviet Union thought that he could have said a lot more. You know, it was quite a muted complaint that he gave about Stalin. So while some people were saying: Oh no, this couldn’t possibly be true, it’s all a capitalist press, which is what most orthodox communists said, other people would say: For god’s sake, why didn’t he do it properly. But, you see, it’s taken many, many years for it to come out.";918;Role of literature
I suppose this is a trick of time that now people think of The Golden Notebook, I mean the politics you’re talking about is sort of perhaps hidden history to lots of its new readers and they notice the sexual politics, I suppose, of it, much more than they notice what you’ve been saying about communism and the end of lots of peoples’ faith in that. And they notice, they notice I suppose, things about … I mean, how it seems an extraordinary satire on actually the behaviour of men. That’s one thing I think I noticed recently. I mean the men in the novel are a pretty ghastly lot aren’t they?;"You said they were a ghastly lot. I’ve never seen it for how a … You know, they seem to me that some of them are just normal men.
Yes.
Doris Lessing: Behaving normally. I’m sure you’re not like that. But …
There’s a lot, there are a lot of, I mean, it may be a reflection of the times.
Doris Lessing: You mean they were unfaithful to their wives.
There were a lot of married men in it, aren’t there, who are Anna and her friend Molly.
Doris Lessing: Yes.
They’re always ending up with these or getting the chance to end up briefly with these married men who are looking for a little bit of sort of, a little Friesian but without actually wanting to leave their sort of nice bourgeois lives.
Doris Lessing: Well, that seems to me nothing but the Paris realism. You have two women living alone, quite attractive women. In a society which I think was a pretty free society. I’m using it ironically. And so what do you expect to happen? I mean, I don’t want to be unduly cynical. So yes, anyway, what have I forgotten, I’ve lost my thread now.
Just thinking about the various kind of minor male characters in the novel. Anna Wolfe ends up being a marriage guidance counsellor doesn’t she?
Doris Lessing: I thought that was funny.
That is funny, yes.
Doris Lessing: And she’s the … Molly is in, I don’t know what, she’s doing something like that. Because don’t forget they were communists and waiting for the utopia to explode on the world.
Well, Molly having criticised marriage ends up getting married again.
Doris Lessing: Well, there you are, you see. This is … So, well I thought all of that was very funny. You just want to contrast it of what they were like. Communists fighting for the new world and look where they end up. Marriage guidance, I ask you.
Was it a long time before you were aware that that book had become, I don’t know, a bit of a cult book. Had made the impact amongst people who admired it. Not amongst people who’d detracted but amongst people who loved it. Did that take a long time to happen?
Doris Lessing: Yes, it took a bit of time. The thing is that it was, it was a cult book among the feminists which did me a lot of harm. Which had meant that as I’ve had letters from men, we didn’t read it because it was supposed to be a feminist book. And now it’s … yes I had that letter several times. So it didn’t do me any good the feminists. They never quite, they were very extreme the feminists of that time. I remember going to Sweden and some actress coming up to me and saying: This is my book, it is not your book. It is not yours. I only read the Blue Notebook. So this kind of exaggerated hysterical rubbish was going on.
Did it sort of, thinking just formerly what you’d done there. Did that give you a feeling that you were now free to experiment in other ways with how you made a novel or the kind of the genres of novel that you wrote?
Doris Lessing: Well, I was writing a lot of books that were not realistic, you know. The Memoirs of a Survivor and Briefing for a Descent into Hell. Those are my two non-realistic books before I got round to Shikasta. That was five books which I think are some of the best writing I’ve ever done. I know a lot of people did.
Your Canopus in Argos?
Doris Lessing: Yes.
Yes.
Doris Lessing: So. You know, I’d already been doing all that before the Shikasta series. Which incidentally, each book is quite different from every other. It isn’t a series at all really. So … and then I wrote, I was just going on all the time. You see, I’ve never done anything else in my life. I didn’t ever have a vivid social life because I had a child. You can’t go dancing every night when you’ve got a child.";918;Role of literature
But people, I think, are thinking perhaps of the science fiction books. People sometimes think describe you as quite a sort of contrarian writer that as soon as you’ve established one way of doing things and you’ve got fans for that, you then go off and try something completely different and risk leaving all those admirers in your wake.;"Well. You don’t leave. I mean things have changed now. The novel as you know is not everybody’s favourite cup of tea if I can put it like that. But I can remember being in San Francisco and somebody, a man stands up and says: Now Doris, I hope you’re not going to waste any more time on that boring old realism. And up bounces a woman and says: Now Doris, I hope you’re not going to write any of that awful science fiction. Then they get into an argument and the entire audience gets into an argument and I just listen. This wouldn’t happen now because nobody cares about. That’s the trouble. I mean, a novel is not where the passion is situated, is it? So I don’t think we’d have that now.
Can you tell us a bit more about why you found it so useful to you or so expressive for your purposes to write science fiction, why you wanted to do that.
But I didn’t think now I’m going to write Sci Fi. I just wrote it as it came along.
Doris Lessing: I just did it because I wanted to write a book because somebody, not of this culture, said that nobody ever read the Old Testament, that is the Jewish books, the Apocrypha, the New Testament and the Koran, one after another. Nobody did. He said if anyone did that they would see that this is phases of the same religion, it’s perfectly obvious. So I did this and I thought: My god, of course it’s phases of the same religion. So then I was inspired to write Shikasta. But I didn’t think now I’m going to write Sci Fi. I just wrote it as it came along. And another book that I’d been wanting to write for a long time, that’s The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five. I had been thinking about it for 10 years. I couldn’t get it to gel. Suddenly, it just gelled.
There was something about writing that series that was enormously productive for me. I was suddenly able to write that book and then I wrote The Sirian Experiments which I think is one my very best. But however very few people ever read it. And so on. And then that was an end. And I’ve forgotten why it came to an end. It was some kind of legal something. I’ve forgotten what it was. And yes, you get all these things happening you forget. This was quite a dramatic thing that somebody or something signed up that series to go somewhere and I can’t remember where, and I can’t remember now even where it was going. But I stopped writing it. Which was a pity really. But it doesn’t matter, I wrote other books.";918;Creativity
I just wanted to ask you actually after the Canopus in Argos books, you published what I suppose I’ve always taken as being a bit of a sort of rejoinder to the people who perhaps complained, critics who complained that you weren’t doing realism anymore because you publish The Diary of a Good Neighbour under a pseudonym, Jane Somers, didn’t you? I wonder if you could tell us about that little strategy?;"Well, you get very bored if you’re in a … often it’s exactly the same thing as a previous review and so on. So I thought I’d write something like this and see what happened. And I knew perfectly well what would happen. Because this book went to my two main publishers at that time. And then neither of them wanted it. And I saw a couple of readers reports which were extremely iffy. But Michael Joseph, my first publisher took it. And so we swore her to secrecy. Now what was interesting is that two major publishing houses, with all these people working for them were able to keep quiet about the fact that I’d written.
That is incredible, yes.
Doris Lessing: Enormously impressed by that. Then it came out and I got the kind of reviews that a promising first book gets. But one interesting thing was, somebody wrote from America to say that the New York Times had commissioned a review which said that this was a wonderful book and they didn’t publish it. Now if in fact they had published it, that book would have done very well. Much better than just a promising first book. So it’s all very chancy all this you know. The whole thing. So then, nobody guessed who I was which I thought was quite extraordinary. Now the French and Germans published it not knowing it was me and they did quite … I was very pleased about that.
Wasn’t there something on the dust jacket, because I think I’ve seen a first edition of it and there’s something on the dust jacket which indicates that Jane Somers isn’t the real name of the author. I think it says something like the author is a well known London journalist or something.
Doris Lessing: Is that on the continent?
I think that’s on … Is that not on the British edition? I think it is.
Doris Lessing: I don’t know, I haven’t seen it.
That there’s some clue that it’s a pseudonym which would sort of, you know …
Doris Lessing: Well, I can’t remember now.
And I mean it’s a wonderful bleak, it’s a bleak book. I mean it’s almost if you want realism here is some very stringent realism indeed because it’s all about …
Doris Lessing: Old age.
Old age. Unblinkingly so.
Doris Lessing: For some reason I can’t remember now, I was involved with a group of old people not far away. There were three old women and an old man. And it went on for, what, seven or eight years, these people. But the one I really liked was Maudy who was a very angry old woman, well she was a very angry woman.
So the character’s based on a real …
Doris Lessing: Yes, she is. And then you see it ended in us. I can’t remember if it’s in the book or not. She died of cancer.
Yes, that’s in the book.
Doris Lessing: And I was very fond of her. But they all died, you see. They were as old as I am now. So they died, they have to die. And it was enormously instructive because there was a house not far from here where there was a good church going woman, Sarah, who did everything right like going to church meetings and parties and bus rides and all that. And the other bad one who had decided she couldn’t move from her chair, which was rubbish, and she got everyone running around after her. And she was a thoroughly bad lot. She really was a wicked old woman. But another interesting thing that happened was that you were watching the services, the complaint was that old people were living on the smell of an oil rag, how wicked. In actual fact, they had so much money, they couldn’t spend it. Because their rents were paid and their food was paid and everything was paid all the time.
And what actually happened was the weekly packet would stack up in drawers everywhere and it was quietly lifted by every social worker that came and, well, they needed money for their kids. So this is what actually happened, not as one likes to say it should happen. And some very high place social worker would come in and you’d see this rather thoughtful look come over her face. I’ll just nick out a couple of twenties. Into the bag, off you go.
I hadn’t realised that that novel was also based on sort of things that you’d observed for yourself.
Doris Lessing: Oh yes, it was, it was very, there was a lot of that.";918;Creativity
What about then after that, there’s a novel that you published in 1985 which I confess is a favourite one of mine which I read soon after it was first published, The Good Terrorist, which seems in a way, although it’s about its own times, it seems also to take you back a bit to that territory of these sort of groups of self righteous so called idealists or political idealists.;"Well, that was very much based. People have forgotten that everywhere, America, Europe, everywhere. There were these groups of so called revolutionaries, you know, we are revolutionaries. And they would be in a house somewhere, and I had very interesting letters about that. The most interesting being coming from Ireland saying did I realise that it was enough for these young people, if they wore the right uniform and used the right jargon to live quite happily for years, never go so much as to a political meeting? But they were revolutionaries. Now that era has absolutely gone with the death of the Soviet Union. That came to an end. But there were a lot of them you know. You met them all around the place.
They might be revolutionaries, but money, this is what they talked about.
And so that one was based on partly remembering what it was like being a member of a communist group when, you know, come the revolution, which was always said half laughing, which is very funny when I look back. And next door to me at that particular time, just down, across the road was a house stuffed full of squatters and revolutionaries. So I saw them quite a lot. But what was really interesting about this was they never stopped talking about money. They might be revolutionaries, but money, this is what they talked about. How to get the next payment from somewhere. So that was really hilarious.";918;Creativity
And in the 1990s, I mean you were writing these novels and more that we haven’t talked about. In the 1990s, you wrote a couple of volumes of autobiography as well which I think some people like as much as your novels. But you stopped in 1962 with those. I mean they only take your life to 1962. Why did you decide?;"Well, it’s very simple. In 1960, I was one of these earth mothers. And the house was full of kids and trouble in one way or another. And in it at that time, I don’t know if you noticed it. There were these women with housefuls of kids. Why did that happen? I don’t know why it did. But the point is that all these kids are now grown up and are close friends and I couldn’t possibly write about them. I just couldn’t do it. So I wrote The Sweetest Dream but I didn’t use the people but I used, I hope, the atmosphere of the 60s. And that started off because I was in Germany being interviewed. And this young man wanted to know about the 60s. And he’s talking with such contempt. I said: Whatever else, it had this most wonderful generosity. And I said: Imagine, a young man will just turn up somewhere and say my name is Bert and I’m a friend of Freddy’s. Can I come in? Oh, do come in, and they might be there for a month. He said: You can’t just let anybody into your house just like that. You can’t do that. He might be a thief. And I said: But maybe he was a thief, but this is what we did. And I thought my god, everyone has forgotten it.
And it was in fact a wonderfully generous time because it was going on everywhere. I’ve got letters somewhere from other earth mothers and sort of. The one that I like best was someone in Mississippi or somewhere saying: I understand that you’ve had Tom there. Don’t you think we should do something about his teeth. Wonderful. Anyway, I can’t remember about his teeth. We probably did do something about his teeth.
So there’s sort of affection as well as ridicule when you look back to …
Doris Lessing: I don’t ridicule. It was a wonderfully …  Well, no-one now can just go round the world on a half a sentence: You know, I’m Freddy and I know Janet. I mean it was wonderful wasn’t it?
Well, I don’t know, I didn’t really live through it I suppose.
Doris Lessing: No, well I think it was terrific. No-one could do it now because you’re too suspicious.";918;Motivation
Yes. And you were writing also, I don’t know if this is a fair way of describing that some of your books from the late 80s and the 1990s they seem sort of just like Shakespeare wrote problem plays, I think you wrote some problem novels. So there’s The Fifth Child for instance, about a couple who think they’re going to have this kind of wonderful blissful family life and they have a sort of malevolent child. Or there’s Love, Again about a woman in the1990s, about a woman who thinks all the sort of tumult of passion is perhaps with relief passed and then she falls in love again. I mean is that a … to think of them as problem.;"I’ve never thought of it as problem novels. The Fifth Child. It was simply because I wanted to write a version of the fairy leaving a baby in a human cradle. Because, you know, it’s an ancient story in practically every culture, which makes you wonder if in fact babies have been left in cradles and we’ve forgotten that time. Because I maintain there were little people. They’ve just found some over in Sumatra somewhere called the Flores, have you read about them?
No, I haven’t, no.
Doris Lessing: They found a race of people who are humans but smaller. And some of the scientists say no, this is totally impossible, this is just an aberrant human. Couldn’t be, but other scientists say no, these were human beings, they were just smaller. And I always thought this always. Where did our tales come from about the little people. It was based on something. So I think there were little people. And so we called them fairies or trolls or whatever. But I’m sure they were here. Why does every second garden have gnomes in it? What are we remembering? We’re remembering something. It’s half out of memory.";918;Creativity
And you’ve done fantasy although I don’t know if fantasy’s the right word for it but quite recently, I mean only a year ago, you published The Cleft which is … is fantasy the right word for it, it’s an extraordinary kind of imaginative projection of a sort of primitive tale in which the female sex pre-existed the male sex and then …;"Well, it was in the papers of that time. You know how there’s an idea and it’s around and it disappears. The idea was that the basic human stock was female and then men came along later. The more you think about this, the more it explains. Because as you know, all women say men are just nothing but children.
Yes.
Doris Lessing: I mean nearly always. So I thought it made a lot of sense if we had women on their seashore, you know because it was a very nice climate, they just ate fish, they never had anything to startle them out of their boring life. And suddenly men arrived. You know, men always rushing after Eiger and going around the world on small boats. Must have been very like Top Gear suddenly arrived.
Yes.
Doris Lessing: Must have been awful for the poor girls.
I wonder if our international viewers will know what Top Gear is, but …
Doris Lessing: I don’t know. Well it’s a very, it’s one of the funniest programmes on television.
Inadvertently though isn’t it?
Doris Lessing: I know it’s so hilarious. It’s about motoring.
About men in cars, yes.
Doris Lessing: And I swear that all women must look at that just marvelling. There you have these men, absorbed in these horrible cars. I’ve laughed so much over that programme. Anyway, just imagine the girls who’ve never ever been upset by anything. Not only do they have little boys with penises. Because I’m going back to memory when I had my first child. There was a woman in the same room who was having her third child. She’d had two girls and this was a boy. I was having my first. And she was in a state of absolute incandescent. She says to the nurse: What’s this? Meaning that little boys apparatus. So the nurse said: Oh Mrs Johnson, aren’t you lucky, you’ve got such a dear little boy. Take it away, I’m not taking that home. So I said to her: What’s the matter with you, you know there’s my boy. She says: I’m not going to take that. I mean look at it. Isn’t that horrible. Because you probably know because you’ve got children that little boys have a lot of physical apparatus. Then it goes into … it sort of comes right in about a week or two. But it’s quite a surprise seeing a newborn baby. They’re all genitals. Well, just imagine these poor girls suddenly faced with this. So it’s quite a funny idea actually.
I mean, since then you’ve written another book actually, Alfred & Emily, you’re still writing. I mean that’s a book which I think uses, I mean explores in a certain way the lives of your parents, is that right? I wonder if you could tell us a bit about that.
Doris Lessing: Well, the reason for that is. For no reason I can see the wars in my life sit on me more and more as a kind of horror. I still can’t believe that we’re so stupid as to. Anyway, it’s no good going into it. Either you feel that way or you don’t. I’m so appalled by those wars. I mean the First World War by god, it did Europe in. We’re still living in the aftermath.
And that book’s about … isn’t that book about the aftermath?
Doris Lessing: Yes, I’ve simply taken my parents and abolished World War I. And if I might remind you, no World War I, no Russian Revolution, no Soviet Union, no Soviet Empire, no Hitler, no Holocaust, no World War II. It all came from World War I. And I’ve given them rather ordinary lives. Sort of decent, sensible lives. Particularly my mother, who has some money and can use it, which she should have done. And made my father a farmer, because he longed all his life to be an English farmer in Essex or Suffolk where his forbears came from. So I gave him that and I gave him a nice loving wife instead of a rather prickly one. And then I have the second half of the book which is what actually happened which I think is a heartbreaker. Because  that’s my father’s life as it happened. You know, he got diabetes, he got all the things that you get as an effect of diabetes.
So the book has the imagined life and the real life sort of interleafed.
Doris Lessing: So I think it’s an anti war book. It’s a war violently against … It’s a book against war. Which I felt all my life and I just feel it more and more. And things like Iraq. I mean I don’t have to go into that. There’s so many people appalled by it.
So you’re still sort of feeling driven to write things?
Doris Lessing: Yes. Well, I don’t think so anymore. I think I’ve had it. I don’t have any energy.
Well, I don’t, I’m not sure I believe.
Doris Lessing: The energy’s gone.
I’m not sure I believe it.
Doris Lessing: Well, that’s alright, I haven’t got it.";918;Family/Home Environment
My name is Horace Engdahl, I am the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish academy, and here beside me is Mr Orhan Pamuk, the literary Nobel Laureate of the year 2007. [Editor’s correction: Pamuk was awarded the 2006 prize.] Welcome. First question I would like to ask you to describe the circumstances around your first book? How you came to write it and what kind of writer you thought you were going to be when you wrote it.;"As I narrated in my book Istanbul, which is half an autobiography, half an essay about the town, I wanted to be a painter between the ages of 7 and 22, and with mysterious reason which I cannot explain with one single sentence, but which it took me so perhaps answer the whole Istanbul book to explain, I quit the drawing or painting or in fact my desire to be a painter and immediately started writing my first book Cevdet Bey and His Sons. I had an idea about the book, but more so I’d been reading fiction, seriously fiction, for the last eight years, seven years, and I had a deep understanding or some sort of understanding of what I wanted to do in literature, that I wanted to write a 19th century novel, a sort of family chronicle …
Like Buddenbrooks?
Orhan Pamuk: Buddenbrooks or like The Forsyte Saga, chronicling the adventures of a Turkish upper middle class rich family with the emergence of the new Turkish ruling elites. And yes, Buddenbrooks was a heavy influence on that book and I started to make myself a sort of a 19th century old fashioned realist. I have still some readers in Turkey who tell me that Well, this is your best book, Mr Pamuk, with these other experimental novels you have lost whatever I had in that book, which I sometimes naively listen and say I may even have one or two seconds of regret, maybe I should have continued in that line.
I have no opinion on that, but please continue.
Then there was a military coup and I realised that I cannot publish that book …
Orhan Pamuk: Then after a while it took for me four years between early 23 and 26 to finish that book, it took another three years, in fact four years, to publish that book, but in between time there was a military coup in Turkey, and right after finishing that I gave that manuscript to a competition for unpublished manuscripts which I won, but then publication at that time was hard.
Then I began writing my second novel, which was in fact a political novel, but like Snow a political novel written not for propaganda but to explore the youthful and a sort of anarchic enthusiasm my generation of upper middle class Istanbul, secular boys were enjoying with the heavy influence of Marxism at that time.  Then there was a military coup and I realised that  I cannot publish that book, I switched, I began writing a third book which is my published second book which is The Silent House, and then finally in 1982, I managed to get published this first book, 600 pages of family chronicle also narrating the coming into being of the Turkish upper middle classes, the invention of the Turkish identity, in fact the making of the …
You’re referring to The Silent House?
Orhan Pamuk: No. I’m referring to the first book. Once I published that, that was successful, I got national prizes. Then I continued with The Silent House, after which, and that was also successful, I began to find my voice. These two books, the first one was typically 19th century realism and the second one was also influenced by Faulkner kind of point of view …
Point of view …
Orhan Pamuk: … points of view which I experimented more radically in My Name Is Red. The third book was a strange book which took its final shape with coincidences is The White Castle, it’s the story of a 16th century Ottoman scholar who buys Italian slaves, so to speak, and then sort of dramatical interchange of the spirits of these people, sort of an east west novel in which I began to experiment a little and also went to places when I was writing the book that I was not sure about.
Yes, and that book won you international fame.
Orhan Pamuk: The White Castle was published in 1985 and there, at that time, when it was published, I was in the United States, the Columbia University in New York, a sort of, as I sometimes jokingly tell, my being my wife’s husband because I was the spouse and she was taking her PhD. Columbia University was kind to me and I was also teaching and giving native Turkish courses while, on the other hand, I had a little room at the library in which I wrote more than half of The Black Book, and it’s very typical of the non-resident person coming through main cultural centres of western civilisation, say London, Paris, New York, and then having a sort of an anxiety about his cultural identity and I lived these things when I was … and I faced the immense richness of American libraries and culture.
… there at the age of 32 I begin to read old Sufi allegorism …
Then I begin to ask myself what is Turkish culture? What am I doing there? And at that time I used to think that Turkey’s cultural roles, identity, should only be a sort of an ultra-Occidentalism, there at the age of 32 I begin to read old Sufi allegorism, the whole classic texts of classic texts of Islamic mysticism, most of them are classical Persian texts, with an eye on Borges and Calvino whom they have taught me to look at literary texts as not as a sort of a structures which has metaphysical qualities, I have learned from Borges and Calvino to delete the very heavy religious way of classical Islamic text and try and see these texts as sort of geometrical shapes and metaphysical structures and allegories …
Parables.
Orhan Pamuk: Parables full of literary games …
And paradox of course.
Orhan Pamuk: Yes. And then after the heavy influence of 19th century novel, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Proust and Nabokov and Faulkner, Borges and Calvino opened a way to look at, a secular way of looking at classic Islamic heritage.
Yes, I mean it’s amazing the richness of the oriental material that you bring into especially The Black Book, I mean It’s overwhelming for a western reader, and one starts to ask oneself questions like in which languages have you read all these …
Orhan Pamuk: Oh, most of them I have read ironically enough, of course in Turkish, and in English and I’m heavily indebted to a Turkish translation of /- – -/ which was very well translated to Turkish, but /- – -/ translation even the /- – -/ edition was a sort of an inspiring encyclopaedia of medieval Islamic culture with all its glory, with all its rhetoric and literary games that I was now my desire to say to the rest of the world, to the western, great western writers, you know, there is also some literary material here. I think that all the questions of literary heritage, identity, most of the time are answered by these people who are heavily influenced by the international style, international avant garde so to speak.
It’s true that more than once when you read The White Castle and The Black Book you think of Calvino for instance, Le città invisibili, Invisible Cities which I suppose you must have liked, but still there’s a lot of it that is very unexpected to the western reader and it has to do of course with the Sufi tradition and also where the writing’s are roomy, especially.
Orhan Pamuk: There is also an influence of Arabian Nights or as the Turks call it One Thousand and One Nights, I think that book, although the details, some of the stories, are oriental, actually a western invention, a sort of an … it’s found by the western compilers who had put together books, some of the books, some of the most famous stories are not even … we doubt that now, are not even original, but that book as a sort of a book which comes from, heavily from Indian tradition going through Arabic and Persian influences, and then as a sort of a text, an ocean of stories, which was given a shape and an understanding and elevated to a higher stature by the French and English, Orientalist was also behind The Black Book, the idea of constantly telling stories, the idea of a person who is in deep trouble but who cannot face that his trouble, problems, who instead of addressing the question gives you another story, is a heavy influence but with a light touch from Arabian Nights.
Yes, but in The Black Book you seem to move from story to story through tales and parables endlessly and there is no end, there is no bottom, and there is no origin either.
Orhan Pamuk: There’s no?
Origin.
Orhan Pamuk: I thought that the formula or the structure of The Black Book, the idea was to put together whatever you find interesting about Istanbul, its old book shops, its stories, Its mysteries, the chemistry of its streets, and what I have lived and loved when I lived there all my life, remembering your childhood and try to see the city as a sort of a place where layers of layers, things and images, history and myth combined, and combine this with experimental post modern European avant gardism, all together with a classical Sufi text and see what happens. I strongly believe that creativity in literature comes from first an understanding that you have to put together two things that have never been put together and see if there is an electricity in between them, of course for here the author, the narrator wants to be the source of that electricity.
Someone makes that remark in My Name Is Red, that there’s great innovations in painting often come from two different traditions being brought together at a specific point. So I suppose you can use this in writing as well as in painting.
… the beginnings of good art or different art is a Dadaist idea.
Orhan Pamuk: I think Dadaists are so important in literature although that at first they were the source for surrealists, but the idea of bringing things that we at first think that are impossible to bring together or almost daring and scandalous to combine, in fact Dadaist taught us that the art can be putting first an attempt to put together things that never came together, the beginnings of good art or different art is a Dadaist idea.";919;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
In The Black Book there’s also for a western reader this magic of the fluent identities that sometimes even borders on Metempsychosis and is this something that came to you during the writing? Because you have the element of course in The White Castle, but it’s so much more poetic in The Black Book.;"I like the idea, maybe personal, but that the boundary of human personality is not strong, my understanding of human nature is not Freudian, but I think that there are no essences of, there are no characters or essences that make us constantly. I believe that we constantly change, and these are dear ideas which in my novels perhaps I combine with my countries, Turkey’s history that of, you know, having two souls, two spirits, that of believing in nature and harmony with TUSTUS science, while on the other hand keeping an eye on the fact that there is almost always a dramatical tension with two sides of our personality. We have to address these issues, we have to see these hidden depths or hidden characters in us, but on the other hand believe that we have to search for these dark places deep inside us, rather than thinking flatly that they will not come together, that east and west will not come together, that harmony between peoples or cultures are impossible, these are ideas I do not believe in.
No but there’s also this fascinating thing in The Black Book that makes for a lot of the tensions that are … whenever someone tells a story he or she is gradually transformed into the object of that story, and when you make love you imitate someone else making love, when you start to write you imagine yourself to be the writer you’re going to be as in the extreme case of the main character becoming his relative Celal or whatever, and this is, you know, to me there is a great western French philosopher and literary scholar who’s been working in the United States for most of his life, René Girard, I don’t know If you’re familiar with his work?
Orhan Pamuk: Yes, of course.
And his theory of mimetical desire and it fits very well with your …
Orhan Pamuk: I understand, I am an admirer of René Girard’s work but I have come across him later in years, The Scapegoat, Sacrifice, I like these subjects, but on the other hand it was a rather simplistic or simple idea that I think that even in the worst conditions that to be able to tell a story is a sort of a great relief for me, that I believe that in fact if there are Hegelian minds who are trying to over- rule each other which is a Hegelian point of view of history, I think that my understanding of people’s wills or minds clashing is who is going to tell who’s story earlier? Who is going to impose his or her story? It think all of my characters in various books be it My Name is Red, be it The Black Book or even Snow, the one who manages to tell his story, pass his story, survives or telling stories is a way of surviving and continuing to live.";919;Creativity
Yes, this is true, I mean there is this rivalry for instance in Snow between the poet Ka and Blue, the religious leader, they are struggling for the same woman, for the same women, and God knows who comes out victorious because you leave lots of things open in that novel. And it comes to a moment towards the end of the book which I find particularly fascinating when Ka is actually betraying Blue to the security forces and he’s killed, and why does he do that? We’re never told, but there’s one hypothesis that’s put forward is that Ka suddenly came to realise that he is not as he had believed, the sublime poet, he’s the poet clerk and it’s the other one who is so to say chosen by the gods. I find that particularly arresting I must say and it brings to mind something that i personally feel to be one of your sort of … one of the keys to your work, now I’m advancing a very, daring hypothesis, but I have to do it, namely that jealousy is one of your main things.;"I agree, that this begins from … it was strong even in my early book Cevdet Bey and his Sons, that was jealousy between brothers, then there is, it is still there in The Silent House, obviously there a sort of a not jealousy but a sort of this time Hegelian master and slave form in The White Castle and it continues that presence of a person who may be more wiser, more intelligent, more cunning and who goes to a place that is, and enjoys a life which is richer and deeper than us is another theme that I like and it’s also related to jealousy, and I continue to have that theme all my life including in my autobiographical Istanbul book in which I mention about a sort of rivalry with my brother.
Yes, yes. And I think in My Name is Red it’s very obvious, this force …
Orhan Pamuk: Yes, it’s who …
The emotional basis of the whole novel.
Orhan Pamuk: Is that who is the best artist is an idea that is hovering around and makes all the artists more jealous and in fact leads to the murder of …
It leads to violence.
Orhan Pamuk: Yes.";919;Creativity
That’s interesting. If I may come to address the question of your role as a writer, you’ve been saying something in interviews that I have read about how much you value isolation, that what really makes you write is that you can retire into a room where you’re absolutely alone and even bored, and when nothing happens and you can sit hour after hour and the only thing that will ever happen there is that you start to write. This of course brings to mind the famous passage in one of Montaigne’s essays where he talks about his “arrière boutique”, the secret to how you always have to keep behind the shop where you never let anybody into and where things like your wife, your children, your father, your mother, your country doesn’t exist for you any more, where you’re absolutely alone.;"Montaigne invented first for the western, French and western civilisation the idea of a solitary person who reads books on his own, passes judgement on his own, who believes his idea and his reasoning and then has a deep conviction of brotherhood of humanity, of all the persons in the world because we share the same mind, and he I think paved the way for not only the enlightenment and glorification or proliferation of western thoughts but this idea which I cherish, that of the solitary person who not necessarily political, but who at the back of his room reads, writes and produces something that had never been thought before entirely, that is the beginnings of perhaps the uniqueness, the cult of personality in western civilisation, the uniqueness of the character and the consequence of these thoughts are style, style in literature so forth, and …
And also this particular structure that you touch upon that is the relationship between the implicit writer and the implicit reader.
Orhan Pamuk: I see.
Because that really doesn’t exist before Montaigne in my view.
Orhan Pamuk: Yes I agree.
It’s a result of this.
… he explores perhaps first the inner depths of his soul …
Orhan Pamuk: So my idea of a writer is not a person, a social person, a person who expresses himself in society or in a community but a person who for this or that reason, tragically or self, with joy, who leaves the community, the society, the group, the tribe, the nation or that he or she belongs, and first it’s some sort of an instinct that he doesn’t want to understand, goes to a room and writes there. There he explores perhaps first the inner depths of his soul but then comes out with something new which will address to all humanity because the essential idea being that we are all, we have the same kind of minds.
Yes. Yes. I mean probably the possibility of being alone between four walls is the greatest leap forward in the history of civilisation …
Orhan Pamuk: Hoping this belief that in your loneliness you’re writing something but then there is a secret or unexpressed belief that it will address the hearts of the other readers, that is a strong belief in humanity.
Yes, I think you can see in Montaigne, you have this idea /- – -/ when he has a friend, you know, de La Boetie, and …
Orhan Pamuk: He wrote very well about friendship.
Yes, when the friend dies he has to find someone else and that is eventually the reader.
Orhan Pamuk: I see, I agree yes.
That’s how it happens, and this has to be an anonymous reader, it’s very important, because earlier everybody writes for people they know, they have an addressee that is known that is socially close so to speak, but from this moment on it’s anybody.
Orhan Pamuk: Yes, and modernity was invented with this idea that we are not, yes, we are not writing for one particular person, but then we’re addressing a sort of an other non-existent in a room, but with a non-existent readership.
And the book is calling forth someone who would be this person, able to understand.
Orhan Pamuk: I have all my life played around with the idea of the reader looking over my text over my shoulder, sometimes talking with them, which upset my readers sometimes, sometimes openly addressing them, sometimes playing around with their expectation, sometimes pulling the reader into the story, sometimes also introducing myself or a person who is very like me as also, figures who talk with the reader …
You use your own name.
Orhan Pamuk: Yes, I use them, then obviously they are characters who are very close to me, maybe someone, a fictional realistic portrait of me.
But not quite you yet.
Orhan Pamuk: Yes, yes. We have to be elusive to continue in this art of fiction, we should never give up everything, but we should continue to give up something from the inner depths of our spirit, from our heart. I believe the power of fiction comes from also, not only from that, but of course also from frankness, from honesty, from telling the truth which your friends suspect that you will never tell, be not politically but spiritually brave and believe that at one part, a student, a person like you, a person who maybe 30 years, 40 years younger but who may experience the same thing either in your country or in another corner of the world, will share the sentiments, these little details that you would think that’s only personal and should be neglected, will address the hearts of every reader.";919;Creativity
Yes, on the other hand one has to ask oneself at some point whether this possibility of sharing is universal, I mean you deny the clash of civilisation, right, and of course what you show in your writing is how things go around and return from unexpected directions and things that you believed to be foreign are actually very close to yourself, and vice versa. On the other hand I as a western reader, a Nordic reader, have to ask myself if there is something in your books that you believe is difficult for a northerner or a westerner to understand. Let me point to one rather peculiar detail in one of your books, in Istanbul, when you speak about some famous travel logs written by French poets in the 19th century, Gérard de Nerval, Voyage en Orient. I’ve read that book, it’s a marvellous book, I mean it’s a marvellous description of what he calls Constantinople, at the beginning of his visit to Constantinople he gets out to look at the Sultan, you know, and you have picked this up, and the Sultan is leaving his carriage and Nerval believes that he meets the eye of the Sultan, do you remember that?;"Yes.
And he feels such pity for the Sultan and it’s almost a spontaneous brotherhood that emerges between these two men in a matter of seconds, you know, when he thinks through what must be this man’s existence with his slave women and all that sort of thing, but you deny the possibility of Nerval catching the Sultan’s eye and I must ask myself why, and is that not a way of telling us that …
Orhan Pamuk: I think that …
… no you don’t quite understand.
Orhan Pamuk: … the detail that comes across other travel books as well, that everyone go to this Friday the Sultan is going around and you can see him only on Fridays, and they’ll go there and they’ll say “oh we came eye to eye and we had a little sort of a spiritual one moment understanding” which I thought was a …
So it’s sort of a cliché …
Orhan Pamuk: I thought it was a bit of a cliché, and then of course there were most of these in mid 19th century French visitors are writing for the newspapers, for your /- – -/ now, and then you have to be, you know, it’s like “a reporter came face to face with the Sultan and they had a moment of understanding” which is good, yes, which is good, but also on the other hand there is this very western idea that, not Muslim or Eastern, that you come an eye to an eye and then, in those days he has also passages like that, then our story teller meets a reporter or a novelist or a Gérard de Nerval or a traveller, begins to put himself in the shoes of this other person …
That’s exactly what it is.
… that it’s very interesting to understand the other.
Orhan Pamuk: … which is a great invention, which is the beginnings of the art of the novel. I strongly believe that what makes the art of the novel continue with all its glory is that it is about compassion, understanding others, people who are not like us, it is about the human beings desire to put itself, himself, herself in the place of the other that’s strange, even as strange as the Ottoman Sultan, and he wants to understand this person, that is the beginning of putting a frame into the world and thinking that we can understand each other, that it’s very interesting to understand the other. We read novels thinking that here is a representation of an other, say a man is writing about a woman, Gérard de Nerval is writing about the Ottoman Sultan, very different entities, but we enjoy a novel not believing that here is a woman speaking, we enjoy a novel here is Tolstoy imagining a woman, adulterous woman and we know that this is … we also know that we never lose that this is written by a man who is not in the same shoes, but the interesting thing as we read a novel and we …
We will …
Orhan Pamuk: … we think that Flaubert is doing his best to identify with Madame Bovary, and then we follow the novel both … It’s not a one to one representation of a woman but a man’s attempt to understand the other.
So if we judge Nerval as a reporter we must say he was wrong, but if we look at him as a writer he was right.
Orhan Pamuk: As a reporter he was using the regular clichés, but as an artist he was developing, he has such a nature of inborn storyteller, injects the story and injects a situation.
Because it is a very good story.
Orhan Pamuk: He had, he managed to identify with the Sultan like that.
Well, I have no further questions as they say in the courts.
Orhan Pamuk: Thank you, it was a pleasant conversation.";919;creativity
Why did you become a writer? Who inspired you?;As is said about most writers: on the one hand all I ever did from when I was a child was read, and I was a loner, which was furthered by my parents and my upbringing. On the other hand, the more I read, the more I felt this well-known fissure between me and the world. That started very early on, and then I guess I tried to close up this fissure with something that was accessible to me, and all I had was writing. My inspiration came especially in the 1950s through the Vienna Group founded by writer H.C. Artmann. It showed me that if you want to say something, you have to let the language itself say it, because language is usually more meaningful than the mere content that one wishes to convey. My training in music and composition then led me to a kind of musical language process in which, for example, the sound of the words I play with has to expose their true meaning against their will so to speak.;921;Motivation
Some time has now passed since the announcement that you have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2004. Do you think this will affect your future writing?;I have the feeling it will influence my future writing to the extent that without any material worries I could develop a greater ease, even lightheartedness, in my writing. That might be good for my language process, which as I said tends to be compositional. It could draw from a greater reservoir of freedom. The irony could develop an even greater ease.;921;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What role has Internet had for you as a writer?;Internet is exemplary for me. I do not want to have the feeling of writing “for eternity,” so to speak. The fleetingness of the Internet has therefore become very attractive to me. At some point I set up a heading on my homepage called “Notizen,” or “Notes,” in which I try to capture the fleetingness of jotting things down, similar to emails, which on the one hand acknowledges current events but on the other hand is not carved in stone. Instead it is more like something you write in wet sand with your finger. You can remove it at any time, whereas a book is more an object that “remains,” as it were, something you hold in your hand.;921;Career Development
In your opinion what is the most pressing social issue in Western society today?;"That is very difficult to answer. I think isolation is one of the greatest problems, an ever-growing obstacle to political solidarity. In the past we would’ve said: to the development of class consciousness. The petty-bourgeoisification of society, with its hopes of climbing socially and its apprehension that a fall could come at any moment (there are no “jobs for life” anymore; everyone is at risk; jobs are becoming increasingly insecure; each individual’s survival is becoming more and more precarious, yet this doesn’t seem to lead to greater solidarity with others in a similar situation) – this all seems very dangerous to me. Eroding solidarity paradoxically makes a society more susceptible to the construction of substitute collectives and fascisms of all kinds.";921;Future research
As a Nobel Laureate you will have the opportunity to nominate for the Nobel Literature Prize in the future. What kind of literature would you like to see awarded a Nobel Prize?;Literature that keeps employing new linguistic and formal modes of expression to draft a panorama of society as a whole while at the same time exposing it, tearing the masks from its face – for me that would be deserving of an award.;921;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
Nobel Laureate in Literature of the year 2001. Sir Vidia, if you try to think back to your beginnings as a writer, when you were a young man, and hadn’t yet published anything, what was your idea of the kind of writer you wanted to begin with being? What kind of literature did you want to produce? Into what tradition, if I may say so, did you wish to insert yourself in those days?;"Actually it was, it couldn’t be that kind of question that one had to answer. One’s wish was to learn to write. You know, I could write school essays, I could do university writing, but to become a writer was another matter. The writing had to have another kind of internal life and spring and tension, so I had to learn. And the great, great problem for me, just beginning, was to find out what kind of person I was. Now, this is not pretentious. I began when I was about 17, much influenced by Evelyn Waugh, I began writing a farce, set in Trinidad, and I worked at that for two years. Now, nothing happened to that. I was heartbroken, but not disappointed. The value of that to me was that I learned how to take a book to the end. I learned distance in writing. But the farce was not suited to me.
Still, if I may interrupt you, in the short stories of Miguel Street, there seems to be farcical elements in your writing.
I spent a long time working at something much more serious, much more sombre.
V. S. Naipaul: When I became secure, when I became secure, because after that farcical Evelyn Waugh-like book, I spent a long time working at something much more serious, much more sombre. And I sent that to … I was doing a BBC programme, editing it, once a week, and a literary person came to do something on the programme, and I asked him to look, look at what I was doing, and he replied very promptly, saying please abandon this. This was a serious book.
So, out of these two rejections the farce and then this very sombre later book, these two failures, I arrived one day in my mind quite miraculously at this other tone in Miguel Street, which you just mentioned. And I’ve thought about the origin of that, and I believe it has a base in Spanish picaresque writing. I believe it derives from Lazarillo de Tormes, one aspect, one aspect. That was a book I studied in the sixth form before going to Oxford, and when I was in Oxford, and out of this wish to be a writer, not knowing what to write about, one of the things I did was to translate the Lazarillo for my own benefit. I sent it to the editor of the Penguin Classics and, oh no, I asked him whether he’d like me to translate it and he didn’t think it was a classic. So nothing happened to that, but it was with me for a long time, and I think the tone was still with me. I can still, as it were, give you the rhythm and the language of the Lazarillo. Well, first of all, you must know that my name is so-and-so, and I was the son of so-and-so, and I was born on the River Tormes, it came about in this way. So I know the rhythm of that kind of thing. Yes, so that’s where it began really.";924;Mentor(Role Models)
And once you arrive at A House for Mr Biswas things are very different in your writing. Why was that?;"It was a great … this early writing, which was full of jokes, and it … those jokes were a form of hysteria, and the hysteria had to do with my own uncertainty, in every way. Uncertainty about myself, uncertainty about my writing, my family life, the whole thing. And when people are so uncertain they can make a lot of jokes like that.
Protecting oneself.
V. S. Naipaul: Yes. It is the response, really, it’s the way you deal with it. And when a bit of certainty came in, with the writing, then I found other aspects of my personality now, without striving for them, entering the writing, and it was in that book. You are quite right, that fourth book was where another personality emerged which had been dragged out by labour, by literary labour.
And this book made you famous, is that right?
V. S. Naipaul: Not immediately. I’ll tell you what it did. It took a long time to get started as a piece of writing, and I think it took about seven or eight months to feel that it was a real book. And then it became grander and grander in my mind, and for the first time I felt I was a writer.
… and for the first time I felt I was a writer.
I used to walk the streets feeling very confident and I told someone that if, at that stage, someone had said to me, now, I’ll give you a million pounds, but on this condition, that you stop writing, I would have said no. It gave that confidence. So that was one of the great effects of it. It gave confidence in the handling of language. I told you I had to learn to write. Now, I haven’t told you that it was a deliberate learning. I forgot everything I knew when I was beginning to learn to write, and I did this thing about writing one sentence after another, adding one bit of meaning to another bit of meaning. And probably it became stilted. In this fourth book, the one you mentioned, I could let the sentences become longer, I could let there be subordinate clauses. I was very much aware of that feeling, I was confident enough to do that.";924;Motivation
And also it seems that you’ve won confidence in the form of the novel with that book, because it is a grand novel, on the scale of the Victorian novels that we know of the 19th century. I think of it personally as one of the very few examples in the 20th century of the truly successful novel, in the classical sense. Where did you learn the craft of the novel? Who were your models, if you had any?;"I had none. The learning came with what I had done before. That prentice work, those first three books, Miguel Street, The Masseur, another comic book, that, and the beginning of Mr Biswas, that was where I learned it. I learned it by the writing.
And the fact that you arrived in Mr Biswas as a novel on the grand scale, it came naturally out of the material, you mean?
V. S. Naipaul: Yes, and it began in a rather stilted way. So I wasn’t prepared for what happened. And again and again in my writing and in my literary life it comes with this idea of surprise, I’m taken by surprise. Things happen and I don’t know why. My original idea for that book, the fourth book, which you say is very big and successful, was very schematic. I thought I would have a man dying. My father had died in 1952 so that would be an element in that. And he’d be surrounded by a few simple pieces of furniture. Again, this would echo something in our past. And I thought he would tell the story, or the writer would tell the story, of the various pieces of furniture. I think by the time I got to writing the book, the schematic thing was abandoned. But I needed that to feel I knew where I was going. But I learned it myself. And what I was doing in that book, the big fourth book, everything was visual. There was a picture in every paragraph, and every sentence as I wished, every sentence adds, adds, adds. So the book is very fast and very pictorial. It was because I had had to learn for myself, really.";924;Motivation
Later on you wrote other novels, but gradually you came to move away from the novel in the classical sense. To me, this process begins already with The Loss of El Dorado, which is a book that resembles nothing else. I can think of very few parallels to that book. I mean, it’s not a piece of history in the ordinary sense, it’s not a novel, it’s not a fantasy, it’s documentary in a sense, but it has the atmosphere of a piece of fiction without being one. How did you find that form?;"Well, it came naturally because I was asked to do this book about a city, so I chose Port of Spain. And then I found that there were not the, the material was not available. So I had, living in London, to go to the sources. And of course I’m not an historian, not an academic historian. I look for the people, I look for the stories, and I wrote it in my own way, so the labour was quite immense. To write a paragraph of narrative, seemingly simple narrative, I probably had consulted about 20 documents. So every little detail about the commissioner’s wife, churning butter, thinking it was as good as Cambridge butter, little details, everything had been arrived at through the documents. And I was not interested in the other kind of history, only this human history. And I paid a bitter price for it.
In what sense?
V. S. Naipaul: No-one was interested in it. It’s very hard to imagine now, but 69 years ago that kind of work about the New World, and this place in the New World, from which I had come, it was not considered a good way of writing history, and the area itself was not considered important. It’s a singular way of looking at the world, but it existed in those days. I remember the man who wrote for The Times, he actually was a friend of mine, disliking the book, and saying I should have written a pamphlet. You know?
I’m glad you didn’t, though.
V. S. Naipaul: I’m glad I didn’t. So I paid a price, the American publisher who commissioned it didn’t pay for it, so I had to look around for another publisher. So I got very little money for two years’ hard labour. Anyway, there we are, that’s the story of that. And again, it was a writer working in his own way, and not knowing he was doing anything original. It just seemed natural.";924;Creativity
But you came to discover that you had landed upon a new way of writing, a new method in this book, because later when you reflect on, for instance, when you found the name Chaguanas in the archives you had become aware that there was something in fiction that didn’t quite suit your needs, and that you had to develop a form that was more tied to factual details, and to the actual utterings of people that you had met. And let me recall another thing you said, just the other week, at the press conference when you arrived in Stockholm, and someone asked you your opinion of Stendhal, and it so happened that you had just re-read his two major novels, and become violently disappointed with them, having been an ardent admirer of Stendhal. This must mean that to you the novel, after all, is a form of some importance and that makes high demands on its writer, and perhaps even a very gifted man like Stendhal was not able to answer to that demand.;"He couldn’t do it, he couldn’t do it. He had intelligence, he had a lot of social experience, he had the wish to be a writer, but there was something where the inspiration dried up very soon. And he couldn’t take you along, possibly because actually he probably had lived too full a life. Probably had found fulfilment in real life, whereas I think writers probably have to live more seriously in this other world, the world they create. I think it’s possible.
The parallel you made then was with Flaubert who lived in his country house without any life at all. It’s throughout long stretches of his life with only the rats for company, and some old ladies who sat with his mother on the ground floor. But where do you come in yourself in this, I mean, are you, do you feel yourself to be primarily a novelist? Personally, although I praised in my speech at the Concert House, your travel books and your non-fiction, I feel that maybe you are at heart a man of the imagination, because everything you write, even if it is based on factual details, seems to be, how shall I say, there is an all-pervasive vision that colours it and that melts it into something different, transforms experience into, well, literature. We don’t have to call it novel but it is definitely literature.
… one is so much seeking to understand the world through their eyes.
V. S. Naipaul: Well, they are almost works of the imagination. Although shall we say with the travel books, bad word, the books of enquiry, you know, on certain movements, one is so much looking for people. One is so much looking, one is so much seeking to understand the world through their eyes, these people who are quite different from me, and I’m interested in them, the way I’m interested in all people, and I try to present the world through their eyes, so inevitably, as you’ve just said, it does become a work of the imagination. It’s actually my writing imagination, observing and dealing with their experience.
Your style, that is a much discussed phenomenon. I even heard someone who had computed the average number of letters in a word in your texts and that should be four, I think, if I remember right. That may very well be correct. It’s obvious that to any reader the style strikes one as transparent and very clear, I think Coetzee said in an article recently that it’s cool and clean like a knife. And how do you arrive at that style? Is it something that comes naturally, or do you arrive at it by elimination, by crossing out words, removing unnecessary adjectives, and so on?
V. S. Naipaul: Well, it begins with what I said earlier about how I learned to write, when I try to get every sentence to say something. And I think that’s become a habit. I no longer think I’m doing it but that is the habit of writing. So the writing moves very fast. And then I do have to get everything I want to say into the sentences. I must be careful not in my speed to leave things out.
I made a speech, a two-minute speech, at the banquet, the awards banquet. I give you my word, that was written three times, there were three drafts for it. One draft, then typed out, that corrected, then corrected yet again, so as to get it all. And one aspect was to get the spoken language, to get it, the quality of speech in it, and the other thing was to, as it were, to get, well, I was talking with a watch, my watchstrap was broken, and I wanted to make a little story about this for the dinner. And I wondered about the symbolism, and I’d talk about various people in the past who looked for portents, and then I said well, yes, because I was coming to the ceremony, that it was OK, that’s what it meant, that time was going to stop and then time was going to become new. And so the watch then had become benign again. Now I had to, that came in about the third version, the watch was benign again. And it was telling me that my time was running out, and I had, I forgot to put in the first draft, it was telling me without threat that my time was running out. You know, that is, these are the little things I do. I hope, I’m sorry to give it in this little fine detail, but this is …
It’s most useful, I think, for the listener.
V. S. Naipaul: This is how the writing is done. What I don’t do, I don’t rewrite whole areas to make it fit. I write as I go along. There must be that progressive discovery.
That puts me in mind of the quotation from Proust that you used in your Nobel Lecture, with this melody that exists somewhere in the head, and you had to get down all the notes. And sometimes you miss a few, and then you have to return to …
V. S. Naipaul: You have to return and get the other notes …
… get the additional notes until they are all there and you sing the melody like it was meant. Well, that makes sense, somehow.
V. S. Naipaul: But it’s not done self consciously. It’s not done for effect at all. It’s done, in fact, not to be noticed.
Yes, and I mean when the melody’s there nobody sings what went before.
V. S. Naipaul: Exactly.";924;creativity
I think that if you look at your writing as a whole, there are at least to me two books that tower over the landscape, one we have already mentioned, A House for Mr Biswas, the other one being The Enigma of Arrival, which to me is one of the true masterpieces of contemporary literature, and an amazingly difficult book to describe. One doesn’t know quite what it is. Did that also just evolve?;"It just came to me to write it like that. It just absolutely came to me to write it with this outer autobiographical crust, about the man being a writer, and how out of this wish to be a writer, and out of social ignorance, he is still looking only for what he’s read, and when he comes to England, and missing the great stories around him in 1950, which England was full of, still, you know, the post-war refugees, the displaced persons they were called, I missed all of that, or the writer missed all of that, and was looking for what he had read in books, and at last the narrative, the outer narrative is he finds, he stumbles on his material, which is his own background, his past, the Empire, it gets ever bigger, and final irony, he comes to rest in the manner created by an Imperial fortune, which is now in decay. So the outer part was …
But this decay also, in a way, makes room for him.
V. S. Naipaul: It makes room for him, yes.
Which otherwise wouldn’t have been there.
V. S. Naipaul: Exactly, exactly. And he’s aware of that, and he’s grateful for it. Yes, it makes room for him.
And to a certain extent identifies himself, I think …
V. S. Naipaul: With the decay.
And also with his aristocrat he sees across the lawn. At least, there is a sympathy.
V. S. Naipaul: Yes, there is a sympathy. But I suppose if the writer in that book had got to know the aristocrat, had got to understand his limitations, had got to understand the boastfulness …
It’s like when Proust finally made his way into St Germain and discovered that the wonderful conversations that he had dreamed of didn’t exist, they were talking nonsense. It was as superficial as you could ever imagine.
V. S. Naipaul: But if I, if the writer had met the landlord figure, then probably he couldn’t have written that book. It’s better for the landlord to be vague, in the background. And I was very much aware when I was writing that, the word ‘landlord’ comes from Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is written in the first person, an unimportant person tells the story, and he just says I’ve just visited, or had a visit from, my landlord. And it was Mr Heathcliff, you know, who was the landlord. And that word, just used it there, but English, if you use the language, I’m afraid it’s full of these little echoes and verbal borrowings and things like that.
Every literary language is a kind of a churchyard.
V. S. Naipaul: Absolutely.
Other writers buried beneath.
V. S. Naipaul: Yes, good way, good way of saying it, yes.";924;Creativity
However, if you look at the title of that book, The Enigma of Arrival, it first puzzles the reader, but after a while you come to a chapter where the whole thing is explained, it goes back to a painting or, to be exact, a reproduction of a painting by de Chirico, and you make a sort of reading or interpretation of that painting and you tell a little story, and that is the enigma of arrival. Well, that story I personally find to be completely amazing. It so fascinated me when I read it, and also the fact that you make practically no use of that story in the book. It is just there, isolated. But still it radiates a sort of energy into everything else in that book. And I have to ask you, how you came to this fantasy, because it isn’t really in the picture. This is something that you have found.;"Ah well, I suppose it, in the de Chirico painting there is a sail, and the people, it is a quayside, if we can describe it, it’s very hard to describe it, nothing is strictly real. It’s a quayside and there’s half of a mast of an old fashioned sailing vessel, probably an old fashioned galley, and the figures look classical, so my thoughts go back to the classical world. It’s always interested me, the way the ships stayed close to the coast.
You think of Ostia, or something like that.
V. S. Naipaul: Something like that, yes. And then I thought of all the food and how it would have travelled, so it came like that, it came like that. And probably there might have been some element of a dream …
Yes, that’s what I was going to suggest.
V. S. Naipaul: … there would have been a …
There is a dreamlike quality to the tail. This way of losing one’s self. You have a goal in a dream but you never reach it, you know, you’re always diverted. Endlessly.
V. S. Naipaul: In that little story you liked, the man gets off the ship, he comes to the strange classical world, he has adventures and then he’s got to run away again because they become nasty adventures. And he …
Yes, that’s interesting. And how do they get nasty? Well, he becomes involved in some sort of religious procession, or ceremony, and suddenly you realise that he is going to be the victim. And that’s interesting because I think here we strike at a deep almost anthropological fantasy that has a real content, what one anthropologist has described as the original system of our culture, human sacrifice, which kept the community together by directing the evil energies to one particular person that was thrown out of the community and became a victim, was emulated and later sanctified, and transferred to God. I mean, you find this mechanism in all religions if you go far back. And I think there is a remnant of this in everybody’s psychology, especially people who, like writers, become a bit isolated in society, and are faced with groups into which they are never quite integrated.
V. S. Naipaul: I think you’re probably right.
They always fear that they’re going to turn into lynch mobs so it’s a potential in every group and congregation you meet, that they will discover the victim in you. That’s, I mean, I’m not taking this out of your writing because that’s a personal feeling that I have myself, and I was very touched by that when I read it, when I came to this detail in your dream, or your interpretation of it. But that’s the way it has to end, suddenly you realise that this place that seems so full of promise is actually a place where people are going to sacrifice you. And you have to get away.
V. S. Naipaul: But when he gets back to the quay, there is no sail. There is no ship. And it’s rather frightening.
Yes, it’s very frightening, because it means that his life is over.
V. S. Naipaul: Yes. And you, just this second, what I say is really quite true, things occur to be only when things are talked about. There is an echo of that in a book I wrote about Africa, four years later, A Bend in the River. It occurs right at the end, when the African boy, who is serving a dictator like Mobutu has cooked up a plan to kill Mobutu, has that dream, he says I have a dream, and how are we going to go, are we going to go in one car, or are we going to go in two cars? So, with the man who is going to be killed, would he be with the rest of us? Would we be able to talk with him, or … so it occurs again. It’s the same story. It’s the same story, and …
And it’s equally frightening.
V. S. Naipaul: … it’s equally frightening. Equally frightening. Yes, equally frightening.
And this, I think, is the basic element of epics, you know, that this possibility always exists. That you can always be the victim, unsuspecting, and you suddenly find yourself confronted with this, this mob that is going to destroy you.
V. S. Naipaul: Well, you know, that it’s your analysis and you know, I actually accept it.
I think it’s just a situation of literature, in a sense, too, and I mean, we’ve seen tragic examples of that over the last decades in various parts of the world. And whenever someone raises the voice against literature, like they have sometimes done when criticising your book, I always hear this murmur of the mob.
V. S. Naipaul: The mob. The academic mob.
Yes, it can be an academic mob, or it can be just a …
V. S. Naipaul: Yes.
… a vulgar mob. But it’s there, somewhere. That’s the frightening aspect of …
V. S. Naipaul: But fortunately I have worked in a free society, fortunately. And I have been able to ignore those murmurs and get on with my work. I could easily imagine, though, not being in a free society and really being, as it were, silenced. That’s unbearable. But there we are, there we are.";924;creativity
Well, one aspect of being a writer, I suppose, is that other people gain control of your myth. But this, in a way, recalls the fact that everyone has to live with that. You have a name, but the name is nothing having lent it, other people have called you by that name, and you don’t pronounce your name, other people do. You know, myself, a couple of years ago, I realised that I was no longer sure how my first name should be pronounced. It’s an English name, it comes from my grandmother, and my father used it with an English pronunciation, just like you do. But living in Sweden all my life, the pronunciation’s gradually been corrupted, and now people in the literary world usually say it in quite a different way, and there are three or four pronunciations of it, and when asked myself which is the correct one, I have no answer. Because I never use the name myself. Then I happened to come upon a passage in the letters that you published the other year, between father and son, which is the letters between yourself and your family, and there in a letter to Kamla, it’s your sister I understand, from 1952, you say like this. Let me quote: ‘Everybody calls me Vidiadhar. Disgusting name, and even I have got into the habit of calling myself that way.’ How do you feel today?;"Well, I was attracted to the long name. Vidiadhar. It is a Sanskrit compound word and it’s very simple. The word vidia has the same root as the word video, to see, from which we get everything, video, vision, everything, vista. So it means the bearer of wisdom. And I cherished it, you see, it was given to me, by my father, and at one time it was my only possession. It was my name as a child, so when it was shortened, I really felt I had debased it a little bit, yes. That was probably what was meant there. But now I have to live with that.
I suppose you have.
V. S. Naipaul: There’s a little question for me. There’s some talk of having a library with my name, and I am wondering what name I should give it. And I would very much like the full name, rather than this easy abbreviation. But I’ve thought about it like that. The name was important to me, and you know, one doesn’t wish to talk too much about things like this in this way, but there was a man I met, in India, who was a fan of my work, and to my great surprise he came to see me last year, an elderly man, of course, and then he turned up in Chicago to a reading I was giving and brought his daughter. He’d given his grandson my name, so this sort of magic was going on. He gave it as a kind of magic. So, it’s magical, magical.
But your comfort must be that whatever people will call you, your books will always retain your full name. That’s how it’s going to be preserved.
V. S. Naipaul: It will be preserved like that, yes, good.";924;Personal Characteristics
I wonder which factors have been of greatest importance for your career?;I was very fortunate to have been in the right environment and the right place at the right time, to have met the right teachers, and it started in elementary school, it went to the gymnasium I had wonderful teachers, in medical school I had wonderful inspiring teachers who always ask questions and stimulated us to think about things that weren’t known and so I was … When I did my medical doctorate I realised that many diseases are treated symptomatically and not in a causative manner and so I was very interested in learning more about diseases, the cause for diseases, this is why I went into research. I was very fortunate to meet George Palade who won the Nobel Prize in 1974, was a very stimulating man who shaped my career. So it was being in the right place at the right time and using the chances and the opportunities properly.;561;Career Development
And how important do you think the mentorship is?;Mentorship is very important because you have to learn how to formulate an idea out of the chaos of data that there is and out of the hints that there are that there may be a concept that you could distil out of this tremendous chaos of data and to integrate it into a new idea and that is something you have to learn.;561;Mentors(Role Models)
What comprises a good mentor?;A good mentor is a person who is not overpowering but is gently stimulating you and is opening up, helping you to open up a new world of ideas and that is what a good mentor is and who is passionate about what he or she is doing.  That’s the most important thing, to be passionate, to be really involved in what you want to do.;561;Mentors(Role Models)
How come you decided to leave Germany and move to the United States?;I left Germany in 1962 and at that time Germany was still recovering from war and there were not too many research institutes available at that time and the opportunities were much more impressive in the United States, and I also wanted to have an American experience, I wanted to learn English, I wanted to be exposed to the American way of doing research and so this is why I went to the United States. Not with the intention to stay but actually to stay there maybe for one or two years and then come back to Germany but then I, for many reasons, I continued to stay there and I’m still there.;561;Environment
Your work at Rockefeller University, there are many Nobel Laureates at that university. How does that come, what’s so specific or so special about Rockefeller University?;It is a fairly small place so that people know each other and you really … The administration of the place is not intrusive so that you have time to think about your research 24 hours a day. There’s only 150 students, graduate students and they’re very, very good graduate students with whom we interact on a more personal basis, there are something like 300 faculty and 150 students so the ratio is quite impressive and we know each other very well because it is a small place and we have time to think about research 24 hours a day, as I already said.;561;Environment
Is it possible to create a creative environment?;It’s very difficult to do that, even at Rockefeller you have to constantly recreate this environment and the environment of course changes, it’s not something which is taken for granted. Another thing that Rockefeller is unique is it doesn’t have departments, it doesn’t have departmental boundaries so that you can create new disciplines by intermingling new ideas and you create just a new department or a new laboratory. You don’t have laboratories at the Department of Biochemistry, you can call your laboratory anything you want to, Laboratory of Cellular Biophysics for instance, if you were very interested in biophysics, you can also change the name again if you want to if you want to pursue something else and that gives you great flexibility.;561;Environment
What would you … if I considered to go into medical research, what do you suggest that I should think of?;"Now that the sequence of human DNA will be done within a short time, you will have a vast amount of information, we will have the Rosetta stone of human biology at least and that will give tremendous new opportunities for all disciplines, be it neurobiology, be it cell biology, be it pharmacology, immunology, everybody … All of the disciplines will benefit from this tremendous amount of information which is coming but now we need people who can digest this information and can distil it out into new concepts.
We have to learn how proteins work in the context of a cell and in the context of the organism. Just to give you an example, in E. coli we know, in the bacterium, we know the sequence for some time but we still don’t know what 50 percent of the proteins are doing in E. coli and E. coli is a much simpler organism than a human cell. So this is going to be a great challenge for your generation to really teach us what are all these proteins doing and how are they doing it in the context of a cell, not only of a cell but the entire organism.
And look for a good mentor.
Gunter Blobel: Look for a good mentor, somebody who’s passionate, somebody who really loves science and forgets about everything else, for the moment at least.
And how important is the environment?
Gunter Blobel: So the environment is very important, that you really can focus and concentrate on science and you’re not distracted by too many other things, teaching is very important but we do not have to teach undergraduates which saves us a lot of time.";561;Advice  for young scientists
Let’s shift to something else. There are three key words in the will of Alfred Nobel. One is that the name of the prize is “Physiology or Medicine”, it’s not medicine which is physiology or medicine is a much broader field. The second thing is that the prize should be awarded for a discovery and it should be of greatest benefit to mankind. Of course the impact of these key words is consistently being discussed by the Nobel Assembly, but it is also now and then brought up in editorials in scientific journals. I don’t want you to judge the work that has been done by the Nobel Assembly but I would like you to put your work into these contexts in terms of discovery, in terms of benefit on mankind and physiology or medicine.;"Well, first physiology or medicine. What we have worked on is the very basic aspect of how cells work, not a human cell only, but also all animal cells, plant cells even bacteria and all. Cell is a unit of life and how does it deal with organising itself. It is not just a mail to send something to this or this address but it is … because it also deals with how membranes are put together, it really deals with the structural organisation of a cell, how does it organise itself into the various compartments and how does it maintain this organisation and that is a very fundamental aspect about how all cells work. Now the medical benefits of that is that we for instance in the production of proteins that, let’s take insulin, which was formerly gotten from slaughterhouses and was extracted, can now be made in bacteria and you can use a zip code to get the insulin out of the bacteria and then can separate it from bacteria much easier.
… this is just what we have studied so far, it’s just the tip of the iceberg …
And there’s not only the insulin, there are many growth factors like erythropoietin of which last year $2 billion were sold alone, important for people who suffer anaemia due to kidney failure and dialysis patients in particular so there is a huge market of medicines which has been developed which is in part, in part based on the discoveries which were made and there will be many more. It will be very important in the understanding of diseases; we already know that some diseases are caused by miss-targeting of proteins or by improper traffic patterns in the proteins so this is just what we have studied so far, it’s just the tip of the iceberg, there will be many, many other diseases that will have as a cause irregular traffic patterns or inability of the cell to organise itself properly.";561;Meaning(Values) of Work
So the benefit so far has mainly been to increase our knowledge but the benefit in terms of applications to treat the diseases will come later on?;"In a way it, you know, the fact that you can now make recombinant proteins in bacteria and in yeast and you will be able to make many, not just insulin and erythropoietin, many other gross factors and you can easily purify it, you can make it in large quantities as a huge quantum term. The fact that you had to previously go and isolate them from slaughterhouse animals like this contamination, is a huge jump forward which will help all of medicine. Now it’s not only based on my discoveries obviously, it’s based on the fact that you can make recombinant DNA and that you can express recombinant DNA and bacteria and so on but we have learned how to get the protein out of the cell and therefore we can purify it much easier. That is a very, from a practical point of view.
I had lunch at Upjohn Pharmacia and they’re producing growth hormone and this is half a billion dollars’ worth of growth hormone that is being produced in bacteria, right, and they are making now factor VIII or they have already made factor VIII which is on the market which something to do with blood clotting and so therefore a large number, a whole repertoire of proteins will be produced in this way. You will, you may be able to engineer cells and to get certain proteins into certain organisms and make them more efficient and that may be very important for cell therapy in the future so there will be future benefits to come down the line as a result of understanding how the cell works.
But I would like to emphasise that we are far away from understanding the cell, I don’t like to give the impression that this now we understand the cell, we are very, very far away from understanding cells. We may never completely understand the cell, we may hit something like the uncertainty principle in physics where while we are trying to measure something in the cell we disturb something and therefore the measurement that we are getting is faulty. But we are not at that level yet, we still are trying to map out very basic functions of the cell and we will have to understand the entire repertoire of functions and what principles the cells use in order for instance to find out how is a normal cell distinct from a cancer cell, because at the moment we treat cancer cells and try to kill cancer cells but we don’t know the differences precisely and therefore we kill many normal cells too. So we have to learn about cells, cells is the unit, basic unit of life and we have to learn how they work and what we discovered is the common principle which works in all cells.";561;Creativity
You get very excited when you talk about this. Is excitement and curiosity the main driving force, why you have done all this?;I’ve always had fun, I mean I was, my entire research sort of was hypothesis driven therefore I always imagined how things would be and then some of my fantasies of course turned out to be wrong and one must not be wed to one’s fantasies, one must when data come which aren’t compatible with one’s fantasies, one must abandon them. There are beautiful hypothesis killed by ugly facts and so one has to, but one has to also pursue and see whether one can get evidence for or against it and it’s wonderful to take a phenomena and then think about them and then imagine how it could possibly work and then see whether one can provide some evidence for or against it.;561;Creativity
Yes, I wonder what consequence receiving the Nobel Prize have for your future.;I’ve noticed in this last eight weeks that a lot of people have asked me for my opinions and one thing I want to be very careful about, I don’t want to give opinions that are not based on facts, I don’t want to now discuss atomic disarmament and all sorts of other problems, societal problems, economic problems, other problems that we are afflicted with which I haven’t studied because I, also I like to hypothesise. In the end I would like to have facts and there are certain things that I would like to do, I would like to do things that interest me, like to do something for Dresden, I don’t want to go into the details why, I want to like to do something for understanding between people, peoples, I want to do something for humanity, I want to give something back of the wonderful education that I have received but I will more or less continue my research as long as I feel that I can do it.;561;Impact of the Nobel on you
Ferid Murad, welcome to this interview with Nobelprize.org. Could we begin by you telling us a little about how you became a scientist in the first place?;"Ferid Murad: Thank you, I’m pleased to be here. I had a knack as a youngster for mathematics and science, I really enjoyed it, starting in the third and fourth grade. I found that those classes were so much more fun and appealing than some of the other classes, the English classes and the government classes and so forth. Some of the science teachers I had along the way were very encouraging and that helped to have the mentors there at the right time. When I was about 10 years old, I thought I was going to go into medicine. How I decided that I don’t know. My parents had very little education but I’d recognised the importance of education because of them. I thought my first choice would be medicine and my second choice would be teaching, perhaps mathematics or chemistry and my third choice was pharmacia or pharmacology. I’ve found that those goals haven’t changed. I think it’s because I really enjoyed science and mathematics, I had a knack for it and I did very well with it.
The humanities in school were not quite as exciting to me but I did it. I learned how to memorise, I played mathematical games in my mind. I’d walk down the street and memorise licence plate numbers, things like that. I developed lists of random numbers and tried to learn them all and memorise them. It was great preparation for medical school but because of the knack in science, I thought that what I should do is go into medicine. I also, because of teachers, thought teaching was a possibility. One summer, I was interested in butterflies with a friend, I was a youngster and we were catching butterflies. I didn’t want to touch them with my fingers as I mounted them with pins in this cloth or frame that I constructed, so I went to the local pharmacist and asked them if I could have some cyanide, potassium cyanide and hydrochloric acid and he gave it to me, today that wouldn’t happen.
Those were the days.
Ferid Murad: But that got me interested in chemistry and I also was thinking about the possibility of pharmacia or pharmacology and in eight grade we were asked to write a paper, an essay about career choices: What do you want to be when you grow up? My first choice was medicine and my second was teaching, being a professor, and my third choice was a pharmacist or pharmacologist. I’ve become all three of those. I guess I knew what I wanted to do and I had goals and worked very hard for it, but what really influenced the whole process so much was the recognition, the encouragement from so many mentors, high school teachers, college teachers and certainly graduate school and medical school. When I decided, instead of going to medical school, to go into an MD PhD programme which was a brand new, spanking new programme in Cleveland, had just gotten started.
That was the programme that Earl Sutherland began.
Ferid Murad: Earl Sutherland began that programme in Cleveland in 1957, a couple of years after he went there as chairman of the pharmacology department. Earl was an MD who was a clinician in the army and subsequently went back to St Louis and trained with Carl Cori in biochemistry and got interested in glucagon metabolism and phosphorylase and then as a very young man, went to Cleveland as chairman of pharmacology. A couple of years later he hired a young assistant professor, Ted Rall who was a biochemist and Ted looked after his laboratory as Earl did his administrative things, as the departmental chair, but Earl had an incredible vision as a physician and as a scientist, he could put it all together. Ted had the skills of how to do that right experiment and make it work, he had the hands for the laboratory and he insisted on all kinds of controls, so I was fortunate to have worked with both of them.
Earl had this incredible vision about how biology should work or did work, and Ted taught me how to do the experiments so that you would believe your data. Ted would ask for so many controls that, as an MD PhD student I kept flipping back and forth between medical school and graduate school because it was not a federally funded programme at the time, it was all pieced together with some of Earl’s donations from some /- – -/ companies for his interests with glucagon with Lilly, a training grad that he had and his research grads. In order to get my stipend, I had to spend so many months a year in the graduate programme, otherwise I’d have to forfeit my stipend, so I was flipping back and forth between medical school and graduate school and that was exciting and the curriculum was quite unusual. It was the first school, not only to create the MD PhD programme because of Earl, but also to teach in a different fashion with the working systems, it was a very integrated approach to teaching. One lecture would be anatomy and the next would be physiology and the next would be biochemistry and the next would be clinical applications, so you learned how to put it all together very quickly. Having worked with both Earl and Ted, who were quite different and having this curriculum, I just got really turned on and when I decided to go into this programme, instead of going to medical school, my parents were rather disappointed.
I can imagine, because you were taking a step away from a traditional career.
Ferid Murad: My parents wanted me to become a doctor and go home and practice in a small town on the south side of Chicago, Whiting, Indiana, and I didn’t know what to say to them. I looked at them and I said, If I become a doctor and come home and practice, in my entire lifetime maybe I can help 2 or 3,000 people, but if I go into research and if I’m lucky and find something important, I’ll be able to help a lot more. They then understood it and it made sense to them. I really got turned on, both in medicine as well as laboratory, got married, had quite a few children, we had four children when we finished that seven-year programme …
… and you needed a job to pay for them.
Ferid Murad: … and I wasn’t ready for a job, I wanted some more training, so I decided to take an internship of residency and went to Mass General and that’s where I got to meet Mike and Joe and a lot of other wonderful people.";563;Motivation
Tell me about the beginning of Mike Brown and Joe Goldstein’s relationship, because you were there at the start.;"Joe came from Dallas, he had gone to medical school at South Western and Mike came from Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, and they were both brilliant students. The whole group, there were only 12 interns in their class and I think all of us were the top one or two students in our classes, so we were all very bright people, but only a couple of us had experience in a laboratory. I was one, Tony Gotto was another with a PhD and the rest hadn’t had much experience in a laboratory, but that class turned out a lot of academicians and scientists, a stellar group: Tom Smith who became Head of Cardiology at the Brigham and Ed Scolnick who became President of Research at Merck and myself, it was really quite a group.Mike and Joe have had this extraordinary relationship of working so closely together for 35 years, did they recognise it immediately when they started?
Ferid Murad: No, I think they became friends initially, like we were all really good friends and colleagues. There wasn’t much free time in this process, we worked 100 hours a week and whenever you had a little bit of free time, we’d go to somebody’s house for a party. We’d steal some lab alcohol and make some punch and that was entertainment for a weekend. I think their relationship grew when they got to NIH. They worked in different laboratories, but I think their relationship was fostered and promoted. Then what happened was that Mike, after NIH, went to Dallas to do a fellowship in gastroenterology with Dan Foster, I believe, and Mike went to Seattle to do a fellowship in genetics.
Yes, Joe went to Dallas and Mike went to Seattle.
Ferid Murad: No, Mike was in Dallas and Joe went to Seattle.
Oh, really, okay.
Ferid Murad: Then Joe was recruited back to Dallas as a young faculty member and that’s when their collaboration began. It was probably, let me guess, I would say the early or mid-1970s, early 1970s probably. They were now both on the faculty, seeing each other and their relationship really took off, with genetic approaches lipid metabolism, that’s how it got fostered.";563;Creativity
Yes. One thing that you seem to emphasise when you talk about science is the amount of work that’s required and you just referred to 100 hour weeks. Is that something that came out of your background?;"Ferid Murad: My parents worked very hard, my father was an immigrant, he was an Albanian from Macedonia, he came to the US when he was young, 19. My mother he met later, she was American. Both came from very poor backgrounds, little or no education, they ended up in a family restaurant business, putting in long, long hours, 14-, 16-hour days. I grew up in that environment and although they had hadn’t had much education, they really encouraged their three sons and I was the oldest of three, to go on to school. If we were going to have a different lifestyle, we had to get an education and that was apparent and a lot of folks coming into the restaurant, this was a family restaurant where the workers and teachers and bankers were coming in for lunch, many of them became mentors and advisers and they kept encouraging me as well. My parents gave me an awful lot of freedom, they told me how important education was, I recognised how important it was and if I was going to have a lifestyle different than theirs, I had to have an education, but I saw the work ethic that was necessary to accomplish what you wanted to do. I was a bright kid, I had a pretty decent IQ I think, but I’m not brilliant and I made up for it with a lot of extra hard work and I think you can do that, so I’ve always, I think my whole life, worked 70, 80, 90, 100 hours a week. I still work 70, 80 hours a week.
That’s a message worth spreading.
Ferid Murad: You do it if you enjoy it, it’s not painful to do it, it’s fun to do it. It’s fun to go to work and solve problems.";563;Creativity
Another thing I think you stressed in some of your writings was the need for competition, the importance of competition.;"Ferid Murad: I think competition is important. I competed with my brothers, I competed with classmates in school, it was fun, we had a great time. One of my best friends I met in kindergarten, we’ve known each other ever since, he became an aeronautical engineer, he was on some of the projects with Boeing that built the Stealth Bomber, very talented aeronautical engineer. I went the medicine route but when we see each other, in the past we would compete with chess or we would compete with whatever and we still compete, but it’s fun.
Okay.
Ferid Murad: I say competition is very healthy, it motivates you, it drives you. It’s got to be friendly competition, it can’t be horribly aggressive competition, but it’s most fun when you win.
Yes, that’s true. I suppose that it’s a fine line to tread between friendly competition and unfriendly competition.
Ferid Murad: Correct.";563;Creativity
When you think of mentorship, what characterises a good mentor?;"Ferid Murad: It’s like raising a family, you want to encourage your trainees or children, you want to provide everything they need, the resources, the space, the equipment, ideas, but you expect them to contribute as well and what I enjoy is having, not arguments but discussions about my ideas versus theirs. I want them to be open and straightforward and tell me what’s on their mind, tell me when I’m wrong and I’ll do the same with them and that’s an interesting interaction and dialogue. There are lots of educationaI systems that don’t work that way, where the trainees feel suppressed, afraid to test the boss, ask questions and I think that’s wrong, that inhibits creativity, I think.
I suppose classically, medical training fits into that.
Ferid Murad: Exactly.";563;Mentors(Role Models)
When you recruit students to work in your lab, what do you look for in them?;Ferid Murad: I have a lot of international students. Of the 130 or so trainees I’ve had, probably ⅔, ¾ are foreign, from all over the world and the others are American, I mix them up. The trainees have backgrounds in genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, pharmacology, physiology, cell biology and I put them all together and they all teach each other something. They end up collaborating. They all have their separate projects and when they come to start working in the laboratory, I offer my ideas but I want them to meet everybody and come back with some of their own ideas and they will settle in on a project. They each have a project to work on, but all of the projects intermingle and overlap to some extent, resulting in collaborations and assistance from other people in the laboratory, so they’re all learning something. I learn a lot.;563;Competencies
How do you organise a lab where people are working on different projects, with different skill sets and yet you need them to interact?;Ferid Murad: We have lots of meetings, lab meetings weekly, where three or four of them will present their work over the last month or so, so over the course of a month, basically everybody has an opportunity to present what they’re doing. It’s an opportunity for others to see what they’re doing, learn about new techniques and ideas, opportunities to collaborate. I’m there to orchestrate, I’m there to provide the resources, test some of the ideas, offer ideas but not inhibit experimentation. I never ever tell a person not to do the experiment, I say if that’s important for you and interesting enough for you, you do it, even if it means doing it on your own time, you do it. I think it’s good and healthy for a trainee to discover something themselves and when they do, they really get into it, they really have ownership of that.;563;Environment
We’re a bit jumping out of temporal sequence, but when you found yourself in industry in the 1980s and 1990s, were you able to apply the same principles to allowing people to do their own experiments?;My laboratory, when I went to industry, was different than the other laboratories. It’s only because I went into the industry in a very senior position, with a lot of authority and a lot of resources and they weren’t hiring me to run a laboratory. They were hiring me to be an executive to run RND, but I said, If I’m coming into industry, the only way I will come is with my own laboratory, post-docs and grads, because I want to continue doing my own thing in the midst of all of this. They agreed to that, they didn’t want to lose me as a candidate, but once I got in the system, then they said, You’re really an executive, why are you running this laboratory? I said, I’m running the laboratory because I love it and how can I manage research if I don’t do it myself? You have to be able to do it and you have to be an example. I’ve always thought that, as an administrator – and I’ve become more and more of an administrator over the years – that I have to do better and more research and more funding than anybody else to be a leader. If I can’t do that, I shouldn’t be a leader, so I work very hard at it.;563;Research
Were you able to have any influence over the way that Abbott [Laboratories], as a whole, did its research?;"I influenced a lot of projects. I terminated some that I didn’t think were going to be successful. It’s very difficult to do that, you have to do it slowly and it’s not easy and created a lot of new projects. I think I was having a lot of fun at Abbott, learning an awful lot about the pharmaceutical industry, about toxicology and formulation and marketing and acquiring a lot of skills, that I hadn’t had from academics, but what disturbed me was my senior managers. There were about three people above me in the company, were marketing sales types, they were not scientists and their philosophy and notion about science was quite different. They thought that you could open the spicket and turn it off at will, they didn’t realise that you had to have a programme going on for some five or ten or 15 years sometimes before you saw a product come out of it and that you couldn’t just stop it all of a sudden for fear that you’d chase off a lot of talented scientists. I was also concerned that their investments in RND were not sufficient compared to their investments in sales and marketing. The sales marketing budgets were twice the RND budgets and that didn’t make sense to me for a technology-based company.
Is that still the case?
Ferid Murad: Yes, it is, in fact it’s getting worse and I think that’s why the pipeline in large multinationals is drying up.";563;Creativity
We’ll return to that theme in a little while. I wanted to focus on the discovery that in particular led to the award of the Nobel Prize, together with Robert Furchgott and Louis Ignarro in 1998. You found that nitroglycerin, which had been around for 100 years and used to relieve chest pain and angina, works by the release of nitric oxide which is an unusual signalling molecule because it’s a gas and the question that seems to be begging is how come nobody had found this for 100 years?;"If you went looking for a gas or a free radical as a messenger, it would be an impossible project and the way we discovered it was really through the back door, through another avenue. I grew up in Cleveland working with Sutherland and Rall, interested in cyclic AMP. How do hormones regulate cyclic AMP and what are the biological effects of cyclic AMP to regulate glycogen metabolism, fat metabolism etc?
Cyclic AMP being the first second messenger.
Ferid Murad: The first intra-cellular second messenger and then in the mid-1960s, cyclic GMP was discovered by some chemist. I kept an eye on the field because I was intrigued with that notion of another messenger molecule and over the next few years, a couple of messengers started popping up. Calcium came along, prostaglandins were looking promising, diacylglycerol was looking promising, cyclic GMP started looking promising and when I left my training in NIH to go to my first faculty position at Virginia in 1970, I said, I’m going to switch from cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP. As a young faculty member, I saw a lot of activity in the field of cyclic AMP research, a lot of laboratories were now working with this. In 1971, Earl Sutherland got the Nobel Prize for that, so that attracted even more people and I didn’t want to compete with these big factories as a young faculty member. I thought there was a lot of high risk to that and I saw cyclic GMP as a new emerging field where I could take my information and ideas from the cyclic AMP field and work in another direction, so I made the switch to cyclic GMP. I wanted to figure out how hormones and drugs regulated cyclic GMP production and what are some of the biological effects of cyclic GMP, those were unknown at the time.
In our very first experiments we found that tissue extracts contained not just one enzyme to make cyclic GMP but at least a couple, a soluble activity and a particulate activity. With some biochemical studies we thought they were different isoforms, one had cooperativity with substrate, the other did not and I thought, wouldn’t it be interesting, whereas adenoid cyclase at the time appeared to be a single isoform in the membranes. We now know they’re mini-isoforms but in those days we thought there was just one and for guanylate cyclase, it’s cousin, to now have multiple isoforms. I thought wow, this is interesting, they’re different compartments in the cell, perhaps they are different hormones and mechanisms to regulate each of these enzymes. There will be different pools of cyclic GMP in the cell, perhaps with different functions and wouldn’t that be an interesting complicated problem to tackle? We went after it, it turned out hormones wouldn’t activate the enzyme in cell free preparations, which was one of our goals, we wanted to figure out how hormones worked, how did they couple to the cyclase regulation? They didn’t work in cell free systems and because we thought we had different isoforms, I thought maybe different hormones would work on each isoform differently. Ultimately we had to purify those isoforms and clone them and express them but that took a long time, that took 12 years probably, so I took a shortcut and threw in the kitchen sink. I knew that you can’t trust kinetic data in crude preparations room for a lot of artefacts. Our preparations had nucleotidases, phosphatases, phosphodiesterases, competing for substrate, competing for a product that we were measuring, so what we were seeing could have been spooky and erroneous…
Artefactual, yes.
Ferid Murad: I took a shortcut and made a cocktail of all sorts of inhibitors like you pull off the shelf, to inhibit nucleotidases, phosphatases, phosphodiesterases, pyrophosphrate, fluoride, azide, hydroxalamine, methylzanthines.
As you say, everything that was on the shelf.
Ferid Murad: Everything I thought would inhibit this pathway and re-examine the kinetics and accidentally found that some of these compounds activated the enzyme. Azide, hydroxalamine and sodium nitrate and that was an important lead. As a student, I recognised the importance of fluoride activation about doing cyclase. We had another small molecule in the cyclic AMP system, that turned out to be very valuable in understanding the role of adenoid cyclase regulation and the role of G proteins.
So you were pre-warned to look for small molecule activation.
Ferid Murad: Yes, there was a precedent for it and now we stumbled into another class of small molecules that did it with guanylate cyclase and I said, Maybe these will be hormone surrogates that are bypassing the system. Obviously the hormone receptor binding at the cell surface is not communicating to the cyclase. In a cell free preparation we’re missing something but these are activating, maybe they’ll help us figure out what we’re missing and that’s what led us in the nitric oxide, we took these compounds and we put them in the tissues and they raised cyclic GMP levels in lots of tissues, including smooth muscle. I thought cyclic GMP in smooth muscle would cause contraction. As a student I knew that cyclic AMP caused relaxation, I thought they would antagonise each other.
But no?
Ferid Murad: That’s not what we saw, they caused relaxation and once we saw that we said, What do other smooth muscle relaxants do? What does nitroglycerin do and what does nitroprusside do? We put them in and sure enough, they elevated cyclic GMP levels and I don’t mean intact cells but in broken cells. Now we ended up with a family of molecules that were capable of increasing cyclic GMP levels in intact cell cultures and slices and tissues, as well as activating the soluble isoform of guanylate cyclase. Then it became a mystery story for a couple of years. What is this intermediate, they’re all pro drugs and an important lead for us was the discovery that some tissues did not respond to azide. That’s because they possessed inhibitors and we purified those inhibitors and they were haemoglobin and myoglobin, so we knew that haem proteins could somehow interfere with the activation. We had a long list of we call nitro vasodilators, they were all nitrogen containing, some were nitrose, nitrosos, hydrazines, whatever. We said, Could the intermediate by nitric oxide? because in the literature, we found papers with a very high affinity of nitric oxide for the haem prosthetic group of these proteins …
Okay, so it was binding nitric oxide.
Ferid Murad: … and we said, Let’s see if it’s nitric oxide, and sure enough it was. That’s how we found it. It was accidental, some biochemical you know, rationalisation, serendipity, it happened that we had to have smooth muscle in the lab at the time.
Yes, many things coming together and above all, a preparedness to look at the data in a particular way.
Ferid Murad: We were approaching it from a very biochemical direction but I thought in a very meaningful, logical, sequential fashion. The big mystery is, how do we jump from all these nitro vasodilators, which we thought were pro drugs to the activator of G cyclase. We stumbled with it for a couple of years and then finally we realised there could be nitric oxide and made it and sure enough it worked.";563;Meaning(Values) of Work
Have you pondered whether there were people out there in previous decades who were close to the possibility of solving this problem?;"Yes, there some other laboratories, one that I remember quite well. A fellow up in Minnesota, Nelson Goldberg who was also interested in cyclic GMP, trying to figure out what regulated this production, what were some of its functions? He was working with lymphocytes and a lot of other systems. Nelson was really a very aggressive, hustling, clever scientist, however Nelson, although he was a good friend, we were fierce competitors and a lot of stuff that he did I didn’t believe. I could never tell whether Nelson did the experiment once or a dozen times and Nelson had the preconceived notion of this is what cyclic GMP should do, it should antagonise cyclic AMP. He came up with yin yang hypothesis, one goes up, one goes down, this was all nonsense in my opinion, because we couldn’t see any of that sort of stuff, but what it did for us is motivated us to work harder. We were trying to be number one and Nelson was very close, he could have, had he not forced his data to his preconceived notion of how things worked, he probably could have found before us, but he was forcing all the data to fit what he believed should be and I think that’s always a bit mistake in science. Instead of really saying, this didn’t work the way I thought it would work, maybe something else is going on. That’s what Ted Rall taught me to do. Earl Sutherland taught me to be as imaginative and free associating as you can be, just pluck it out of here and there and try to figure out how to put them together, his mind was incredible. Ted taught you how to pigeonhole all of it into a spot and do the experiment in such a way that it was either right or wrong. So it was fun to have had that experience working with both of them.
Yes, you got the air and the land right there.
Ferid Murad: Yes, when we did an experiment and I got a result, I knew I could believe it and if it didn’t fit my ideas, I said, Something else is going on, let’s go think about this now.
Following up on the story, you then had Furchgott discover quite rapidly that there was this thing, EDRF, Endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and that that was the mechanism of action of certain drugs action on the smooth muscles surrounding blood vessels, but it took another six years or so for the connection between nitric oxide and EDRF to be made. Lookingback, it seems perhaps to students …
Ferid Murad: For some people it took six years.
Oh right, oh okay.
Ferid Murad: I’ll tell you this story.
Yes, please tell me the story because it seems, looking back, that it might have been an obvious …
Ferid Murad: Robert Furchgott was a vascular biologist, pharmacologist for many, many years. I met him as a student in Cleveland when I was a graduate student. Earl Sutherland would bring dignitaries through for seminars and I got to meet Furchgott very early on, in the days where he was looking at receptor theory and receptor abundance and excess receptors in vascular preparations. It had been known for a long, long time that some agents, acetylcholine, histamine, others would lower blood pressure in animals or man, they were hypertensive vasodilators, but they would never work in the laboratory and that’s because the integrity of the endothelium was destroyed in the process of making those preparations. One day, Bob gave an experimental protocol to his technician and instead of making strips where they would take a muscle and open it up and put it on their finger and clean off the tissue and mount it on the hooks, in the process what you’re doing is touching the endothelium and destroying it. His technician took a short cut and just like the salami, whacked off rings and hung them up and now they caused relaxation. It was a different preparation with the endothelium intact and Bob is so meticulous and clever that he realised the difference. He said, My goodness, now we have the endothelium and here we didn’t.
Now the other tip-off: one day their chambers were near a window and they had a shade and somehow they put up the shade or put it down, one or the other, and they noticed that when they opened the shade, the muscles relaxed, when they closed the shade, they contracted – he had light induced relaxation. When we found nitric oxide activation of guanylate cyclase, I was very excited to find a free radical activating enzyme, that was a precedent and it had never been shown before. I thought perhaps other free radicals might regulate other enzymes and I knew that there was a lot of free radical chemistry and photo chemistry, so we’d drink cocktails with riboflavin and other goodies in our preps and would shine light on them and try to activate the enzyme. On one occasion we were successful, but we could never repeat it, but when it worked once, I knew it had to work, but we couldn’t repeat it, something was different the next time we did it. Again, it reflects Ted Rall’s assistance in how to design an experiment, if you’ve got your data, you can believe it, but if you can’t reproduce it, it doesn’t mean it doesn’t work, it means you’re doing it differently, but we could never get it to work. When Furchgott found this factor coming out of endothelial cells that caused relaxation of smooth muscle, he came through Charlottesville to give a seminar, all excited about these endothelial dependant vasodilators and EDRF. This was in the spring of 1980, before his Nature paper. After his seminar, I buttonholed him and took him off to my office and I said, Bob, EDRF with a short half-life of several seconds is a reactive species, it’s probably a free radical or some other reactive molecule and I think it’s going to work through cyclic GMP and it might be something like nitric oxide or a complex, let’s collaborate and figure this out. We agreed to do that. It turned out that in that trip to Charlottesville, his wife fell, broke her hip, turned out she had metastatic breast cancer in her hip, they returned to New York and he was so distracted with her breast cancer. Shortly after that I started looking at Stanford, we moved the lab out to California, so we never collaborated, I wish we had.
Yes, that’s a missed opportunity.
Ferid Murad: Yes, we lost about a year or so because we hadn’t collaborated because of his experience and hers, but then we got out to Stanford, I moved in the summer of 1981, about a year after his visit. Michael Peach, a pharmacologist from Virginia and a colleague and a vascular biologist, interested in prostaglandins but also following the EDRF story, came to visit and consult for syntax across the street from the VA where my office and labs were. He came over one afternoon, we were chatting and he said, What are you doing with EDRF? and I said, Mike, we’re waiting for samples from Furchgott, we’re going to collaborate and see if it works with cyclic G, I think it will, but we never gotten any samples from him, as far as I know. I said, Let me call the post-doc in who was going to do the experiment. I called in Robert Rappaport who was with me at the time and I said, Robert, have you ever gotten samples from Furchgott’s lab? He said, No, and then he smiled. I said, Robert, what’s going on? Sheepish smile. He said, I’ve been stashing samples away that I’ve been doing in the Revco. I said, Robert, this is an example of a trainee who’s inquisitive enough to take the time to do it, but he’s afraid to tell the boss, but he’s doing the right thing. How can you ever inhibit that sort of activity, behaviour? You don’t want to do that. I said, You better go back to the lab and get all those azides and sure enough it worked and we then showed that EDRF worked through cyclic GMP. That was a nice follow-on story to Bob’s work. Shortly thereafter, he and Ignarro and even Muncada started saying the EDRF might be nitric oxide and I said, No it’s not. I said, Maybe you’re making nitric oxide but what is in that interstitial space regulating the smooth muscle, has got to be something else.
Why did you think it had to be something else?
Ferid Murad: Because NO’s a free radical and is going to collide with all sorts of stuff and it won’t survive, it has a short half life, a few seconds. To this day, I believe that the enzyme, nitric oxide synthase makes NO, no doubt about that, we’ve purified most of them, it doesn’t have others, but I think that Furchgott’s EDRF is a family of molecules. NO is a candidate, nitrosothiols, nitrosamines, nitros of fatty acids. All of those are EDRFs, as defined by Furchgott.
How generally accepted would that view be now?
Ferid Murad: Nobody wants to accept it. I’ve been saying that since about 1988 or 1989.";563;CPS
I remember in the late 1980s, people sitting around in the coffee room in the pharmacology department in Oxford, disbelieving the possibility that EDRF could be NO.;"Ferid Murad: The enzyme makes NO, NO certainly gets through the lipid bile air. It can go one or 200 extra from studies now with electrodes and other methodologies, but I think it’s a family of molecules and all of those are capable of delivering NO as NO donors to activate G cyclase.
Is the hypothesis testable, is there any way that you could actually …?
Ferid Murad: I don’t think so with current technology. I think the concentrations of EDRFs in that interstitial space are so low that we just don’t have methods to identify them and isolate them and mass spec them or whatever we’re going to have to do. I think that they could well be several or a family of molecules, all of which are capable of relaxing smooth muscle. If you look at Furchgott’s definition, which is sort of a loose definition, all it is, is a substance with a short half-life that relaxes smooth muscle. That can be a lot of things. The enzyme no doubt makes NO, NO comes out, that’s been measured with electrodes and with theoretical calculations, distances of 100 to 200 microns are possible, so for small vessels there may be enough, for big vessels, I’m not sure it gets that far, but how do you determine what it is, it’s going to take some new approaches.
Apart from the basic interest of knowing that EDRF would be a family rather than a single entity, are there practical applications?
Ferid Murad: I don’t know. That’s something that’s been pointed out to me, does it really matter? If NO is made and NO activates the enzyme and is responsible, does it matter what’s in between? Probably not, but as a scientist you like to know.
Yes, it’d be nice to know.
Ferid Murad: I think if you knew some of the substances that were in between, perhaps the chemists and the pharmacologists could in the future design molecules to either protect or scavenge them in some way and that might lead to a new approach for drug development.
It would seem to offer the possibility of more cell activity.
Ferid Murad: Maybe.";563;Creativity
You did find yourself in industry for a few years and then you returned to Houston, to the lab. Did the sojourning industry change your approach to the way you ran your lab, did experiments?;"My laboratory in industry was an academic laboratory, it was no different than what it was at Virginia and Stanford. We turned out to be a resource for reagents for other laboratories. Other laboratories were becoming interested in cyclic G, in phosphodiesterases in other words. We had reagents, antibodies, whatever, that we were supplying other laboratories. But we were sort of an island in the midst of the company really and I think the laboratory was viewed differently by other scientists and perhaps favoured by me, which I’d hope was not the case, that we had more freedom, our own grant money and post-docs, things that other people in the company didn’t have. It made for a little discomfort in the company. There was pressure on me to give it up, I refused to do that. The reason I gave it up is because I was concerned about some of the decisions being made by senior management. We had some problems where drugs should have been pulled from the market and weren’t. We had situations where they would not pursue directions for research that I thought were important. One of the examples, in Virginia I collaborated – about the time we discovered NO actually – with an Infectious disease faculty member, Dick /- – -/ who was interested in third world diarrhoeal disease, particularly Bangladesh at the time, he had been in the Public Health Service for a while. He had a strain of E-coli that produced a heat stable endotoxin that caused diarrhoea. He had worked previously at Hopkins showing with Bucky /- – -/, the /- – -/ toxin increased cyclic AMP production toxin and he thought that perhaps this toxin would do the same, increase cyclic AMP and cause diarrhoea. I said Ok, we’ll help you work out the mechanism, but I want to look at cyclic G also.
Sure enough, this toxin activated the particular isoform guanylate cyclase and it was a new novel pathway for diarrhoea. It turns out both cyclic AMP and GMP activated the inappropriate kinase in the intestinal mucosal epithelial cells. Those kinases which you’re going to hear from Edmond Fischer this week, phosphorylate, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance channel, the chloride channel. When it’s phosphorylated, chlorine comes out the cell as does sodium, water and that’s the mechanism of diarrhoea. I’ve always wanted to find a compound that would block that pathway and I wanted to work on it at Abbott, because it was such a simple, straightforward problem and we had the resources to find it pretty quickly, I think, but I wasn’t permitted to work on. I didn’t understand why and one day my president said, It’s a third world disease, we’re not interested in third world disease, there’s no profit.";563;Creativity
Given the current antagonism towards the pharmaceutical Industry that this is a generic problem for them, one would have thought that such PR exercises at the very least would be;"If it were Merck, with Roy Vagelos, he would probably have said, Go chase it, Ferid, but Abbott and others wouldn’t have done that. What has happened is, I left Abbott for a variety of reasons. I learned as much as I could about the industry, I was a little concerned about how things were going, a little bit concerned about the lack of freedom to work on things that I thought were important. We had compounds that could have been very effective in a lot of infectious diseases in AIDS patients, they didn’t want to chase it. Ultimately they did but they wouldn’t listen to me. I was the senior scientific officer, I felt it strange that they wouldn’t listen. I said, Okay, time to go back to academics and I went to Houston, I looked at some other opportunities and chose Houston, but now we have found such a compound and I’m really excited about it. I’ve screened the library, we have a hit, a lead, we’ve got a compound that not only blocks guanylate cyclase activation by E-coli heat stable enterotoxin, but it blocks G cyclase activation by guanylin in intestinal peptide. It blocks /- – -/ toxin activation by adenoid cyclase, it blocks /- – -/ and epinephrine activation of adenoid cyclase, it blocks atriopeptin activation of guanylate cyclic. This is a marvellous compound, I think it’s going to be universally effective in all the diarrhoeal diseases.
Where is it now, the compound?
Ferid Murad: Right now we’ve patented it, we’re trying to do some initial chemistry to make some analogues. We know it works in vivo, in animal models, it does block diarrhoea due to toxin, it blocks anthrax, it really is marvellous. Now the problem is to move it forward into toxicology, medicinal chemistry, analogues, formulation and then the clinic and that’s tough to do in academics.
Yes, you need a trustworthy partner in industry.
Ferid Murad: I can do it, if I had the resources and money, I could do it because I’d have the experience, I know how to do it. It’s easier to do in industry, where the resources exist and the money exists, but I’ll find it and one way or another I’ll find it. I’m really anxious to get this into some clinical trials.
It matters but it’s tough.
Ferid Murad: I know. I figure it’s going to take me five or six million dollars to get it into clinical trials and at that point we’ll stir up some interest. I think it may also work in inflammatory bowel disease and that’s where the interest will come. If we can get it to work in inflammatory bowel disease, the big companies will be interested and hopefully they’ll give it away to WHO for third world diarrhoea or something.
Yes, otherwise one goes the route of finding Gate’s money or something.
Ferid Murad: I’d try all the avenues I can at the moment. I’ve told people I’m going to sell my house if I have to.";563;Environment
I wish you a lot of a luck with that. That’s a tremendous project. I think to finish, I’d like to just discuss a little bit more about what it is that you think is most important for medical students now to understand. You yourself had training and very novel training in the 1950s based on basic research and medical training combined and of course MD PhD programmes are very popular now, but the majority of medical students don’t go through this.;"I think there are in the US, I believe, out of the 126 medical schools, probably about 30 or 40, maybe a little more with MD PhD programmes and typically they only have a handful of students, although some programmes like Washington University and a few others are much larger, but typically less than 5 or 10% of the class is MD PhDs. They’re always very good students. The programme is designed to, in my opinion, train academics to come back and do research, either in a clinical department or a basic science department, one or the other. If you look at the spread, people have done both, people have gone into clinical departments to research or basic science departments to research. Some of us have done clinical training, ended up in clinical departments and then switched to basic science departments, as I have. Others have not done clinical training and gone into basic science departments. I don’t think it matters. I think the programme is designed to train academics to come back and teach and do research. The difficulty that we’re having, certainly in the US and I’m sure it’s true here in Europe as well, is that for the clinical faculty member to do research today is becoming extremely difficult because of managed healthcare. You have to spend so much of your time seeing as many patients as possible to satisfy the budgets and financial justification of the programmes, that there’s no time left for research. For many, many years, I have always believed that you have to emphasise one or the other, it’s wonderful if you can do everything, I wish I could, I tried for some time, but after a period I had to decide whether I was going in for science clinical medicine and teaching or research. I chose the research track, but I always tried to do research in a clinical department, so I could impact and influence the clinical faculty and collaborate with them.
Today, it’s very, very hard to do both. You can only be an expert if you spend most of your time doing one thing, whether it’s research or patient care. If you’re doing patient care and it’s part-time, you’re not going to be the pro, an expert, you’re not going to get the referrals from your colleagues. They’re going to send them to the person who’s doing it full-time. If you’re not doing research full-time, you’re not going to get the grants. Now it doesn’t mean 100% of the time but certainly more than 50 or 60 or 70%. You’ve got to choose, it doesn’t mean that you can’t be concerned about the other and participate to some extent, but to be the triple threat and be the perfect teacher and clinician and scientist, that’s not feasible these days. It’s going to be frustrating for students, more so than it was for me, to make those choices. I took it all, I absorbed it all because I enjoyed it all, but at some point I realised I’ve got to emphasise one thing or the other. I think it’s going to be a little harder for people to make those choices. Educational costs are escalating through the roof, people can’t take the long training programmes that I went through. I trained for 12 years after college, let me think, is that right? Yes, 12 years. It’s hard to do and I did it with a family, with five kids, it was very hard to do.
You’d have to go into practice after that these days, just to pay for it.
Ferid Murad: Exactly, well that’s what’s happened. I have a son-in-law who’s a cardiologist and another son-in-law who’s a neuroscientist, one’s a PhD. and one’s an MD. The MD has done a lot of research, cancer research, cardiovascular research, he’s probably spent about four or five years in the laboratory. He got himself an American heart fellowship and the whole bit. He grew up in California, he wanted to go back to California. To afford housing in California and pay off all of his debts, he had to go into practice, so now he’s a cardiologist in California to pay all of his past loans and move into a house. He’d loved being an academic but I don’t think he can afford to do it, which is sad.
Yes, so now it’s a case of do one thing and do it well.
Ferid Murad: Yes.
On that note, I guess we should stop. Thank you very much indeed for taking the time to talk to us.
Ferid Murad: I think the important message for young people … When I was a student, I absorbed everything, I never cut a single class in my career because I thought everything was important. I couldn’t determine what was important and what wasn’t, therefore I learned it all. In our faculty we’d say, half of what I’m going to tell you is true and real and the other half is not, but I can’t tell you which half, so I would learn it all. Today that’s different and I think that education is so costly that you can’t afford not to take advantage of it, the opportunity and what you’re learning may not be applicable later on, but it prepares you to learn it later and you’ve got to do what you enjoy doing. It doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you enjoy it and do it very, very well, the best you can be.";563;Environment
Welcome to meet the Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine for 1997, Dr Stanley Prusiner, the man who did as very few scientists do, but all of them will get Nobel Prizes I think, they really turn the concept we have upside down, and please tell me Dr Prusiner, what did you really turn upside down?;"I’m not sure I turned anything upside down, it was a discovery that people really didn’t want to accept for a long time because it went against so many preconceived notions. The idea that a protein was infectious and the disease could be both genetic and infectious and then even spontaneous. These were concepts that people had a hard time accepting.
But why was it so controversial?
Stanley B. Prusiner: I think that it was a long time in coming to understand that genes are made of DNA or RNA, primarily DNA. That all infectious agents, the progeny of all infectious agents are encoded by a strand of DNA or RNA and in fact all organisms. So, the idea that there should be something totally different and it should be “alive”, it can replicate in a biological system, just I think was very difficult to accept and I think people were justified in being sceptical because the discovery that DNA is the genetic material of life didn’t occur until the middle of the 20th century.";565;Impact of Nobel on you
So in a way you challenged the central dogma of molecular biology at that time, that all the information was contained, the DNA and the RNA and the proteins were just the templates or the churning out of the … Now you’d proved that proteins in itself, in these cells right could contain information so to say?;Yes and no. In the beginning it seemed that way, that we were challenging the dogma and as the story emerged, it became very clear that it fit within the dogma of biology, but that one had to make small revisions and these revisions turned out to be groundbreaking in many other areas. The concept that a protein could then exist in two biologically active forms was not well accepted and in fact they were not good examples.;565;CPS
It took you 10 years to come to this conclusion, to really put forward the proofs for your idea. What kept you going when everyone was suspicious about the ideas?;"Yes, this was a 25 year project, it took me about 10 years to really get into it and lay out what I thought were the real possibilities and then another 10 years to gather the information that made it clear that these ideas were not science fiction but in fact they were real and that people who were sceptical were certainly justified but that there had now came a point where their scepticism no longer was really useful.
But what kept you going, I mean 25 years ago, tell me?
Stanley B. Prusiner: When you make a discovery like prions, you become very passionate about it and you look for other things that are as interesting, where you might not find as much human opposition and when you can’t find something, if you’re not very imaginative, you’re not very bright and you are unable to find another project that’s as exciting, then you say to yourself, well, I’ll just keep going on this and nothing better that I can work on.";565;Creativity
But despite that all the colleagues, well not all but the scientific community around you, really thought you were doing mad things?;"Not everybody, there were enough people who were very supportive and who provided the day to day support as well as being sufficiently convinced that we were doing good work to act as peers in the review of the work, so that it was supported by the National Institutes of Health, because otherwise we would have never been able to survive. In addition we had some private funding that was very important.
That is important.
Stanley B. Prusiner: Yes, the philanthropy was critical.";565;Creativity
It’s seven year now since you came to Stockholm to get the prize and I wonder what has happened since?;My life has been a little more hectic. In some ways I’ve relaxed a little bit more, although many people would not tell you that was true and the work has continued to move forward.;565;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Has there been any difficulties, I mean, there were controversies even when you got the prize, in the protein only had part of this work challenged for many respects and as you come up with some even more definite proof that is the protein only theory will hold?;"Yes, this past summer we published two papers, one piece of work we made a synthetic prion with a peptide that we synthesised in the chemical means. This was culminated in four years of work where we’d published the first paper in the year 2000, so that was three years after the prize and then a follow-up paper this past spring. Then in the summer we published another paper in which we made the protein in bacteria and isolated the protein and then refolded it and showed that we’d made a synthetic prion that way. So we’ve done this two different ways where we’ve started with a sequence that either produced an E-coli or produced by chemical means and then changed the confirmation of the protein and turned it into an infectious pathogen.
And you proved that this synthetic infectious prion managed to alter the shape of the proteins, the prions in the infected animal?
Stanley B. Prusiner: If they didn’t do it, then I don’t know what did it.
But you were challenged on this as well, afterwards.
… even after we published these papers, we were challenged by people …
Stanley B. Prusiner: Oh yes, even after we published these papers, we were challenged by people, not a lot, most people think that we have finished the task of convincing the world but I think, you know, there are a few, and that’s normal and they probably will never be convinced.";565;Creativity
When you received your prize, you also gave the banquet speech where you said something like, the Nobel Prize is a celebration of science, yes and culture.;It’s a celebration of science and culture, well an intellectual achievement in our civilisation and it’s really, I think, unique. There is no other celebration like the Nobel Prize celebration.;565;Impact of Nobel on you
It’s interesting, you mention science and culture together. We just got a new minister in Sweden, in science and culture, the same minister and the same department, Science and Culture, and when he gave a press conference just when he entered his chair, he didn’t get a single question on science from the journalists, just about culture.;"I think that’s not surprising. I think it’s very difficult for people to ask questions about science just off the top of their heads and I think one of the problems I had with the press for so long was that they were so uneducated about science. Now to be fair to the press, they have very little time to write a story or to produce a story and so being thrown into an area where some scientists are telling them the work is excellent and others are telling them that it’s complete fraud and craziness – they don’t know how to judge. I can well imagine, when the Minister of Culture and Science is appointed and the press is asked to come to a press conference, if the press conference materials don’t lay out in detail an agenda for science, so in an understandable lay language, then I can well understand they may not ask any questions.
But maybe you could also wonder whose responsibility is this? If you want to be well known and if you want to communicate with the audience, I mean you can’t alter the journalist, the only thing you can alter is the scientist maybe, yourself.
Stanley B. Prusiner: Right, who are we talking about, the minister or myself?
Who is to blame if the communication doesn’t work, the journalists or the scientists?
… it still is the responsibility of the scientist to try to communicate better with the public …
Stanley B. Prusiner: The scientists. I think that the scientists have to constantly try to translate what they do into language that most people can understand and we are never going to be in a position where everyone is a knowledgeable layman, meaning they have a great scientific background because whatever they learn in a university setting is already obsolete the day they graduate. So the best we can do is hope we can train them in some introductory science courses to give them a little background, but after that, it still is the responsibility of the scientist to try to communicate better with the public and this is very, very hard to do, because each year, science becomes more complicated, there’s more and more specialised vocabulary. One of the things we don’t have as scientists is we don’t have a lot of people around who understand the details of the science intimately who are interested in translating it for the public.";565;Creativity
Because this central idea when we were talking about communication is that we talk about public understanding of science but as you phrase it now, that is not very easy to do, so maybe you should turn the thing around, it’s science understanding a public that is more interesting.;The science is understanding the public or making the scientists making science more understandable for the public.;565;Creativity
Yes, but also to understand how the public thinks and feels and what their values are, to be able to phrase their science in a framework where people can understand it.;"I think that’s very legitimate, I’m not sure how practical that is in terms of making that happen.
Do you want to try it?
Stanley B. Prusiner: I can try. Whatever you’d like to talk about, I’ll try to …
No, that in a way would be to make science as a part of culture.
Stanley B. Prusiner: I think that’s wonderful but the problem is, where do we start? How do we get this moving and it’s extremely difficult? I mean you would hope that, for instance, the web would be a great place to do this. The Internet is ideal in many respects. The problem with the Internet is there’s so much material on the Internet, it’s uncensored, it’s unreviewed, so for the person who doesn’t have a lot of knowledge, they now Google themselves into some website and all of a sudden they’re confronted with material that they can’t judge whether this material is legitimate, whether it’s reasonable, whether it fits with the scientific data or it’s some wacko person’s ideas about a disease or some physical process. You know, it’s very, very hard for people to judge this.
… you can find all kinds of material, much of which is unsupported by any scientific data …
I’ll give you an example in the field of mad cow disease. You can go into the Internet and look up mad cow disease and you can find all kinds of material, much of which is unsupported by any scientific data. And there are a lot of people out there interested in this because this is a huge economic issue and it’s a huge health issue and yet there’s an enormous amount of information which is available that comes from peer reviewed scientific studies and yet, if you don’t have a reasonable working knowledge, you’ll be confused when you get into this. So it’s very, very hard I think to put science out there for the public and we need to figure out how to do this. It’s not a given, in fact we do it very poorly.
But there’s a big challenge to your colleagues and for the scientific community.
Stanley B. Prusiner: I think the challenge is huge and I must say that I don’t know how to do this. I find it very difficult to identify people who are very interested in doing this. In other words, someone who has a very good working knowledge of science who can really judge and we’re not talking about all science now, we’re saying okay, someone who perhaps is very good in the field of neuroscience and neurological diseases and then finding such a person who wants to devote his or her life to making this available to the public.";565;Creativity
Finally, what would your perspective be for the scientific community or for the society as a whole if you doesn’t succeed in communicating science?;"I think that there are huge problems for society if scientists can’t communicate their science. It’s so important. Number one, funding for scientific research depends upon public support. I think that policymakers, legislators, they need to be informed and they need to be informed in terms that they can understand, not that we want them to understand, that’s number one. Secondly, I think as our planet grows more crowded, people need the information in order to make decisions that benefit others on our planet and third, if we don’t communicate science, we won’t see the science turned into technologic advantages for our civilisation.
So scientists have a huge responsibility, they’re not very good at doing this and at the same time, it’s not fair to put all the burden on them because that’s not what they want to do, that’s not the job they’ve signed up for, they’ve signed up very often to roll back the frontiers of knowledge. So we need people in between, the people gathering the knowledge, the people consuming the knowledge, we need people in between to translate and my guess is that we’re going to need to create such a discipline for our society which our society meaning civilisation on this planet, which each year grows more and more dependent upon high technology.
So, to finish, let’s hope that the audience is googling around on Google to this interview and to share the ideas and the thoughts. Thank you very much for giving us your time.
Stanley B. Prusiner: Thank you.";565;Creativity
Rolf Zinkernagel, welcome to this interview. You were the co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Peter Doherty. I’d like to start by exploring a few general themes. If I say the word mentorship, what does that conjure up for you?;I get the whole process of being taught and educated in whatever field. For me it’s medicine and biology. And as always is the case, you have a few key figures on your way into a certain area and I think that applies to everybody. In my case, teachers in Switzerland like Jean Lindenmann who discovered Interferon, together with [Alick] Isaacs, a long time ago, 50 years in fact this year. Then Henry Isliker, a complement researcher in Lausanne, played a major role. Then in Canberra, I’d say Bob Blanden, Gordon Ada, Frank Fenner would be amongst them. And in the US, Frank Dixon would be one of these persons.;567;Mentors(Role Models)
And is there anything that you particularly carry over from them in your mentorship of people?;"Yes, for example we always used what we call the Bible Allah in our teaching for post docs and doctoral students in Zurich. And this is an idea I took over from two persons, one at the Basel University where I grew up, his name is Adolph Portmann, he is a human physiologist in the broader sense. And he had a course which I attended during medical school which was called Classical papers in zoology and biology. We read classical papers of Lamarque or Darwin and so on, and he put that into connection of time. And Gordon Ada had a similar project where we went through certain papers in immunology, and I sort of combined this and taught a class every two or three years about very important papers over the first 100 or 120 years of immunology.
Incredibly useful but quite a rare thing to do now I imagine.
Rolf Zinkernagel: I guess so because Medline stops I think at, for most things now, at about 1970 or 1965. And many of these older types of studies have been incredibly ingenious.
So that’s primarily what you’re teaching. You’re teaching ingenuity through …
Rolf Zinkernagel: Through that course, yes absolutely. And just for youngsters getting a perspective of that immunology didn’t start in 1997; it started much, much earlier. And I think this is true for most areas of medicine and biology. And I think it’s good to get a sort of perspective of both history, but also to make us all more humble because other people have been probably much more clever than we have.";567;Mentors (Role models)
When you choose students to come and work with you, what do you look for in the student?;"We look mostly for performance, are they good? And the second is we always have them visit at least twice the lab to talk with people. And thirdly, we ask their mentors or whoever knows about them personally.
So having them visit the lab is a way of finding out whether they’ll fit in.
Rolf Zinkernagel: Correct. And I think particularly in a relatively small lab like ours, I think the personalities and characters are usually the limiting factors. It’s not the brains.";567;Competencies
That leads me onto the next question I was going to ask you, what sort of lab environment do you like to create?;What we have done over the past 30 years, and this is also largely influenced by my experience in Lausanne at the Biochemistry and Henry Isliker’s lab, but also in Canberra. There you have a very open, flat hierarchical type of structure, where the only thing that really counts is what your competence is and how good you are, and how intelligent in combining things together, advising people, and have them accept you as a character.;567;Environment
As well as having an open communication, do you also have an open lab structure? Do you have people working together next door to each other, bumping into each other?;"Absolutely. We have this in Zurich, but this basically has been my experience in all other places I’ve been. You’re very much limited in space. People cannot avoid bumping into each other. I think that also makes the priority clear that they have to fit somehow, otherwise this is not possible to be living together on the very small amount of space.
I’ve sometimes wondered whether some of the problems of the drug industry might be put down to the fact they have too much money when they build their labs and they create too much space between people.
Rolf Zinkernagel: I don’t think this is the problem really. I think their problem is more that they are under a certain pressure to deliver. I think that’s one problem. The other problem is that, and this is a positive problem, what you say, you have more money available once you are on the subject of interest to the company. But the disadvantage, nothing is black and white, so I think the cost point is that if the company or the firm decides after three years that’s not going to gel out and you have to change your subject, that’s very difficult because you have invested a lot of time in developing your baby. And then suddenly you have to jump from x to y. And I think you can do that once, maybe twice, but the third time it already gets at your very innermost desires. And I think that is, with time, a huge problem.";567;Environment
You say that the pressure to deliver is a problem in the industry. Why do you think that that pressure to produce is …?;It’s very simple. If the industry or the company cannot develop products that deliver the goods, that are active and relieve certain symptoms or disease, improve certain disease states, then the company’s out. This is very much Darwinian type of evolution.;567;Role of Science
But the pressure to deliver could have a positive effect on the people who are actually doing it?;It always has. But it’s just more drastic. In academia, if you don’t deliver next year, you are usually given a chance to come up with the goods two or three years later, because you’re granting period is usually 3-5 years. Or the university backs you up for a certain period. I think that’s a big difference to industry.;567;Creativity
Turning to your own development, you took some time to decide what you wanted to be when you were young, I gather from your autobiography. And eventually settled on medicine initially, how did that path come about?;"My choices were pre-history, ethnology, chemistry, organic chemistry or medicine. It’s difficult really to rationalise why, but I just had to make up my mind at some time. And I think this is probably true for everybody and is also true for a scientist’s life because every day you have many more questions than you can attack or solve. So you have to reduce your choices. I think that’s what I did.
But a lot of people say that it’s important to capture scientists when they’re in their early teens, you have to get them young and there needs to be a huge focus on education at that point. But for you, there were lots of things going on.
Rolf Zinkernagel: That’s right, maybe too many. Then to make choices is more difficult. But I have no regrets. I think the choices were ok.";567;Motivation
It seems that quite an important event was attending the experimental medicine course in Zurich, which was 40 years ago or so almost, and that seems to be quite precocious in a way because now experimental medicine is much talked of and people are really investing in it. For Zurich to have a department of experimental medicine at that point seems to be ahead of its time.;It was quite unique actually and what happened at the time, during the 1960s, was that a reasonable number of young Swiss spent their post-doc time in the US or in England or somewhere else. And came back home developing new departments. That was the time when science and science endeavours had only upsides and everything went up. And at that time, it became apparent that, and this is a general trend I think it applies to the US and the UK, that the number of MDs, of doctors actually choosing to do clinical research or basic research dwindled. And this had of course many reasons, amongst them I guess the bread baskets hanging lower or higher. That there was perhaps not quite the open culture in clinical medicine as let’s say in the Anglo-Saxon countries. So that was basically what a group of physicians tried to change and they created the course. I think the first course was about in 1967 or so. And a number of very good people actually, because it was highly selective from all of Switzerland only 10 people could attend the course per year. You got a reasonable bunch of youngsters and it was very good.;567;Environment
Would it be fair to say that it turned you towards basic research from medicine or were you already heading that way which is why you joined the course?;I was still seeking or looking for something because initially I wanted to become a surgeon, which I thought was the most honest way to practice medicine. But somehow this didn’t really preoccupy my mind, so I was looking around, then just got onto that course and from there things went in a bended way, but still relatively straight forward for the next 40 years.;567;Motivation
What focused you on immunology? You quite quickly found that was your path.;Infectious disease is still I think the biggest problem in medicine. To relate infectious disease, to understand host/infectious agent relationships and so on, was in a way logical for an MD.;567;Creativity
And your second post-doc was in Canberra where you found yourself at the Australian National University. And working with Peter Doherty you had very rapid results and came up with MHC restriction as an idea within a year of joining together.;Even less. This I think is a good example how chance really operates because the original plan was not to work with Peter but to work with Bob Blanden on the faculties of intracellular bacteria, such as listeria or salmonella or TB. And then the lab sizes at the ANU in micro are very small. In each so-called lab there actually were two heads and one pair of hands. And the heads could be PhD students or post-docs or a professor and the technician basically. And the only open space in the whole floor was actually in Peter Doherty’s lab. So I started doing some experiments with Bob Blanden, but by co-infiltration and co-adaptation, we started to simply work on a problem he was interested in, which was at the time information in the brain. And I came from an institution where so-called cytotoxicity, I say is namely that T-lymphocytes or cell mediated immune effected cells were measured by their capacity to liaise or destroy in-vitro cultured cells with some abnormalities or additions. And since I had learned that test in Lausanne that fitted nicely to the problem of information in the brain. And then we started to combine our expertise and that was the beginning of the end.;567;Creativity
In your banquet speech at the Nobel ceremony you talked about the combination of Peter the mystic and Rolf the collector. It was obviously a great combination of talents and complementarity, what was special about that relationship?;"I think that the most important part is really that Peter and I had a very similar sense of humour which was very good. And in terms of character, him being a vet, myself being an MD, I think we had complementary types of views on certain things and doing certain things and thinking about things. You cannot plan these things they just happen or don’t happen. We got along extremely well. And I think very important if you work in two’s or three’s, I think we both had an extremely open discussional relationship which meant at the end none of us were afraid of the other. In contrast we really had a very easy relationship.
Open and giving – no secrets.
Rolf Zinkernagel: Yes.";567;Creativity
As the mechanism was worked out did the applicability of the discovery become much broader as well? Was it realised that it could be of much more benefit if you like?;"Yes and no, like always. I think the detailed understanding is very satisfying because if you understand something, but the practicability, the hope was that once we understood everything, we could just take peptides, which are sort of localised in this presenting molecule and immunise easily and tumours and all sorts of things, and that hasn’t happened. It’s the biology at the end of the day that shows where the limitations are and in a way I find this very satisfying being an MD, a physiologist basically, that physiology counts. That understanding counts as well of course, it’s very important and satisfying. But to have function and improve disease states or prevent death is usually much more complicated than see the molecule.
You need to see the basic mechanism operating within the system.
Rolf M. Zinkernagel: You need both.";567;Creativity
We’re here at the Lindau meeting where Nobel Laureates mix with a large number of students and your lecture here was entitled ‘Why don’t we yet have a vaccine against TB or HIV?’ So we seem to have found our way into that question. What answer did you provide to the students;"Despite the fact that we know all these details, where T-cells recognise how cell mediating immunity functions, how it’s getting triggered, theoretically you would have thought, put things together, express things, make the molecules, should go. It doesn’t. And I think what I try to do is to show some commonalities between the problems we have solved like the acute childhood infections, what they have in common, versus all the infections where we haven’t succeeded in making a vaccine. What are their commonalities? And to put it in very simple terms, the commonality is that for the acute /- – -/ killing types of infections, the only thing you need is a high enough antibody level, because in a way evolution has chosen that pathway as a successful pathway because the mother can give these antibodies to you when you are born. Whereas the other group of infections, including malaria, schistosomiasis, TB, leprosy, HIV and …
Which come later in life, yes?
Rolf Zinkernagel: No they don’t come in fact, they also come very early. But in most of these cases it’s not sufficient to have just maternal antibodies. You need an excellent immune response that actually keeps on being driven by low level infection that you cannot get rid of. And I think that part, namely to have a vaccine that imitates, starts a very low level of infection, to actually maintain and boost the immune response all the time. That is what we haven’t succeeded. Take TB, there is a so-called vaccine against TB, it’s called BCG, the bug that has been selected and developed at Pasteur in the 1920’s. Now interestingly, BCG can reduce the chances of very small kids, between 0-2 years, to catch what is called an overwhelming type of TB infection. But it cannot change TB disease after that period of time. And this correlates virtually to the month with the persistence of the BCG bug in the small kid, because the BCG is so much attenuated that after one or maximum of two years, the bacterium has been eliminated from the host. And once that has happened protection decays, is finished. And I use this example to explain that in my view, and this is not a popular view, that what we call memory, immunological memory, that is having seen an antigen or infection once, protects you for the rest of life, is not true. It’s an academic idea which is nice and interesting but doesn’t correlate with the experience we have in clinical medicine.
Although it’s the basis for all vaccination programmes, is it not?
Rolf Zinkernagel: Yes, but you see the key point is that for all the cases where the classical vaccines protect and work, the only thing you need to have is a high enough antibody level. If that is fulfilled, and there are many ways to fulfil that, then you are ok. But in all other cases where you apparently cannot inject something and then be protected for the next 40 years of your life, there is no reasonable explanation.
So what’s the approach?
Rolf Zinkernagel: It’s in a way to create infectious agents that fulfil the requirement of persistence without causing disease.
So sufficiently stimulating throughout.
Rolf Zinkernagel: Correct. For many, many years. But the experience just shows that evolution or co-evolution between let’s say TB or leprosy or malaria, has done an excellent job. Because over many, many years, millions probably, the adaptation has reached such an elegance and minimal entropy level that you virtually cannot improve. Or you have to be extremely optimistic to think you can do better. But it’s not impossible. But it’s just very difficult.
As well as theorising about it are you working on this precise problem?
Rolf Zinkernagel: Yes, we try. We follow certain possibilities, for example, in the virus we use which is called lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, LCMV, in mice, it has exactly those characteristics. Usually, it’s controlled very well in mice, but then persists at a very low level and keeps up the immune response. We’ve found an unexpected way how virus actually seem, this is an RNA virus, but isn’t a so-called rhetoral virus. It’s not like HIV, nevertheless we find in mice footprints of this virus, but not in RNA form. We also found RNA’s of the virus. But in some cases we find a DNA form of certain viral antigens, which is completely unexpected. So we now try to understand what is going on. And the interesting part of that is that LCMV is highly adapted, like in a way HIV to higher primates is highly adapted to the mouse. HIV in the mouse is completely different from HIV in a rat. And rats and mice are fairly close. And in rats this does not happen. In rats the virus cannot create DNA, in mice it can. It must be highly species specific.
So the problem you’re really battling is co-evolution of …
Rolf Zinkernagel: Yes, in a way. Because at the end of the day both have to survive. And the virus is not interested in killing the host.
You returned to the ETH …
Rolf Zinkernagel: I am actually at the university.";567;Creativity
You returned to the university in 1979 and have been there ever since. It obviously provides an environment that suits you well. Is there anything special about it?;"I guess it’s a combination of many factors. Both my wife and myself come from Basel, which is about 50 miles away from Zurich. Our kids basically grew up in Canberra, in La Jolla for five years and have now grown up in Zurich, we feel very comfortable. It’s a very interesting, culturally rich university life, small city, it only has about 400,000 inhabitants. But you have two excellent universities. So if you can’t solve or attack a problem, you find somebody to do it with you or for you. So it’s a very good environment. But I think La Jolla was an excellent environment, Canberra …
Wherever you can do good work.
Rolf Zinkernagel: Yes, in a way.";567;Environment
In parallel to your research work you’ve become, especially in recent years, quite a spokesperson for the animal experimentation movement. And also, you’ve spoken out in favour of gene technology. What do you think needs to be done from the research community’s point of view for those causes?;"I think there are two major aspects. One is the media, the public opinion side and the other is the research side. I think researchers have to make all reasonable efforts to report and talk about what they do and how they do it. I think some people do that fairly well and others have an intellectual arrogance that is not very conducing to these efforts. So, on the other side you have the media and it’s not a secret, I think this is a worldwide phenomenon that the of course media in very general terms, there are exceptions, but are leaning towards a red/green type of tingeing of their glasses. So basically because of the atom bomb, physics and chemistry is very bad for you because of infections. Science is bad because of … 
Chemicals can’t be good etc.
Rolf Zinkernagel: But this of course is over simplified and is not correct in this, but it’s a brave form of formulating the concerns. So, I think that’s one part, and the other part is to report on scandals in science is very attractive to the media, because I think that’s the major justification for media. And the second part is that to report that science is very hard work, very difficult, requires an enormous dedication because in fact 99% of the experiments go down the drain and are unsuccessful. The media are not interested in all that part. They simply pick the few raisons or cherries out of the cake that are enormous. And some of these picked cherries turn out to be rotten cherries. This gives a very strange atmosphere. But I think the sports is the same. As long as somebody jumps eight metres he’s ok, but if he’s doping, of course he is not ok. So I think the same happens with science. And this makes the business very difficult because the third aspect is I think as scientists we must not create hopes that are unjustified. Because that is very dangerous. And I think that happens too often.
Yes, there’s a lot of claim of potential cure.
Rolf Zinkernagel: And this has happened with HIV vaccines for example for many years. And I think we should be much more careful. But then I think we need the honest cooperation of the media because I think it’s, in a way, as much in the interests of the media to make a big splash about some hope. We need some co-evolution I’d guess.";567;Role of Science
Professor Nüsslein-Volhard, it’s so nice to have you here in Lindau. What you said today, that scientists have to be humble, could you explain that a little bit more?;"Yes. The importance of genes was of course recognised very early on and I think the term gene was coined about 100 years ago and I knew they were sort of carrying the information from which determining living organisms. Then people set out with the human genome project to decipher all the genes in humans and they had the vision, I think, that when they had deciphered them, they would know a lot more about humans than they knew before and the written out genome would tell them everything about humans.
This is a pretty naïve view and there are rather a large number of surprises which came out after the whole genome project was done and one was, for example, that the number of genes was much smaller than the number of say phenotypes or traits which you can see features of an organism of a human being, if a lot of features you can write out, I mean enormously large numbers of features and it’s impossible that for each feature you have a specific gene. Actually this is a notion that you don’t have a one to one correlation between affinity, big feature and a gene, that is a notion also geneticists know and geneticists have phrase for example, Thomas Hunt Morgan, Nobel Laureate I think 1930 or so, he did sort of say that in his lecture and for fly geneticists it’s obviously that there are many more than one gene determining the eye colour for example of a fly and if you look at a wing, there are many genes which determine the wing.
… analysing a gene or diagnosing a particular gene doesn’t really tell you everything …
On the other hand, what we also observe in studying genetics or developmental genetics in flies or fishes also, when you have one particular gene and you hit it, then you have effects on many more than one trait and in the display of the human genome, it’s very clear that the 35,000 genes or so can also only function this way, namely that you have a complex interaction, a complex relationship between features and gene and this means also that in analysing a gene or diagnosing a particular gene doesn’t really tell you everything about what the human being would look like and this is something people had expected, that they would be able to predict and then they thought, I know the gene, I can take it in or out and this is what I mean with more humble.";569;Advice for young researchers
What does it actually mean for example to the general public? There has been a lot of talks about gene testing and by doing that we could prevent people from getting sick and so on, but it seems like that is not actually applicable?;"In some cases yes, I mean there are some various genes with simple causes, namely just one mutation and these are rare cases but these are the inherited diseases, monogenic inherited diseases, and this is actually true when you diagnose it. You know that this person, if the gene is defective in both copies, then you know you can predict with 100% certainty this child will be ill, and this type of diagnosis is of course valuable when it’s done, but the other type of predictions do not hold true because, as I said, traits depend on many genes and a gene has different effects on. So there are many diseases which are probably where you have a predisposition with a particular genetic background that you might get it more frequently than other people might get some diseases but it’s never totally predictable and this is why the diagnosis doesn’t really help you much.
I mean it doesn’t really help you to be told by your diagnosis that you have a 5% higher chance to develop a certain type of cancer, this you don’t need to know that and it’s like, if you eat Birchermüesli every breakfast, you might acquire some strange disease with 5% more frequency than something else, I mean so your daily habits are as or more important than your … well it’s tough, it’s really something which is sort of difficult to say with uncertainty, but in many respects, the daily habits are more influential of your disease pattern than your genes, your genetic background.";569;CPS
So the risks, we’re not talking about one in certain groups of people are talking about, you can’t see when it’s going to be misused in a certain way?;"I don’t think it’s misused yet, people are afraid of it might be misused but on the other hand, there is also value in finding out about the relation between several particular predispositions. You might be more careful if you are told that your genetic background is such that you shouldn’t eat fat in large amounts or so, it does help you change your life a little bit and so it’s not so bad, but it’s hard to find out which genetic background is causing these things.
And this is why we have now these genomic projects where populations are tested, the genome is analysed, a pattern of variants is sort of recorded and then their habits and their way of life is recorded, and then also their disease pattern is recorded. And then you might find a correlation between some diseases and a genetic predisposition and this is a little bit the hope now that you might find which dispositions are particularly prone for certain irregularities and this might to help people change your diet or run longer every morning or don’t run at all or something like that. But it will not have a big effect, it will not have a big effect and it will be so uncertain that it might not be widely used perhaps.";569;Roles of Science (Scientists)
With your scientific work, I think there are a lot of students who need role models and I would say a lot of female students need role models as well, we don’t see as many female students, I mean scientists, yet. Do you think there is a way to encourage more female scientists?;In Germany it’s very clear what you could do and the thing is you have to have better schools, you have to have day schools and you have to educate the people, having someone else educate your child is often better for the child than you do it yourself, but this is not generally accepted in Germany. So many women just are sort of torn between the two things, they want to do the best for their children and they want to do a good job, but I think there is still a distrust that if you let your child be brought up by a day Mother or in a day care, that it might not be as good for the child as you wish and this is also perhaps in many cases true, because there is not a large culture of day cares in Germany, in contrast to the Scandinavian countries I think. There it is clear from looking at the results now that for the children it’s as good or even better if they are with other children and they are educated by a professional. For women in Germany, the big problem is they usually tend to interrupt and they are slowed down in their progress and they can’t compete as much as they should with men who don’t have to do that.;569;Diversity in Science
If you look for example at a female athlete or sports people, I mean they are more celebrated and honoured and they get funding from companies and so on. Will there be such a way to sort of move forward and make science a little bit more popular?;Yes, this is another thing. It was this morning, the speeches by the politicians were quite telling. I mean if children are mocked because they’re good at school, you can see why female scientists especially who are successful, do not have a better standing. On the other hand, I mean, people suspect that they might not be good mothers or they might not be good people, so it’s not attractive socially from the society, it’s not really attractive to be a successful female scientist, so I sometimes think, why should I talk young women into being a scientist if they then end up being sort of disliked or not accepted by their contemporaries and so it’s a tricky business actually.;569;Diversity in Science
What drove you into science?;"I think a very big curiosity. I’m very curious and I like to understand things and not only science but also other things where I just try to find out why things work or how things work. Science and nature caught my attention as a small child already. I was growing up in a city but we had a garden and I loved the garden and then often on vacation I was at a farm and I loved these animals and plants and so on, so I was attracted very early on and then we had a very good teaching actually at my … I don’t know whether my teachers really had much of a role because I was determined very early, but then I also did music and I did languages and Literature and so on. I have broad interests actually other than science, but this is really true, this curiosity.
Yes, so I mean just to solve problems, to express yourself?
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard: To find out, yes I’m a curious reader too, yes I want to understand things, yes.";569;Motivation
I would like to come back to that just now but I was thinking of, after the Nobel Prize, did life change in any way in the sense that you could take bigger risks in your scientific work or were allowed, so to speak, from the surroundings to?;"Not really. I thought that getting the Nobel Prize was a big interruption in my career, I thought and it was very distracting. It takes a lot of time you know, it just takes time to be honoured, you have to travel and you have to give speeches of things you have, oh it’s so often that you get bored to tears when you hear your own voice. And it’s really taking a lot of your time and there’s no way that during this time you can start something new, I mean you just profit from what you’ve done and there is no time to develop new ideas.
I suffered a little bit during this time, I really thought that must end and I now stop a bit, you know shield myself a bit more from this type of redundancy because you have to have leisure to develop ideas, this is absolutely important and this is something I find people do not realise enough. Also scientists are very ambitious, they work and work and work and they go to the lab and they write this and they write that and they run from conference to conference and I sometimes wonder when they have time to have a new idea.
… creativity can only come on an empty mind …
I think sometimes they just work on old ideas and creativity can only come on an empty mind, but somehow there must be some wandering around: oh what could I do now and hey, let’s think about this or s. But if you’re always are occupied with travelling or with having to do something, so someone else tells you what to do, you are the programme, you can’t really develop original thoughts and so this is why I now sort of take my time. I take time off and I take long weekends and I stay home and I think and write and read and this is really quite fun.
… and sing, I believe?
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard: I sing yes sure and I garden, I have a large garden and I really recreate myself by doing gardening and thinking about something else so that when your mind gets free from all the burden of the daily troubles and then you can start putting something fresh in, you know.";569;Impact of Nobel prize on you
So is that the link between science and art for you or culture?;Yes I mean, I have a strong likeness of culture and also I mean my grandmother was a painter and we do music in the family quite a lot and I think that’s very important. What was also important, I thought about that recently, also maybe as a follow-up of an interview but I was asked what my parents did and so on and looking at my brothers and sisters, we had a wonderful education because my parents were so practical, they did books themselves and we did a lot of handicrafts and I knew how to knit and sew and cook and we learnt a lot to do things ourselves, to make things ourselves so we all have some dexterity in doing things ourselves and this is also very important for Science, because you could quickly see how things would work and organise something, make it work, yes.;569;Creativity
I was thinking about what you said of being able to get new ideas and thoughts and create something that has not been created before. You changed from the fruit fly to the zebra fish and I read in some of the articles that people were saying, yes that’s outrageous and you can’t do that and you know, are people very conservative and do you have to fight to be able to, you know, new challenges?;"If you look at the career paths of many scientists, they tend to start with something and just go on and on and on and on and on and they would not change topic because they always think there is something else to do, which is true, they follow a predetermined path. Whenever you have a problem there is another problem coming up, you can always go on and I changed dramatically after my thesis work when I went from bacterial transcription by chemistry to fruit flies. This was a wonderful challenge because it was all new and it really challenges you to think freshly about things. I think that was the most creative time of my life and it was great fun and I also experienced at that time that I, compared to other people working in this field, I came up with ideas. They were blocked in their minds to do this because they thought, oh this is not done, we don’t do that in our field and you can’t do that, and I said: Why not?
And then I did things which were completely unconventional and it helps changing fields because you can be unconventional for some time. Later on you are again bound in all this. This is how it’s done and you can’t really change very much. In the fish I think I didn’t really change that dramatically, I just changed the animal but not the question and changing the animal of course was a big challenge too and it was fun for me to develop the tools to do what we had done with flies, also with fish and it took a long time actually and we had some years without success.
We had success but without sort of products and publications and so on and you have to be able to afford that and I’m lucky I’m in this Max Planck society where this is essentially encouraged that you start something new, do some risky projects without having to fear that you lose your funding, so we can do that and one should do that and should encourage people to do that, but some think they can’t afford it because they might have a gap in their track record in the publications and then they won’t do it.
… and funding, yes.
… funding policy should be such that people can run risks …
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard: Yes. So, on the other hand you can also say that funding policy should be such that people can run risks and if they have done something. I think, when I started with fish I was pretty well known, I had been successful and people sort of entrusted, the Max Planck Society at least, they said okay, she’s done fine, she’s not stupid and why not support that and let her do something new and I think that’s perfectly okay, but maybe in the United States, I wouldn’t have gotten the funding because they immediately want you to, the next half year already to write another paper or show that you’ve done something when it’s not yet time.";569;Research
What is the greatest challenge at the moment for you on a professional level?;"At the moment I have changed the way my lab is run and I think, more and more I just provide the atmosphere for young groups to do their own projects and I do the coordination. I listen to them and I help them and I challenge them with stupid questions or smart questions or with criticism or so. But it’s less and less my own ideas which are done and this is because I have a great interest now also in history of science and also in teaching, not teaching in schools, but I’m writing a book and I’m also on ethical councils and I’m thinking a lot about what people should know and develop in biology and in genetics and how to explain it to them and so on.
So I spend much of my time now writing this book, reading other books and trying to understand things or sort of make a synthesis from things which are not from other fields. I don’t know, actually in my field, I mean if you ask what my scientific goals would be which I probably will not follow up myself but sort of appointing people who would work on these topics is evolutionary biology actually, how organisms change, making this switch would lead to a change of the species and this is a very interesting topic and in my Institute there are other groups which do similar things and we try to look at some of the mechanisms now with this viewpoint and this is very interesting actually.
It is certainly because we still yet don’t know really.
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard: No, we don’t know and actually it’s true, I said that this morning, we know the fish, we know the worm, we know the fly, but we don’t know the links between and we don’t know, when we go back to the branches in evolution, we really don’t know what happened there when they branched and how they divert and what is the major drive for evolution.
The coelacanth fish is just one of those amazing examples that intrigues me.
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard: Which?
The coelacanth, you know, I don’t know what it’s called in German, the fish with the legs which has always been one of the, yes.
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard: Aha.
I would like to say thank you but I just want to say, you talked about encouraging German students, so you become a bridge builder, don’t you, in many ways, I would say?
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard: I don’t know, I mean I can’t tell from my own viewpoint. Yes.
I can see you as a bridge builder between this and because I think it’s so easy to get into just one question, not to see the whole. Great, thank you very much for a very interesting talk. Thank you very much.
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard: Okay, thank you";569;Creativity
You seem to have almost consciously avoided the changes that can come with laureate status.;"Yes. If your life is okay, if your life is successful. I lived in the lab, I do stuff, I do experiments actively at the bench myself. At the time when I received the award I did that, I worked five or six hours a day, still at the bench. I teach, I have a family. I don’t have much more time in my life, but the way my time is spent is pretty good for me. I’m happy that way, so why would I want to change things? I was curious, I had very few active decisions, thoughtful decisions, after receiving the prize, but one of them really was this conscious choice that I would not be a Nobel Laureate, in an odd sense.
We came back from Stockholm and I didn’t know what to do with all the stuff. We went to the local bank and we never had this, but we had a little bank box thing. We rented one of those boxes with keys, a deposit box, put all that stuff in it, in 1995, and I haven’t seen it since. It’s there someplace, and I think we still have the key, God, I hope we have the key. It’s there, but … Because I like the way things were before.";570;Advice for young scientists
I imagine the prize gives a certain sense of security, and yet you didn’t need that really, I suppose, in the first place.;"I think it’s a nice thing that people recognise what you do and recognise the value of what you do. It also brings a certain power, not real power, but in the sense of a certain ability to influence or your opinions matter. Newspapers sometimes will call you up. Or if people want you to participate, if you go to a local high school science fair and you walk around and talk to people it brings them pleasure because of who you are. But …
There’s a danger in that as well.
Eric F. Wieschaus: Yes. The reality is that from a personal gratification standpoint, everyone who’s received a Nobel Prize has already has that to some degree. You don’t get a Nobel Prize out of the blue because suddenly the Swedes figure out that you did a cool experiment that nobody else has recognized. Reality is that by the time I received the award, the experiments were already highly regarded and people understood their impact and understood that they were important. I had as much recognition as any scientist would really want to have in their life. The Nobel Prize is something that’s really an important thing in my life, and it did give me security. It did give me a certain sense of position in the world that I didn’t fully appreciate, but it is a nice thing to have happened, but it would be very sad if it were a necessary part of my life. I suppose that’s what my choice was, the absolute belief that this thing was not necessary.
One hears of people who don’t receive the prize, who seem to have been concerned with the idea of winning it and that must be a burden.
Eric F. Wieschaus: Yes, that would be sad because like all things, it’s a /- – -/.
We’re sitting here on a beautiful spring day in Princeton, which has been your home for what, 28 years?
Eric F. Wieschaus: Something like that, yes.";570;How to Spend the Nobel money
Obviously it suits you. What is it about the place that’s so right?;It’s a small town, a great university, great students, wonderful opportunity to do science. I am happy with the size, the department that I’m in has maybe 35 people, 35 scientists, all of whom I respect and all of whom I interact with. We teach together, we work together. There is a strong sense of intellectual community that’s satisfying for me here. It’s an easy town to live in. I have a family, my wife is also a professor in this department. We don’t collaborate or do science together, but it’s because we’re both living in this small town, we are able to manage our lives and get things done. Get home in time to throw a dinner together for the kids, all of those things that made our earlier lives, when we were a little bit younger and in developing our careers, a lot easier just simply because we could have a family here and we could do our science in a fully committed way. And that worked out really well for us.;570;Environment
Does the smallness of the department and indeed of the small-town feel contribute to your ability to stay in science? Because one of the unusual things about you is that you still do several hours bench work a day.;I think it clearly does. If I had to commute 40 minutes from a house into the laboratory, my life would be more complicated, I wouldn’t be able to do science. When our children were at home either my wife or I would come back into the lab almost in the evening after we finally got the kids to bed, from nine to nine to one or something like that and get us an extra four hours in, because we live 5-10 minutes by bike, away from the lab. You can hop on the bike and get in and all those things make it easier. I just found it an easy place for me to figure out what it was. It was small enough that I could control it. There weren’t that many variables. At lab I have teaching. I have my university responsibilities administratively, but all those things were kind of definable. I could say, I could do this and this and this, and I could manage. If things were bigger, maybe if there were more opportunities, maybe things would’ve been different, but I felt comfortable with being able to manage things here.;570;Creativity
It’s actually quite a rare talent to be able to be able to manage the opportunities and not to get drawn away into all the administration and the kind of empire building and stuff. That must be a temptation?;"Ah, noted. No, no. I got into the business because I like doing science. I like being in the lab. I have this crazy sense that every time I’m doing an experiment it’s as exciting as the experiment that I did yesterday. I know that’s not true. I know that I’ve had great experiments and good experiments, but any experiment when I’m doing it, at the time that I’m doing it, seems like it’s going to be a great experiment. There is no attraction to me beyond, other than doing science. I like teaching actually and the reason to be good teacher, but I’m conscious of the cost because teaching means that you have to organize yourself, get up, give formal lectures for an hour and an hour and a half. It costs to do, for you to be a teacher, and that’s a different kind of cost. When I go into the lab, it’s like the totally natural thing for me to do. I plot down in front of a microscope and start sorting flies or checking expression patterns or thinking about things or designing crosses. That’s natural. It’s the only thing that I do that doesn’t take any effort at all ever.
What a blessing.
Eric F. Wieschaus: Yes, absolutely.";570;Competencies
Did it come naturally? Was that when you were growing up, were you a scientist as a child, do you think?;"Perhaps, I don’t know. You look back and you try to figure out who you were as a child. My family are not scientists, they’re not academics. I grew up in Alabama, in Birmingham in the 1950s and 1960s. I didn’t know that people could be scientists. My father worked in the steel industry and then he and my mother eventually had a construction company and they built things. I didn’t know the possibilities. I wanted to be an artist. I painted, I drew, there’s a part of my character that’s very driven towards visual things that even plays into my science heavily. I know that in part, me being an artist was the same part of me that eventually became and me becoming a scientist. Fortunate for me was that I had certain chance things. I was able to go to a summer science program when I was in high school and actually left Birmingham, Alabama and took a train to Lawrence, Kansas to the University of Kansas and lived there for a summer when I was like 16 or 17. For me, it was wonderful, that nerdy little high school kid, and then suddenly going off to Kansas and living in a dormitory with, I suppose, other nerdy little high school kids. It was suddenly a social situation that was different than the so typical social situation.
When you’re a young teenager in high school, it’s a traumatic thing, regardless of whether you’re the most popular person in the class or the least popular, or somewhere on the spectrum in between because everybody at that age is terribly insecure. You’re not the coolest kid, you want to hang around with the cool because they’re clearly cliques and all that. In high school, this period from 14 to 18 is a difficult traumatic time or difficult time, not traumatic time, but difficult time for everybody in growing up. I think one of the reasons I ended up being a scientist was that I went from that typical middle school, high school malaise, and was taken out of that situation by chance and for summer moved out to Lawrence, Kansas, and lived in a dorm with all these other kids that were equally socially maladapt, probably.
Yet there we had this … It was like a great social environment and it was actually even interesting and I did all this science and I tend to care intensely about things that I do. I think internally I have a … There must be some competitive aspect to my character in terms of wanting to do, but I don’t automatically walking into a room or walking into a classroom where I didn’t think that I was the best student there. Yet I was very trended, I was very successful there because I go in and I do everything with this kind of emotional intensity that raises my performance and my ability to get things up to a high level. Then I was invited back to for another year and that was a reinforcement that yes, you can do things.
You can do things well, and this is a socially attractive circumstance to live your … You could do this for your life and people will pay you for this. It seemed I’ll do this. Yes, absolutely.";570;Motivation
You found your clique.;Yes, of course. I can’t say that I necessarily planned to be a scientist, but I had the good fortune of having broad experiences and recognizing and being able to follow the things that I like. I was smart enough, I guess, to recognize this is something cool, this is something that matches me, this is something about who I am.;570;Creativity
Illustrates how important it is to give opportunities to people at that stage in their development. A science camp type thing.;Absolutely. And it’s opportunities out of their normal life. You grow up with certain expectations and you grow up with an understanding of the world that is always limited in some sense. Being able to leave home, go someplace else, see other things, make other choices. I think it’s hard for me to say growing up in Alabama at that time, it’s probably special in itself but I think it would be true regardless of where you grew up that if you grew up in New York City, your experiences are still going to be limited regardless of where you are as a child. The opportunity to go away and do something kind of semi on your own, but in a somewhat protected environment is a great thing.;570;Advice  for young scientists
One sort of boundary you crossed was to move across to the East coast to do graduate work, and you chose Yale. Was that an easy choice?;"This was 1969. I only applied to two places, to Yale and Harvard and this was because it was 1960, this was in the middle of Vietnam war and I was, I guess, politically active or semi politically active. This was in the anti-war movement. In Notre Dame, which is the university which I was at at the time, the movement had started pretty much on the two coasts. It was beginning to go in on my campus and the opportunities that I had as an undergraduate were to be politically active. I wasn’t really involved in the truly exciting things that were happening, and so when I went out to interview at the two places, Harvard and Yale, I got to Yale and met with many professors and talked with these people and it all seemed very exciting. It was like science and I could do this. It would be like graduate school and this would be exciting.
I took the bus from New Haven, which is where Yale is up to, to Boston. The day that I was in New Haven, the undergraduates at Harvard had taken over the university and the whole university had closed down. I arrived at Harvard for my interviews and they’d all been cancelled, and there was nobody in the biology department except for one young professor, so I actually spent that day with him. We walked around and saw the … and participated in some of the demonstrations, they were all very exciting. Then I laughed and I thought this Harvard must be an exciting place to be.
But then I have this side to my character where I … Harvard is exciting, but if I’m going to do science, I should probably go to Yale, and so I picked over Harvard. Next year of course the demonstrations were all at Yale, so it turned out to a great choice because I would’ve missed the demonstrations at Harvard anyways. Whereas the following year, 1970, was the big year for demonstrations in New Haven. I was there for that, but I didn’t miss anything. It was a good choice, many fortunate things throughout my life.";570;Creativity
How about your choice of your research question? Because you found this area of embryogenesis, pathing of embryogenesis in flies, as a graduate student and have kept that question throughout your whole career. Which in a way is very fortunate, to have found a question that occupies you so well.;"I suppose the really cool thing if you’d say what would you like to recommend. If you could recommend stuff to young students it’s really good if you find something that really fascinates you and it’s really hard. Because if it were really fascinating, and it was hard, you might solve it and then you’d have to find something else. Whereas for me, because the whole issue of embryonic development and pattern information and morphogenesis and form is so complex and operates at so many different levels, that the moment you decide for me, it was a decision looking at embryos that I knew that I wanted to understand. The process: how it is that a fertilized egg, single cell that looks simple can divide into many cells and then reshape itself into something as complex as our bodies is a process that … You can watch it, you can see it and if you watch it, you can’t help but be fascinated by it.
Can’t help to say, this is what I want to understand. What’s true is that you can understand it at a whole variety of different levels. In the famous experiments, the Nobel experiments, those are largely directed at trying to get entry points into the whole process of embryonic development by identifying genes that play specific roles at specific times at specific events, genes that are required for certain cells to do certain things at certain times. The idea of those experiments, if you knew all the genes, you could make a map or a logical scheme in a way for how the process occurs. But I think it’s still true that those genetic experiments that identify genes, they give you a map, but they don’t really explain things. They give you a strategy for understanding things and processes, but that’s all that it is. What you need, there’s still all these other levels where you use your previous experiments, you use those genes, you use your previous observations to build a better understanding of a biophysical understanding or a cell biological or biochemical understanding. But it all grows out from that map.";570;Motivation
On this idea of being fortunate enough to choose a hard question that’s intriguing, there’s a talent involved in finding the entry point, in finding something. That allows you to access the question at all. The example that you raised with the Nobel Prize awarded work was a good one because there you undertook an experiment which was seemingly well, possibly impossible at the time, but certainly there was no guarantee that you were going to get the result you looked for, which was classes of genes that would control segmentation. So there’s a bravery and talent involved in choosing the right question.;"Yes. I suppose it’s brave. Some people have called it brave and other people describe the experiment in ways that are different than the way that you see it yourself. I don’t waste time. It matters to me when I do things in the lab that they work and part of that is an ability to judge. Not only what’s interesting, but what’s interesting and what’s doable right now. What can I do right now? What’s the opportunity to maybe push forward a little bit on a problem to see this is something that is doable at this moment. I’ve come to realize that is something that drives me, the practical aspect of success, of doing successful experiments, more than the big question. This is a hard thing to parse out, but you could imagine, and I know there may be scientists who see and are driven by the big question and see things in terms of big questions. I’d like to believe that I have a little bit of that myself, but I don’t. I think probably I don’t, I probably don’t have it. That’s not my strongest suit. Maybe I bring some vague sense of big questions with me wherever I go. But my strongest suit, I think, as a scientist is being able to walk into a lab and see a novel or unexpected way of doing something or solving a problem, or being able to go in and say, this may seem hard to do, or this may seem convoluted, or this may seem chance, or this may seem brave, but I can do. And that’s a trivial I can. The questions here, and if I can measure this and get this thing done, I will learn something and something that’s really cool and interesting. My whole scientific career in part has always been driven by this sense of I can go into the lab and do something and produce something. I suppose, why I’ve never wanted to have a big lab. I never had a big enough vision to manage an army of postdocs and graduate students to solve something, to push forward, for the frontiers of knowledge, for that lack of vision, if you will.
Because what I like doing is going in and doing things myself, or working closely with people, a small number of students or postdocs in my lab to solve some problem, do something that no one’s ever done before. Bring level of understanding to a new level. I like the idea and this isn’t always true, but it’s substantially true that most of the papers, virtually all the papers that come from my lab, have parts in them that I’ve done. They can be small parts, they can be trivial parts. I’ll do anything to push an experiment for all amount, hand section 500 embryos. If I have to, for five afternoons in a row, the most boring part of an experiment, I won’t do the necessarily do the analysis myself, but if I can leap in and say, This is doable, we can push things forward, I’ll do this part right now. I feel comfortable with that way of being a scientist.";570;Motivation
It’s a true collaboration between you and your students, then, you really working.;Yes. They never do what I want anyway. You might as well, kind of join, best to join forces. Sometimes when you ride these airplanes they have these little magazines and there’s little business management courses. I think, someone could explain to me how to run this operation in a more efficient way, that’d be cool.;570;Creativity
On the top of collaboration, your work with Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard was obviously a wonderful sort of symbiotic relationship. What was it that the two of you brought to this? Are you just extremely similar or did you have differing skills?;"I think we’re very in certain respects, we’re very similar. We’re both ambitious. We’re both somewhat self-contained in that we like and evaluate our success heavily by our own appraisal of what it is that we do. It matters to us. Each of us, it matters to us a lot. It matters to everybody what the world thinks and we’re social people in the world. Not totally, but we both have an internal standard for the quality of our work and a sense of gratification that the most important thing is to meet our own standards and to be happy when we’re happy with our experiments. Both intensely interested in science. She’s also visually oriented, so we both have certain common tools and strategies. For example, a lot of the immunogenetics experiments that we did in Heidelberg involve not only breeding thousands and hundreds, lots of fly stocks and collecting embryos, but a lot of it depended on our looking at them, and that we both took pleasure. We both take pleasure in beauty.
There’s this lovely picture of the two of you looking down the same microscope.
Eric F. Wieschaus: Exactly. I look at that picture and I see two things. One, that’s certainly true that we were both looking at embryos and enjoying the looking at the embryos. But the other thing, my memory of those times is we’re also competitive in the sense. The reality is that we had set up in any given time, thousands of inbred lines we were collecting embryos from, we work all through the morning trying to identify which stocks were appropriate to make microscopic slides up for examining the embryos. We prepared those and then in the evening, or the next morning, we would have a box or stacks of slides with embryos from each individual, fly embryos from individual mutant lines that we thought potentially would have a gene mutated or a gene would’ve been mutated that caused some interesting effect in development.
But most of it was just garbage or not interesting things, and so we would sit there at this dual microscope and you take a slide and we would both look, we put it on, and then our natural competitive sides, because if there was something there you wanted to be the first person to see it. I wanted to see it before she … She’s really good and she’s incredibly sharp eyes and intuitive. For me, it was like, you put the slide on and then you’re looking through stuff. A lot of it is on average, only one slide in 50 is going to be interesting. Yet you want to be the person who’s look. And it’s true that the way this’s competitive, we all have our favourite stocks in part and our favourite genes and our favourite phenomena.
I would love to tell you that this depended heavily on some inner insights, scientific evaluations for why runt is a particularly cool pair-rule gene or what /- – -/ is important for, but the reality is, always in the background for our scientific choices is this memory of the competition. If I happened to have identified runt before she did, embryos before recognizing them on the slide as something interesting and unique, then I, of course, I came to believe that that gene plays some truly central role in the process, because you’d like to imagine. We work very well in that way. I think we are also personally very close friends in that I think we understand each other very well, scientifically, but also personally in terms of … And value each other. Even though we see each other once or twice, I visit Tübingen once a year or so, we don’t see each other that much. We don’t collaborate anymore, we haven’t collaborated for 20 years. She’s still one of my closest friends in the world.";570;Creativity
You were both in your first independent investigator roles when you did that work and I suppose one might have played it a bit safe at that point and just tried to get something under your belt to get the jobs. But obviously just that wasn’t …;"I wasn’t smart enough to play things safe. No one advised us to play things safe. One thing that is probably true is that we didn’t talk to old scientists that much. That’s probably why the silly thing about me giving you this interview and God, if they’re any young scientists out there, they shouldn’t be watching this interview. This is pretty serious.
You feel like a young scientist to talk to.
Eric F. Wieschaus: I think basically it’s probably good to … We didn’t talk to many established scientists. We were aware that most of them thought that what we were doing was stupid or was not likely to work because it would evolve into lots of epiphenomena or things would be too complex or there’d be too many genes or not enough genes. Everybody that we knew, senior scientists that we knew in our field were … I can’t say they actually advised us not to do those experiments, but we knew that we were doing them and they weren’t there to be some obvious reason for that. It wasn’t that we were clever, they probably saw dangers or flaws that we probably didn’t see, which is I suppose a good thing about our age. The fact that we were also very self-sufficient and very interdependent, so talking to her was enough. I didn’t really have to take other people’s opinions very seriously.";570;Creativity
There’s a parallel there with Brown and Goldstein, another great collaborative pair, who also say that each other’s approval was what they sought, in a way.;Yes, right, and that’s certainly true. Getting Janni’s approval is not easy and are not always easy. Particularly if things are … If you’re trying to do that with flawed experiments, that usually doesn’t work. It does set standards and you make choices because there’s enough people out there who are eager to impose or suggest standards to you that you as a scientist have the two choose who matters, whose opinions matter to you. I think we both benefited from making the right choice there. Her opinions matter to me and my opinion mattered to her.;570;Creativity
Let’s turn to the choice of the flies and model organisms. You say you don’t like wasting time and I suppose the fly is the ideal model in that sense that the development lasts 10 days. You can ask a question, get an answer and move on.;"Right. As an undergraduate, when I was learning science, I had my first exposure to flies. I needed money. I got a job in a fly lab making fly food and washing bottles, dirty fly bottles and maintaining fly stocks, stuff like that. I worked in a lab and eventually was able to begin doing genetics experiments. My professor Harvey Bender, who ran this lab, was interested in various aspects of fly genetics. To a certain extent they /- – -/ on adult characters, eye, colour, I think are eye morphology. I thought that was interesting. I like genetics. I learned genetics well, but I didn’t want to do that for the rest of my life. I, as an undergraduate, had taken courses in embryology and I’d seen frog embryos and fish embryos and chicken embryos, and that was the most beautiful thing that I’d seen.
I can remember sitting in the lab after everybody had got home and you do these fertilizations. You can do an in vitro fertilization with frog eggs, and you can see cells divide and you can see stuff happening, and I wanted to know that. I spent a summer, then at the end of my undergraduate period in the embryology course at Woods Hole I got to see many more embryos. That’s what I wanted to do. I wanted to look at embryos and I didn’t want to work on flies. When I went to graduate school. I would’ve been happy never to have seen another fly embryo in my life. The complication in my life, this was a chance thing, but in going to graduate school, my situation was somewhat chancy because this was in good 1969. I grew up in Alabama. Because of my opposition to the Vietnam war, I had applied for a conscientious objector status. This in my local draft board is a very conservative part, no one had ever done this before, and you had to apply for this status based on religious convictions, and at the time I was a Roman Catholic and I believed that my moral convictions were grounded in my … I had tried to apply for this thing, and I failed. I was in the middle of all these legal procedures and I was into reading prison literature because I was convinced that I was going off to prison, but I’d also applied to graduate school and was admitted to graduate school. All this was going on.
Harvey Bender, who was my boss in this fly lab liked me and cared about my future and was concerned about me going to graduate school with this whole huge burden of the Vietnam war and the conscientious rejection and all this stuff, my legal debacle in Alabama. He wrote to the only person whom he knew at Yale, which was Don Poulson, and told him there was this young person coming as graduate student and would he take him under his wing? When I arrived at Yale, Don Poulson, who was about 60 at the time, came and up to me and took me under his wing and took me into his laboratory and was very kind, so kind that I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I never wanted to see another fly lab. I never wanted to see another fly lab or flies in my life. It was good that that happened. I didn’t know who Don Poulson was, Don Poulson was 60 or something at the time. In the 1930s, as a graduate student at Cal Tech, he’d gone to Cal Tech to biochemistry, but got sucked into a fly lab at Cal Tech, and in the 1930s did all of the embryology of Drosophila, all the basic descriptive work, and also all the original work showing that genes controlled the way embryos developed.
He was the only person … This was an important set of experiments, but this was not where science was in 1960. I ended up in his lab, at that point. I didn’t know that flies had embryos. I said this often, I don’t know where I thought flies came from, maybe from rotten flesh and spoiled lasagne or something. Some people thought so. I didn’t realize that flies had embryos or that if you looked at a fly embryo, it would be every bit as beautiful as a frog embryo or a chick embryo, and I learned that from Don Poulson.";570;Meaning(Values) of Work
You inherited this sort of semi-secret stock of knowledge?;"Yes. Then Poulson didn’t want a graduate student. He was being kind to me, but he didn’t want a graduate student. My memory of Paulson mostly is him reading his papers. Then I would see him, this old man, backing into his office when I was coming with all of “This”, and “You said this”. Poulson, after about a year and a half, arranged for me to switch labs and move into the laboratory of a young assistant professor who’d just been hired at Yale, Walter Gehring from Switzerland. Poulson, I think with a lot of relief arranged for me to go over to Walter Gehring’s lab. Walter’s lab at the time was a great, lucky thing, he’d just been hired. His lab was empty and I was his first graduate student.
He just found a technician himself. There were just three people in the lab, and I worked with Walter for the first year side by side, we would transplant cells and do things. His lab gradually grew, and then after about a year and a half, he decided that he was going to leave New Haven in Yale and go back to Switzerland and asked me if I wanted to finish my graduate work in Switzerland with him in his lab. I said, Yes. I’d never been out of the United States before, New Haven was the most exciting place that I’d ever been in up to that point that I got on an airplane and flew over to Switzerland, stayed in Europe then for 10 years. But the whole fly connection, why I ended up working on flies was just extraordinary good luck, because the ability to do genetics on an embryo was the crucial thing that was needed at the time. Many people did genetics and many people did embryology, but by chance, there I was, one of the few people in the world, a small, small little set of people in the world who knew that flies had embryos that were beautiful. Who knew enough fly genetics to think about how one could approach the problem from the standpoint using the past 60, 70 years of Drosophila genetics to solve something that interested me more deeply, which was not genes and was not genetics, but how embryos developed.
Again, it’s the peculiar interplay of chance and talent in having the right tools at the right time the right question is.
Eric F. Wieschaus: And saying, I want to do this thing. This thing is doable. Go for it.";570;Motivation
We’re sitting just up the corridor from your small lab. I wanted to finish by asking you about the students you choose to work with you. What do you look for when you’re picking people?;"I think it helps if they’re smart, at some level you’ve got to bring that to the table. I tend to abandon students fairly quickly in the lab, I would rather that they do experiments that they care about. On the other hand, this is odd. I don’t run a lab so that other people can do experiments that they care about, I’m not that generous. I want to care about their experiments and participate in them at some level. The best thing in my best students always started out with a certain level of independence, but also working with me and then ended up someplace totally different than I would’ve predicted with a set of results or a set of experiments that I didn’t really anticipated, made me rethink what it was that I thought we were doing.
That’s really what you want from students or postdocs in your lab, that they do something that I can take part in because I, like I said, I don’t run my lab so that other people get the opportunity of doing science. I run my lab because I want to do science, but I want to work, so they have to be able to convince me that it’s something worth doing and that I’d be happy to sort flies for them or collect embryos or do some part of this thing. But I’m happiest if they assume responsibility for it. I think that’s the critical thing. I suppose what it means is that I don’t want to assume responsibility. I suppose that really means is I don’t want to assume responsibility for their failure. If they fail, I don’t want it. I don’t want the responsibility of making somebody else’s career. I don’t want to provide a vehicle and a responsibility for doing this and this and then the thing will work if you do what I say. I would rather work with people who, even though they’re at a different stage in their career, are essentially independent scientists with whom I can collaborate.";570;Competencies
It’s the ability to spot those people because you don’t have a high three-foot screening where you’ve got lots of students and you can just pick the ones you like.;"Yes, I think one of the things it’s probably also true that it’s not even a screen, it’s also a matter of adaptability because everybody you work with is different. It’s not like I would look for a certain set of qualities and then only choose people who have those qualities. It’s more that I have to choose some among the large range of qualities that are out there that I could see there’s a potential for me to interact with or to shape myself in response to them. I probably don’t really shape myself that much.
Sounds good.
Eric F. Wieschaus: In a certain sense, I do, I shape myself with a response to them. I am a reactive person, meaning I talk with people and I respond and I’m empathetic. I’m not internally driven enough to expect the world to go through all on my own little tracks. I do adjust my behaviour all the time when I am talking to people. I’m a social human being. In lab it is not so much that it has a certain format of person who will interact well with me, because I kind of change how I talk with or work with people depending on, because science is so peculiar that it is so unpredictable what are the qualities that are required at any moment for any particular problem? I know scientists and this extraordinary heterogeneity of scientists who are successful and some of them are shy and some of them are loud and some of them are showy and some of them are risk takers and some of them are all of these qualities among the really successful scientists that I know.
Some of them seem really, really smart, and some of them don’t necessarily seem so smart, but they really are. This whole heterogeneity of scientists out there. In part what we do as scientists, and this is the thing that I think most people don’t understand about science is how much of a social activity it is.
That’s true. The image is of the lonely person.
Eric F. Wieschaus: The lonely person in the lab and that’s not … The way science works is heavily through a whole variety of different kind of social interaction, some of which are competitive. Either you have your competitors, you have your semi competitors, you have your friends, you have your supporters. All of this kind of a social network in science that reinforces and forces all of us to maintain high standards for our productivity, for experiments, subjects us to criticism at a whole variety of levels. In part, in running a lab, what you want to have is a social structure that mimics that flexibility. You’d like to have people in most successful labs run that way and that they have different kinds of personalities in them. They are extraordinarily supportive places where scientists interact with each other and support each other and criticize each other’s experiments, like a little mom and pop store atmosphere. Small business, a lot of interaction, criticism, sometimes bad emotional blood, more likely like a family where you get a bunch of personalities in a room and they have to keep this boat afloat.";570;Competencies
People are always talking about the role of science in society, but this is the society of science.;"It is something that when I was a child in Alabama, I didn’t know existed. I didn’t know what to be a scientist was. I think that one of the things that I learned at Kansas or going off and being able to work in a laboratory is, at Kansas or being able to work in laboratories at Notre Dame, is how extraordinary gratifying it is for the social aspect that we’re probably all stuck back in our human evolution back. We don’t evolve rapidly if we’re all still biologically stuck back in this hunter gatherer, small tribe stage in terms of our personal interactions. We gravitate towards that social structure and the science, the laboratory academic science, the way we do it now is probably a pretty close approximation for little tribes and little groups of people out there trying to find nuts and edible fruit out in a jungle at that same level. It’s what we’re evolved for.
It’s a lovely idea. There’s a lovely guy called James Curnow who makes furniture. He wrote a book about a challenging time in his life when he decided that he wasn’t going to make any money doing this. He came back to the idea eventually that all he could do was make the furniture he believed in, and somehow things would be right. It sounds like the approach to start, isn’t that different for that? You do the experiments you think are right.
Eric F. Wieschaus: It’s hard nowadays. Maybe I was more naive and I didn’t know as much as young people know now, because of the web, because everybody knows the job market, everybody can follow my postdocs. My graduate students are probably wiser and probably base their decisions on more information and more calculation than I do or ever did. In a way that’s good, but in a way it’s bad because you can’t know everything. The one thing that it’s very hard to know is your own personal quality. What’s hard is you can make the calculation on the average job prospect, and you can make your calculations by what people tell you you should do on average, but that’s not going to get you anywhere. The strength that you bring to science is your own personality, your own weird combination of abilities, my visual orientation or my curiosity or some intuitive ability with math at some level, those weird things that you piece together that makes you dR and different from anybody else. That weird combination, that unusual combination that’s distinct for each individual scientist makes it very hard to calculate career choices based on averages.
All this extra information that’s out there that is in theory helpful, I think might interfere with what’s the strongest thing, strongest determinant, which is this internal personal drive and internal personal necessity of matching who you are in terms of gifts and abilities and desires with a particular scientific problem, with a particular career choice. I think I had the benefit of being internally driven and making almost all of my choices based on that.
And not having the impediment of too much information.
Eric F. Wieschaus: And not having the impediment of too much information. Absolutely. I look at some of the things that I did and I would be very shy to recommend those to anybody, but they were the right things for me. I think that internal sense is something that you have to rely on, when you’re young, as well as when you’re old. You have to rely on it throughout life, I think. If you’re going to make choices that are going to contribute to your happiness or your success, you have to rely on that internal sense of who you are and what matters to you.
That’s a good piece of advice.
Eric F. Wieschaus: Yes.
I couldn’t have been happier with that. It was marvellous stuff. Thank you very much.
Eric F. Wieschaus: Yeah, absolutely. So what do we do now?
We stop. Okay.";570;Role of Science
I’m happy to be here. Your part in the work was the identification of the nature of the transducer, hypothesised by Martin Rodbell, as the protein complex which we now know as the ubiquitous G-proteins, and I’d like to come back to the time of the discovery a little later, but to start off with, I’d like to discuss your scientific beginnings a little. You had quite early exposure to science, and biomedical science in particular, through your father.;"I’m reminded that, there’s an expression of, I guess, particularly wealthy people that were both with a silver spoon in their mouth. A former governor of Texas, Anne Richards once, in commenting on her opponent George Bush, said he was born with a silver foot in his mouth, I think. I was born with a scientific silver spoon in my mouth.
A silver spatula.
Alfred G. Gilman: Yes, and my father was a Ph.D. in biochemistry, he turned to pharmacology, he was on various medical school faculties and he was a terrific father and showed me the pleasures and joys of science as a kid. I’d go down to his lab and watch things and had a wonderful time.
You were even named after the textbook?
Alfred G. Gilman: That is interesting, yes. They had no idea what they were doing at the time, but I was born the same year as my father and Lou Goodman first wrote this textbook, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, so I was given my father’s friend’s name Goodman as a middle name and that has enormously confused generations of medical students for quite some time now as to how that came to be. They imagined all sorts of strange relationships.
And you took over the editing of the textbook.
Alfred G. Gilman: Yes I did, in the mid 1970s.";571;Motivation
Did you know when you were a child that you wanted to be a scientist then?;"Yes, I wanted to be an astronomer and some of my favourite memories of being a kid, we lived in suburbs of New York city, going into the city and visiting museums but especially the hidden planetarium in New York. I remember with great excitement, signing up for a trip to the moon. I can’t remember how, I was probably well maybe 10 years old, so this was maybe in the early 50s and they had a book you could register for a reservation and it seemed quite fanciful at the time.
Biology then came to supplant astronomy at some point.
Alfred G. Gilman: The thing is, a friend of mine had similar thoughts as a child and she once mentioned, but I figured out that astronomers don’t spend all their time looking at stars and interest turned, yes. I became much more interested in biology in high school and college.";571;Motivation
Then Yale and then you made what on reflection was the fairly momentous decision to go and do the MD Ph.D. programme at Case Western with Earl Sutherland, but you refused the first time.;"That’s correct. You know, that was another good example, really, of an advantage I had, I think. Earl Sutherland, who won the Nobel Prize in, and you can probably tell me better than I, maybe the mid-60s, no, probably the mid-70s. He discovered cyclic AMP along with Ted Rall and maybe in 1956-57 he had gone to Cleveland and started this new programme, MD Ph.D. programme. It was quite unique; he knew my father well. He recruited every student into that programme individually, you know, there was no advertising, no marketing, he just got to know people one way or another and it was a small programme and he recruited it.
I think he knew he would see my father in meetings and my father liked to talk about his family, so Earl knew that I existed. He sent me a note and asked me if I’d be interested in looking at the programme and I got the letter when I was a junior in college and I looked at it and said Seven years in Cleveland, no thank you, and I responded back, politely I hope, that I wasn’t interested, but he tried me again in the fall of my senior year and I thought, oh, what the hell, I’ll go check this out, and I did and was very excited about it, so I did it.
So what ‘the hell’ led to your first exposure to second messengers and a career.
Alfred G. Gilman: That’s about right, yes. My big concern was that he was Chairman of a pharmacology department, I was majoring in biochemistry at Yale and I didn’t want to just, you know, follow along in my father’s footsteps too precisely and my father was much more of a physiology and I was more interested in biochemistry. I said to Earl, My only real concern here is that this is pharmacology and he patted me on the back, said don’t worry, he said, pharmacology to us is just biochemistry with a purpose so I think that was the clinching line for him.";571;Creativity
And what was the question that they were asking at Case Western that really got you going? Were you even at that stage interested in the big questions such as how do hormones work?;"That’s correct. You know, that was another good example, really, of an advantage I had, I think.

So what ‘the hell’ led to your first exposure to second messengers and a career.;That’s about right, yes. My big concern was that he was Chairman of a pharmacology department, I was majoring in biochemistry at Yale and I didn’t want to just, you know, follow along in my father’s footsteps too precisely and my father was much more of a physiology and I was more interested in biochemistry.

And what was the question that they were asking at Case Western that really got you going? Were you even at that stage interested in the big questions such as how do hormones work?;"That was Earl’s question, how does a hormone work and the system he was studying, he had grown up under the tutorage of Carl and Gerty Cori, so a train of Nobel’s. He was in St Louis at Washington University which was in many ways the birthplace of so much in biochemistry in the United States. Earl was particularly interested in epinethrine and glucagons and how did the action of those two hormones result in hypoglycaemia, that was the increase in blood sugar. It was a biochemical parameter that could be measured.
We gave a hormone to an animal, blood sugar went up, what was in between and Earl ultimately took that problem to understanding that the hormone worked at the outer surface of the cell, stimulated somehow the generation of this so called second messenger, cyclic AMP, which was his key discovery and that cyclic AMP went on inside the cell to stimulate the enzymatic reactions that cause the breakdown of stored sugar or glycagon, broke down into sugar and released into the body. So that was the problem and Earl brought it to a very substantial level and others included us picked up from there.
So you picked up on the question of what lay between the outer surface and cyclic AMP?
Alfred G. Gilman: Really, yes.";571;Creativity
And that fascinated you from the beginning?;"That was the black box. The inside part was pretty well worked out, the details of what went on inside the cell, but what happened at the cell surface, how that information got from outside to inside was a mystery.
Were you aware when you sort of pondered taking on this question that there was a great lineage of august figures behind you or was it just …?
Alfred G. Gilman: I guess intellectually I was, but I’m not sure emotionally whether that was, probably not a big factor.
Because there’s so many questions to ask, it’s lovely to find your questions so early and then stick with it, it shows great foresight but also great luck.
Alfred G. Gilman: I’m not sure, you know, how well the question was framed at that point. When I took my first job, the first grant I wrote, the title was The Role of Cyclic AMP in Neurons and Glia.
Hedging your bets.
Alfred G. Gilman There was more of focus on deciphering specificity in the nervous system and just who was doing what to what cells types and what those interactions looked like. This was in the very early 1970s and there was certainly a piece of it interested in the receptors and how that all worked but questions were phrased more broadly and less specifically. I think I probably became a lot more specific as data and experimental success led you on one path or another.";571;Motivation
Because I suppose there are a lot of people, young scientists, who are fishing around for the right question to ask and are very worried about the finding of that right question, which will lead them on the correct path.;"I think one shouldn’t be concerned about being too specific about that question too early. You need to find an area of importance and something where there are big questions, hopefully more than one and to begin to hone in on an area first. I don’t think that the questions need to get too specific too soon.
There’s a balance between not getting too specific and being too broad and therefore being a bit dissipated, I imagine.
Alfred G. Gilman: Yes, yes.";571;Advice  for young scientists
How interesting, so there was a generation of doctors who wanted to look at basic science for a while?;"I recall also, I was one of the very early MD Ph.D. graduates. The path for many at that time was to get a medical degree and that’s the path I thought I was going to follow, to get an MD and then get research training afterwards and many, many people did that, that’s the way that academic departments of medicine were populated with researchers, was via that route and there was a lot of motivation for people to go that route at that period of time. Let me go back a little bit though because we’ve neglected someone who was very important.
Earl Sutherland recruited me to that programme in Cleveland, but he left very shortly after I got there and my Ph.D. advisor was his young colleague, Ted Rall who was the one I did all my work with and I owe an enormous amount to him and he was a spectacular mentor. I was married early during that period of time and that programme and a classic line in our household when I get home at 8 or 9 o’clock for dinner was, make my excuses to my young wife saying, I just stopped in Ted’s office to say a couple of things around six and that was 8.30 before we stopped. So he was incredibly generous with his time and advice and we just had a wonderful relationship.";571;Creativity
Was he very selective in the people he brought into the lab to work with, I imagine he must have been if he was going to devote such time to their relationships?;It was a relatively small lab and most labs were relatively small in the 1960s, it was sort of before big science or bigger science.;571;Environment
It must have been both exciting and overwhelming to have somebody focus on you to that degree, when you’re so young.;"It seemed natural. It was the way it worked and that was the way it was in that department, it was the Department of Pharmacology at Western Reserve, now Case Western Reserve. I think there were many things that were done on a smaller scale then and there was a lot more time. There was a lot more time to think, a lot more time to interact more closely with people.
What about in the way that you did experiments. Was that very different from now, somewhat?
Alfred G. Gilman: Everything was much less automated, much more manual, much more hands on. It was reasonably primitive by today’s standards.
Primitive, but you understood what you were doing, you understood what the technology was delivering.
Alfred G. Gilman: Yes, there wasn’t that much technology but we certainly understood what it was delivering.
And do you think that makes a difference?
Alfred G. Gilman: I’m not sure exactly what level you’re asking the question. We could not envision then things that can be done in a matter of a day or a week now. The notion of purifying a protein was daunting enough, let alone having the sequence of a protein, there were two or three examples at the time and so on and probably not much else. The notion of understanding how proteins worked and the level of detail, the notion of understanding what a protein looked like, how it interacted with the … These were pretty difficult to fathom at the time.";571;Creativity
But maybe more accessible to young students as well, that you could undertake experiments that other people were doing in their labs without having to go out and get a big grant to get the equipment etc.;"That’s true but the equipment was also expensive and … the grants were much smaller. I’m sure that everything scales. But the question at the time and Earl Sutherland phrased this question … The technical way to ask the question was the beta-adrenergic receptor, the enzyme that made cyclic AMP. To put it in more allayed terms was, was there just a single component in the cell surface membrane that allowed the information to get across.
Or were there a chain of events?
Alfred G. Gilman: Yes, chain of events or was it all one thing and it was very difficult even to think about how to answer that question. Today it’s trivial to think about how to answer that question but it wasn’t at the time.";571;Competencies
Many things, yes, so I was going to ask, what made you come and stay?;Let me say first, I had a wonderful 10 years at the University of Virginia, it was a terrific place to launch my career. It was, I think, a pretty nurturing environment with a good, excellent Department Chairman Joe Larner, who recruited me there. He had been in Cleveland, I had known him as a student and I got a great start there. Dallas offered opportunities on a grander scale. This is a very ambitious place and it’s ambitious to excel, particularly in terms of research. It’s ambitious, I think, in all the finer senses of the word to have fantastic research programmes of highest quality, answering major questions and I think it’s reasonably entrepreneurial, people who do well are well supported by the institution in ways that I couldn’t imagine ever changing. There really is strong institutional support for people who succeed and I think that was obvious in the way that people’s careers were going here, particularly my good friends Joe Goldstein and Mike Brown who were instrumental in recruiting me here.;571;Environment
And Joe and you had been post-docs together.;"Joe and I were both in the Nirenberg lab all though he was still in the protein synthesis section which was being led by Tom Caskey at the time, so Joe and I knew each other and we were on separate floors, sort of in different areas of interest but I knew Joe. Joe had been a medical student here, he went off to clinical training in Boston and in Seattle, research training, pardon me, in clinical training in Boston and then research training at NIH in Seattle and Joe and Mike had gotten together and were doing fantastic things and were having great careers here and were a shining example of success and how successful people were treated in Dallas. Joe Goldstein called me to ask me about the position in maybe 1979, I think, and I was very busy and told Joe I wasn’t interested.
The story gets sort of amusing because then they really successfully recruited Marty Rodbell, of course with whom I shared the Nobel, and Marty accepted the job here but then for personal reasons had to back out at the last moment. Seldin came back to me and called me one day on the phone and Don remains an extraordinarily forceful personality with incredible vision and great gift of gab and he called me up, said would you do me the courtesy of just giving me 15 minutes on the phone and I got the next word in I think about 1½ hours later and I was pretty well hooked, perhaps, at that point. Made a visit and it all went very quickly. But this was and still is a young school, they had a great vision of growth and great plans for success and it was very attractive and a terrific decision I made to come here. Schools continued to grow enormously and have been very successful";571;Creativity
Certainly so and they seem to have an unerring accuracy for recruiting future Nobel Laureates to their faculty.;You know I’d put a lot of that good decision making in the hands of relatively few people who are gifted. Don Seldin had the gift from the very beginning and he is the man, I think, if you wanted to pick a single individual who really got the school going in the proper directions and fostered its growth, he’s the man and the stories are famous. He had really nothing to work with, it was a pretty primitive place and he would go into the medical school class and identify bright young talent and take that talent under its wing and with his strong persuasive powers, sculpt its career and there are many famous examples of that, Joe Goldstein being the best. Joe came here. He was born in South Carolina, went to William and Mary, I think, as an undergraduate, came here to medical school thinking that he might be a neurosurgeon and Don Seldin turned him into a molecular geneticist so that’s it, that’s persuasion and there are many other examples but the ability to identify talent like that is something quite unusual and Don had it and Joe has it and Joe and Mike especially have played a huge role in sculpting the school further and others of us have joined along the way.;571;Impact of the Nobel on you
I guess the standalone medical school faces certain challenges of not having the surrounding media for research, but that’s also a problem that has been addressed.;I think, in terms of the history of this school in Dallas, I think it being a standalone medical school has at times been an advantage and at times it’s a disadvantage. We have profited in this city enormously from generosity of the Dallas community and philanthropy has played a very important role in the growth of the school.;571;Roles of science (scientists)
Did that increase greatly once Nobel Laureates were there?;"It certainly helped. I think that made a big impact and there are certainly some major donors who were perhaps sceptical of the school’s future and the Nobel Prize puts a seal of approval, quite like no other on an enterprise and so yes, I think that was hugely important and the first one which involved two individuals, Joe Goldstein and Mike Brown, the first one, was incredibly important, the second one was wow and then there was a little bit of frosting on the cake, so I think it has had a huge impact. Dr Wildenthal, our president, loves to show a slide of the four of us together and proudly proclaims that no other president of a medical school in the world perhaps can show that he’s got four still active Nobel Laureates on the faculty. So, that’s been a great help and so philanthropy in Dallas has been hugely important to us.
Modern communication makes it a lot easier, you can move electrons a lot faster than people …
At the same time, I think particularly now in this century, the need for interactions of medicine that interfaces with virtually all the other sciences are critical. 20th century medicine was young and unsophisticated and perhaps couldn’t benefit as much as one might hope from strong interactions with chemistry, chemistry perhaps, yes, but physical sciences, computational sciences, engineering sciences not as much, but that’s changing dramatically now and we need all those interactions and being a freestanding medical school is a disadvantage in that regard, but we’re working hard to fix those things. Modern communication makes it a lot easier, you can move electrons a lot faster than people and so communication helps a great deal. In addition, we have two components to general academic campuses at the University of Texas system in this area, you know, University of Texas at Dallas and University of Texas at Arlington, they both have strong science programmes, particularly in engineering and computer science and we’re establishing strong ties with them and will all go very well for the continued growth of this place.";571;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What do you think the school misses most at the moment?  What does it need?;I don’t think there are any really glaring weaknesses. There are areas where we are stronger than others. The laboratory based sciences are our traditional strength and we’re very good at it. Things that we’re really trying to build now include greater strength in clinical research and translational research on the one hand and on the other these interfaces, particularly with engineering, computationals, computer science, chemistry and physics.;571;Environment
So on the former, have you got drug discovery efforts, for instance, going on here on campus?;"Yes and that’s a very nice outgrowth of one of our first moves to establishing interfaces, so Steve McKnight who’s chairman of biochemistry here has built a very strong, basic chemistry programme within biochemistry. Some are very pleased to look at this department and say Steve has put the chemistry back in lab chemistry, and there are half a dozen really superb young chemists in that department. And these are young people who I think have had the courage and vision to say, no I don’t want to be part of a traditional chemistry department, being here is like being a kid in a candy store because you’re in the midst of all this biology, so you’re sort of swimming in a possibility of interactions and collaborations.
One by one, these young folks have come here and taken advantage of it and really done very well with it so, you know, companies have been spun off, drugs are in clinical trials and it’s easy to see how this has come about from interactions of strong biochemists and molecular biologists on the one hand and the chemists on the other. Targets have been identified, screens have been run and targets of, you know, drug candidates have been discovered and optimised and the process is moving on, so it’s going very nicely and now we’re building the capabilities to move those things further down the stream and really do much more in terms of clinical trials ourselves.";571;Motivation
Right and is it a disadvantage? I suppose it is a little bit of a disadvantage that there isn’t very much major pharma based around here.;I think that is a disadvantage and we have tried to and are trying to catalyse the growth of biotechnology in Dallas, it’s been slow, it’s been slow almost everywhere except the coast and just really in a few major cities on the coast and there’s a huge focus. I think it’ll happen, it’ll come.;571;Creativity
I suppose there’s an effort in biotech and drug discovery to put the clinical back into their efforts so you stand in a good position there.;Alfred G. Gilman Drug discovery is a whole huge and interesting and difficult subject these days but obviously many alliances of biotechnology companies with big pharma to accomplish those things and also with academia.;571;Role of Science
In terms of forming alliances, I know that you have put your heart and soul, for a while, in the Alliance for Cellular Signaling. A massive collaboration to work out the entire repertoire of signalling molecules within two cell types. What did that experience teach you about the necessary prerequisites for forming such collaborative networks?;"They taught me a lot about management for one thing but the Alliance has been very successful in some ways and not as successful in others, as I might have hoped and it’s still ongoing and on a slightly smaller scale, which has probably served it reasonably well to scale down some of its ambitions and efforts. Collaboration in biology is a very interesting subject at the moment, I think. Other sciences have gone further in that direction, I think physics being the best example, where it’s been driven by various specific needs for instrumentation and equipment that costs millions and millions, if not 100s of millions or billions of dollars and then collaboration is an absolute necessity and if it’s a necessity, people do it. In biology and biomedical science, successful grand collaborations have been driven by very specific … and the most obvious is the sequencing of the human genome and that was a very specific project and a business-like plan that you could put together and do it.
… it’s more problematic to get people working together at a discovery level than at a more technological level …
At the more fundamental and more discovery oriented biology, it’s still a little harder, I think, to get people together. A lot of that I think is still very much driven by individual genius, individual creativity, individual motivation and egos and egos are certainly a part of this and it’s more problematic to get people working together at a discovery level than at a more technological level. It’s going to come and it will happen more as people begin to get more into the really big problems of biology, how do really complex systems work? The magnitude of the problems is extraordinary and the difficulty is extraordinary and concerted efforts are going to be necessary and they’re happening but I think they’re just more difficult from really sort of a fundamental management point of view.
It is the trend for people to form these networks increasingly …
Alfred G. Gilman: It is a trend.
.And yet a lot of those networks don’t quite fulfil the goals they set out with.
Alfred G. Gilman: I think it’s very early to tell, in terms of the success of many of them, but I think obviously there’s growing success for sure in terms of putting unconventional or not unconventional but interdisciplinary people together and really letting things happen based on interactions that haven’t happened before. We are working now on a concept, I hope it may happen, it’s too early to tell but a concept of an Institute within the University of Texas system for example that would need not be confined to the University of Texas but that would be one possible mechanism, but to create a really interdisciplinary institute that would get into big problems of systems biology and cross fertilisation between biology and engineering sciences, for example. We think the way to do that now would be really to bring really interdisciplinary people together, rather than creating an interdisciplinary Institute composed of a specialist here and a specialist there. The communication barriers remain huge and it’s still very tough for a physician to talk to an engineer.";571;Creativity
You know the engineer says what’s that squiggly stuff and the doctor says that’s DNA.;"Yes, so it’s a challenge, but there’s a growing number of rare breeds of people who can transcend themselves and putting those people together in a proper environment, I think there’s potential great gain to be had there and we’re talking about trying to approach problems. All of these problems in biology span huge scales and this is part of the issue so, one way to think about it is that biology build machines or organisms or people whose dimensions are in metres. We build these out of pieces whose dimensions are nanometres, so you know there’s a scale of 9, 10, 11 orders of magnitude and there’s a temporal scale too and motions of molecules that happen in nanoseconds and drive events that are measured all the way to lifetimes of organisms or even evolutionary timescales.
So, there are even more orders of magnitude there and finding people who are driven by the notion of finding out whether things that they can measure that happen in nanoseconds of milliseconds, how relevant are they to events that play out over minutes, days, weeks, years or lifetimes. That’s an interesting way of thinking and I think people who are driven to thinking those sorts of ways will make each contribution.
It’s a very appealing concept to work with, the idea of existing on such a scale that …
Alfred G. Gilman: It’s a daunting concept to work with and the technical challenges are enormous, I mean the ways that you measure things that happen in milliseconds and the ways that you measure things that happen in years.";571;Creativity
In your mind that’s one key to the systems biology problem that people have to get away from only thinking about the system that they all study, which may be for instance a very small scale.;Another way of thinking about it is the value of understanding how something came to be, not just what it looks like but why does it look that way and what was the process that created it, so really thinking in evolutionary terms. If you can understand why a system was built the way it was and what constraints evolution put on the way that the thing was built, I think, and this isn’t all completely intuitive and obvious but I think that you will acquire deep insight into how something really works if you understand how it came to be, rather than just what it looks like when it was finished.;571;Meaning(Values) of Work
Given that question, you then as you say, need to get people together in the same institute, they need to work in close proximity.;"I think people working at different ends of that spectrum, of different ends of the spacial scale spectrum and the temporal scale spectrum.
Sounds a very attractive prospective.
Alfred G. Gilman: I hope so and many of these ideas are not mine, they’re circulating around widely but we’ve been talking about the idea of creating this institute and particularly talking with some of my young colleagues here who’s minds are still very flexible and who think very well in these directions and I’ve been trying to learn from them.";571;Creativity
Is that the major thrust of your current efforts as Dean of the medical school?;It’s one and I think really trying to work on two major things simultaneously, one the translational and clinical side, say in the laboratory research particularly here is in strong shape, we need to push translational medicine and clinical research much further in that way and also the more fundamental interfaces in the other, so we want to span that scale too.;571;Career Development
I also wanted to ask you about the effect of the Nobel Prize on your career, in a sort of general sense. It’s a difficult question but I imagine that obviously, it had a very positive effect, it may also have had some detrimental effects on your research I imagine?;"It can be a distraction. It’s a ticket to travel the world, if you want one, and it’s an opportunity to do many things. It’s an opportunity to be heard, whether you have anything to say or not, some people do and some people don’t and I think people handle it very differently and if you want to stay focussed in your laboratory as many do, you need to acquire a very fine sense of how to say no and because you’re going to be turning down hundreds of invitations. If you want a bully pulpit, you sure have one and many people are doing terrific things with that. Just yesterday evening I was at a dinner with Peter Agre, who won the Prize in Chemistry a few years ago now.
2003 I think.
Alfred G. Gilman: I think 2003 is right and Peter has very well thought out and well expressed feelings about the role of science and public policy and the fact that science is not being heard adequately, I think by politicians and public policymakers and he is outspoken on that subject and I think very well spoken on that subject and the Nobel Prize gives him a lot of bully pulpit, gives him a lot of credibility. He’s even thinking of running for public office and I guess I hope he does but if he does, I sincerely hope he succeeds at it, but I’m not sure whether the American public is ready for a Nobel Laureate as Senator from the state of wherever, but it would be interesting. Some states are more ready than others.
The Nobel sort of imprint tends to allow one to comment on things way outside one’s subject area.
Alfred G. Gilman: Yes and some people, you know, occasionally one goes too far but good judgement and all things unless it’s useful.
But you took the other course, you decided not to use it for that but to use it rather for …?
Alfred G. Gilman: Well, I’d say for the first half dozen years ago after my good fortune, really stayed very well focussed on my own laboratory. Other opportunities then came along and I decided to pursue some of them. The most drastic obviously being becoming Dean of the medical school and now Provost here and in some ways there’s a little bit of guilt perhaps for leaving the lab but I’ve enjoyed what I’m doing now a lot. I focussed on the laboratory for the better part of 40 years. I’m a pretty competitive individual really, and I like to think that whatever I’m doing I’m doing my best at it and I don’t necessarily think that I’m as creative a scientist at the age of 65 as I was at the age of 45.
Frankly I don’t think anybody is, brains get a little fossilised. Opportunity to do something really different came along and I decided to take a little try at it and then decided I very much enjoyed it and it’s a very different sort of life. I’ve learned more about how this school and how medical schools and universities work in general in the last two or three beta-adrenergic receptor years than I learned in the prior 30. Interact with a much broader sphere of people, cross a much bigger range of interests and disciplines and I’m enjoying that. I think there’s a little lingering guilt but there’s also some real pleasure in the new activities.";571;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Is there any lingering sense of a career that you might have done other than the one you’ve chosen?;"Oh sure. We can go back to astronomy and astrophysics and I don’t think I didn’t have a talent for it but, unravelling the mysteries of the universe is a reasonably noble goal. I was a not very talented clarinet and saxophone player as a youth, a career as a musician would have been quite wonderful. Huge numbers of things left undone for sure that everybody would like to do. I also am a pretty focussed individual and maybe excessively so, get very caught up in what I’m doing and I’d like to go back through it all again and spend a little more time with my family and my children than I did. I wasn’t as good a father as my father was to me.
Are they, do you think an understanding family?
Alfred G. Gilman: They’re a very understanding family.
Yeah, they must be very proud?
Alfred G. Gilman: I hope so. I have a wonderful wife and three superb children, who are all doing very, very well.
Did any of them go into science?
Alfred G. Gilman: No. Perhaps they saw someone who was a little too focussed. My kids like to say that when they came to me with a science question based on their schoolwork or other, they wanted the five minute answer and they got the 45 minute answers. Maybe I just didn’t know when to shut up.
They sound like many medical students in the making.
Alfred G. Gilman: Yes, could be. None of them is in science.";571;Creativity
When you have students coming through or when you had students coming through the lab and now you have whole faculties to look after and you see people making their choices and you want to help them go the right path, is it possible to reflect on what sort of mentor you are to people?;"That’s really hard I think. Mentoring has become a very, very popular subject. I hear the word constantly and I will admit to sometimes having mixed feelings about it because I think there’s a lot of discussion of mentoring programmes and formal programmes and teaching people to be mentors and of course then evaluating the quality of people’s mentoring activities, etc, etc, etc and I sometimes think it’s getting maybe a bit too programmed and looks a bit too much like a business plan and I think a great deal of it is still very spontaneous and one on one activity.
When I hear we must find someone, a mentor, frequently my first reaction is people need to find their own mentors. Yes, they should be helped and I don’t mean to sound like a bad guy about it but I think there’s still a good deal of spontaneity that’s required here and that it needs to be comfortable from both sides and it’s just not something that necessarily can be assigned. At the sort of level that you get mentored as a Ph.D. student, it requires a reasonably decent personal interaction and close relationship and that’s the most effective sort of mentoring.";571;Mentors (Role models)
I suppose it’s a question of time. It’s the spontaneous coming out like for dinner?;Yes and you know this is the biggest problem. I mean I sound like an old curmudgeon at this point but the pace of life is much, much faster, everything is faster and if access to information is instantaneous, that’s all great and wonderful but it consumes us and there is not as much time available for and there’s certainly not as much time spent on personal interactions and thought and reflection and everything is just much more fast paced and the biggest complaint I hear from everyone, especially faculties is there’s too many demands, you’re asking us to do too many things and that’s probably true, we are.;571;Creativity
Where did the extra demand come from though, because basically what medical schools do now is what they did 40 years ago?;Frankly, a lot of it’s economic. On the clinical side, can our clinical faculty teach, can they do clinical research, can they do laboratory research and can they also be clinicians? A lot of that pressure is how they earn their salaries and we go from there to the entire economics of the healthcare industry and if you have a few weeks we could bring in a whole bunch of people and talk about that but it’s enormously complex and there’s a lot of conflicts there and just how people can exist and survive in an academic setting and have clinical activities and research activities and earn their salary for it.;571;Environment
It comes again to that word you use, focus. It’s finding people who can maintain their focus despite all this stuff going on around them and presumably those individuals shine out, it’s easy to spot?;"Yes and an example is they have to make choices. If I want to have an active research career and be a clinician, I’m going to earn less than the person who’s just going to be a clinician, in order to focus exclusively on being a clinician. On the basic science side, there’s a lot of pressure to generate funding for your laboratory research, the money’s got to come from some place. In the United States we’re very well blessed with public funding for science, more so than in any other country in the world but that funding is tight at the moment.
The competition for it is ferocious, only 10 or 15% of new grant applications are successful and that means you write more of them and worry more over each one of them and spend a lot more time competing for the money, than doing the actual research. There are also many issues of accountability for what we’re all doing, rules, regulations, compliance, more forms to be filled out, more regulations to be satisfied and these are distractions too, they’re important ones but they’re distractions and people are increasingly frustrated by them.";571;Creativity
Do you think that the situation in future years, funding in this country, is going to be similar? What do the auguries look like?;It’s cyclical and things get better or they get worse. The concerns of the moment are the level of funding for sure. Another major concern is the number of young people who are going into scientific careers. There’s a paucity of US educated students who are going into basic science careers and many probable causes for it. A public education system that is I think weak as far as science education is concerned, there are many reflections of that in terms of scientific awareness in this society, so that is a big issue and I think the perceived level of competition and compensation in careers in science is probably a bit of a turnoff as well. So the United States is relying more and more on foreign born scientists, who are coming to be trained here and happily, many are staying here and that’s a clear trend and so those are big issues too.;571;Diversity-Women in Science
In terms of the outreach to children and getting children interested in science, it is strange, isn’t it, because the US has a very high level of competence at reading at very young ages and then suddenly it seems to fall behind on scientific education?;"I’m not aware of the reading statistics, I’m glad to hear that something seems to be going well but, you know, most of the data I see shows US school children well behind many, many other countries in the world in terms of educational competence and there’s growing concern about the problem and various programmes that will hopefully be effective in correcting it.
But I still fail to see a real public commitment to public education in this country and I think there’s sad reflections of that in terms of things that just jar badly with … sensitivities and beliefs. The percentage of people in this country who believe in evolution is horrifying. The number of people who think that human beings and dinosaurs co-habitated the earth – they didn’t. The number of people who think that the earth is 10,000 years old – it isn’t. The scientific evidence there is irrefutable. Other issues of global warming may be more debatable but not that much more, I don’t think and the level of scientific ignorance in this country or even suspicion of science is way too high.";571;Motivation
Three days ago, there was a major announcement, a major event in science, you could say, a joint announcement by groups in the United States and the United Kingdom about, I would say, a high-quality DNA sequence of the entire human genome and the significance of this event was underlined by the fact that two heads of state, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, had joined the press conference. We are happy to have here among us two Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine, Professor or Doctor Richard Roberts and Hamilton Smith who have been involved in various capacity in the human genome project. In fact, one of you was actually present at the White House during this press conference. Would you like to take it on from here?;"Hamilton Smith: I’m actually an employee of Celera Genomics, which is a company in Rockville Maryland that has been single-handedly determining the human genome sequence in what many have called a race with the rest of the world, with the public efforts which carried on in the United States, England, Germany and Japan and I think some other countries. The White House ceremony was an attempt to get a cooperation between the public effort and the private effort, not a collaboration but a cooperation where we would agree to not say bad things about each other’s approaches or data or personalities and that we would try to do joint publications in a scientific journal, sometime near the end of the year 2000. Not papers that have joint authorship between the groups but separate publications where we present our accomplishments. I think it’s been a very good thing actually to do this, it takes the focus of the press coverage away from the warring parties and gets it back to what’s really important, namely getting the sequence and getting it out to the public.
The ceremony itself, President Clinton gave a short talk of about 4-5 minutes and then, by a TV hook-up in England, Tony Blair came on and said a few words in his best oratorical style and then President Clinton introduced briefly Francis Collins, who’s head of the public effort in the US and of course there were words said about the DoE part of the effort and there were nice things said all over the place. It was really a pretty good show and then Craig Venter was the last speaker. I was wondering when he went up to the microphones, whether there was anything left to be said but Craig, I think, handled this situation extremely well and got across how Celera fits into this accomplishment. So, we had a press conference afterwards. I think it was not only a truce between the public and private efforts but also an announcement that each of the groups had achieved their goals. The public human genome project announced that they had completed a working draft of the genome which represents about a 90% coverage of the genome but without a complete assembling of the genome and Celera announced that they had a 99% random coverage of the genome with an assembly of those sequences, so that genes are laid down linearly along the chromosomes.";573;Future research
Now that we have two independent groups who have come to an agreement about the general structure of the human genome, maybe you are able to answer the question, how many genes are there in the human genome. It’s a question you get when you lecture in this field and I’ve heard widely varying figures so, now if you get the question, what would your answer be?;"Hamilton Smith: I think at this moment we still are in considerable doubt, but at Celera we’re also sequencing the mouse genome which will be complete sometime before the end of the year, to the extent that we can compare the mouse sequence to the human sequence. The protein coding regions of the mouse and human are sufficiently similar that they can be aligned, whereas the so called junk DNA, the 97% of the genome which doesn’t code for …
Richard Roberts: You’re talking about this stuff I discovered, are you?
Hamilton Smith: Yes, something like that.
Richard Roberts: The junk.
Hamilton Smith: Yes, the junk.
Hamilton Smith: … is more dissimilar, so it should be possible to simply read the two genomes in six frames and with high probability overlap the protein coding regions and get a fairly precise count of how many genes are present and that’s really the strategy that we’re pursuing. We have the mouse sequence, or we will have the mouse sequence and we’re the only ones in the world that will have it, so I think Celera will have the most accurate annotation.";573;Meaning(Values) of Work
Because people are betting on the number and there is a need for an authoritative answer to this question from the gambling point of view and from the human centred views that we entertain. To drive these large projects, the human genome project, obviously there have been precursors, people have got news from physics now that they are enormous projects, big physics and you now have big biology coming around, so once the human genome project has been completed, how will we proceed? I think we would agree that the most important thing now is to find out how the genome functions and we now enter then a type of research where we want to study the ultimate products, the proteins. Since there are many ways in which you can process the information from the DNA and the genome, at the RNA level, there are many more proteins to be found. This field of studying the proteins made in biological systems is called proteomics, so do you see any such big proteomics coming along and what can be done in terms of technology to speed up the analysis of the much larger number of proteins than the number of genes?;"Hamilton Smith: I mean, I can say pretty much what we are planning at Celera. Celera I think is unique in its ability to do very large scale surveys. We don’t like really doing anything unless we can do 100,000 a day of whatever it is, so this is a way Craig Venter thinks and it allows us to do things that can’t be done easily in the university setting or in most other companies. What we’re planning of course is to move into proteomics using new instrumentation from PE Bio systems, mass spectrometers that can analyse tens of thousands of samples per day of protein. The plan would be to, the big interest initially I think is to see the spectrum of proteins that are being made in specific tissues, normal or diseased tissues, cancer, whatever. The plan would be to separate these proteins from say a cancer tissue on two-dimensional gels and then each single protein spot on the gel would be analysed in the mass spectrometer. Essentially hit by a laser blown into fragments of the protein which would then be matched with the genomic sequence and by computer, one should be able to predict the protein peptide spectrum that you would get for each of the genes in the human genome. Let’s say there are 50,000, so that we would get a virtually instantaneous identification of the particular gene product for each of the spots and we could say then that a given tissue is expressing certain genes and we form a database of this kind of information and again we sell that to our subscribers. This is sort of a first step of something that we can easily see ahead that we could produce this. I don’t know where we’re going beyond that but maybe Rich could.
Richard Roberts: The real problem with proteomics is that much of the technology that you need to relate function back to the gene is not in place at the moment, so one issue is well what is being expressed, how much is being expressed if we look at particular tissues, if we look at the brain, if we look at skin, if we look at liver, what kinds of proteins are taking place? At the moment we are able to look at what messenger RNAs are taking place, but we know also from other experiments that the amount of protein very often does not match the level of RNA, so we need both to be able to look at RNA and to look at the protein. One way to look at the protein is to use the kind of technology that Ham just talked about.";573;Research
You made a point in one of the sessions at this meeting that once you study microbial genomes and there is a project called the minimal genome project which tries to define what’s the minimum number of genes. Wouldn’t such a system be the most suitable in finding out the function of various genes, because the human with this much larger genome and many genes is incredibly more complex?;"Richard Roberts: Right. I think there are two separate issues, one issue relates to what is it that really makes life, what do you need, what is the minimum set of instructions that you need to make a living cell? And one way to do that is to take the very smallest cell that we know that is free living, as Clyde Hutchison is doing, and try to remove the genes that look as though they’re not necessary, get down to the minimum set, understand that in completion. Then one will at least know what is the minimum thing you need for life but that’s likely to be less than 500 genes and those 500 genes are a small set of what is present in a human cell. So, I think what will come from say the minimal genome project will be a working definition of kind of what is the minimum of life but there’s so much more to life than that. We need to know what is the precise biochemical function of each of the gene products, what reactions does it catalyse? That is something that for most proteins is not easy to do and we’re working ourselves at the moment on a bunch of proteins that are present in every organism for which the genome has been sequenced so far.
We think that this particular protein transfers methyl groups from S-Adenosyl methionine onto something, but we don’t know what and it’s not easy to find out, it’s not easy to prove that. But it is an interesting protein, it’s present in every genome but we don’t know what it does, no-one has stumbled upon it by genetics or by biochemistry yet, to know what it does and there are many such proteins. In the human genome, there are going to be thousands of these proteins for which we need to define function so what we need is to find high throughput ways, fast ways in which we can get clues to function. One high throughput way is to use computation to try to do that, so you look through the protein sequences, you try to find the little protein sequence motifs that in other proteins we know interact with ATP or they interact with DNA or they’re RNA binding proteins or whatever, so this can give you a clue, but you need to do the biochemistry afterwards to show that the clues that were given were correct or not and we don’t have good methods for doing that at the moment.
Hamilton Smith: Another approach to the minimal genome is the synthetic approach which I think is intriguing, creating “life” in the laboratory. The idea there would be again working with the mycoplasma genitalium is sort of the basic tools or parts for it. Having some idea from the other studies as to what genes are essential, one could actually make a synthetic chromosome that contains the set of proteins that have been identified as essential and then put that synthetic chromosome into a cell from which the natural chromosome has been removed and then see if you get something that will grow in the laboratory. Of course it probably won’t work the first time, maybe not the 100th time either, it could be somewhere to cloning Dolly and in the beginning you had to do hundreds of them before you got a successful attempt. But it would be a spectacular event if one could create a new genome.
Richard Roberts: I guess, when you start to think about the real importance of microbiological research, within the context of the human genome, the methodology that will need to be developed to understand how something as simple as mycoplasma genitalium work is going to methodology that can be applied to the human genome. So if we can learn to do this thing properly and if we can learn to do it in a fast manner for the small bacterial genomes, where in principle everything is a lot easier, we should be able to apply that methodology to these much more complicated systems too and in the meantime of course, we will find out much about what is really important in order to make life. What is it about these proteins and these genes that really makes something living as opposed to just a collection of chemicals in a test tube.";573;Meaning(Values) of Work
If we look at the biomedical benefits of the DNA sequence of the human genome, I’m sure when Jim Watson went to congress, he had many ideas on what the benefits would be and tried to convince the congress and I noticed also that Bill Clinton mentioned cancer, the cure of cancer would be something that would be following after the sequencing. How do you see the immediate consequences in the biomedical field of our knowledge of the human genome sequence?;Hamilton Smith: I don’t think I can foresee all of the benefits or consequences, we’re going to have to work into it gradually, but I it seems clear that it would facilitate much of the work that’s going on. A lot of work over the past few years has gone into hunting for genes in the genome and sub-cloning them and so on and so forth. This should short circuit all of that, I mean you should be able to in many cases find a gene or several duplications of the gene in the genome and proceed from that sort of jumpstart. I think an example would be, there are several groups of proteins that have demonstrated therapeutic benefits, for example the interferons and already we have an example by the genome sequencing of a new interferon which was previously not detected. With the whole genome you can look and often find members of a protein group that you didn’t know about, so these are new potential products. We could discover new epogen type proteins as well or growth factors that can stimulate certain tissues simply by analogy to ones that are already known.;573;Future research
Will it be possible to sequence a genome of individuals in the short time, in such a short time that it would be important in medical practice, in designing the therapy one is planning for a certain disease?;"Hamilton Smith: Not with current technology, it’s too expensive. Eventually I think that we will need some sort of a physical method for single molecule sequencing. Once that arrives, we might be able to tackle the whole individual, but one of the big areas of effort now is large scale genotyping using various arrays of genes. My dream would be to be able to take a single drop of blood from an individual and within a few hours, determine 100,000 single nucleotide polymorphism mutations in that individual, I shouldn’t say mutations but indifferences in that person’s genome. In other words develop an immediate genotypical profile for an individual that could be used in judging what treatments would be best for that individual or what possible genetic diseases that person might encounter in life. I think that’s coming, probably in the near future.
Richard Roberts: I guess the real point that you’re getting at here is that one would like to take individuals and get some idea of their genetic makeup. One way to do that is to get the complete DNA sequence, but in fact you can get a lot of information without looking at the complete DNA sequence because as a result of these things called single nucleotide polymorphisms, we know that approximately every 300 bases or so, along with human genome, there is a region that varies, quite often from one individual to another. By just looking at those regions, in essence just sampling a one three hundredth of the genome instead of looking at the whole thing, one can actually tell a lot about the genetic propensity of various people.
For instance, we know that there are genes that if they go wrong, if they have some particular polymorphism, they have one sequence as opposed to another, that that leads to problems and the first classic example of this was sickle cell haemoglobin where we knew that a single base change in the DNA sequence for haemoglobin rendered the haemoglobin not quite so effective. This was a mutation that had been well kept within the human population in Africa because when you had heterozygous for this condition, when you had one sickle cell gene and one normal gene, you had resistance to malaria which, if you live in Africa, this is quite an important thing to have. That has been maintained in the population, even though the selection no longer applies among blacks who have moved from Africa into the US or into England or into Western Europe and they maintain this mutation because evolution is slow, it takes a long time for it to get out of, and there are many diseases for which this kind of thing is true.";573;Advice  for young scientists
You mentioned the probability of finding an SNP /- – -/ that the human genomes that have been sequenced a body, say a single group and then the sphere group have been different and can you already now see evidence of SNPs if you compare your sequences with each other?;"Richard Roberts: Yes.
They shouldn’t be entirely equivalent, I would imagine.
Richard Roberts: No, basically what’s happened so far is that the main sequence that’s come from Celera is from one individual. There are other individuals who are being sequenced at Celera at a level sufficient to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms. The public human genome project, they have sequenced many individuals, a much larger number than Celera have been dealing with and so there are single nucleotide polymorphisms that are apparent within their data already and there is in fact something called the SNIP consortium which are a group of labs who are specifically looking for single nucleotide polymorphisms. These have been funded by both government agencies and by commercial companies and this data is all being placed in the public domain, so the answer is we know of a lot of snips already but we don’t know enough to do a complete genotype on someone.
Hamilton Smith: Nor do we know which of those snips really are clinically relevant, I mean the large proportion of them are probably pretty neutral changes. We don’t know how many would be medically significant or genetically significant.
Richard Roberts: But this is what will come out of the next stage of the human genome project where one tries to assign function and identify the genes, because many of these we know that these are important for this disease or for that, we will probably find homologs of some of these genes and we don’t know whether they’re important yet, so that will need to be tested. In many ways, we’re really at the beginning of the human genome project, not at the end, so even though we have announced we’ve gotten through this first stage, it very much is a beginning. Biology has undergone this revolution in the last few years where it’s gone from being really an observational science, in which people have been looking at phenomenon and trying to understand them and trying to figure out what was going on, to become a hard science like chemistry or physics where we can really now look at a complete genome and put some bounds on the problem. If we want to explain how a small bacterium works, we can say we’ve found there are 4,000 genes or 5,000 genes, we need to explain this organism in term of these 5,000 genes, if we’re going to do a genetic experiment in which we change one of these genes and we know what to look for, we know we have to look and see what happens to all of the other genes, in order to begin to understand. I think we’re very much at the start of biology, which is a wonderfully exciting time for us, you know I mean this is the time I would love to be a graduate student again, this is the time to be a graduate because there are many discoveries to make, many more Nobel Prizes coming out of this field.
Hamilton Smith: In science, one tends to go from simple to complex and then hopefully back to simple again. We’re in the complex phase right now.";573;Meaning(Values) of Work
But now, if you are a graduate student today looking for what to do during a career in biology and you see these large enterprises doing all the sequencing, so all the sequences will be available, you can’t get the PhD out of sequencing anything as an individual.;"Richard Roberts: We would hope not.
So your supervisor buys a licence maybe, to have the detailed sequence for a certain genome, so does that leave the individual graduate student then with trying to define the role of specific proteins or signalling systems?
Richard Roberts: That’s certainly one possibility. Basically what you have is this enormous textbook, except that instead of being a textbook with diagrams and clear headings telling you what everything is, you’ve got a textbook, it’s full of words but we don’t know what the headings are and we don’t know how to put in the diagrams to explain how this little bit relates to this little bit. This is for the graduate student to start to work out.
Hamilton Smith: Each gene with an unknown function is a PhD degree, if you can figure it out.";573;Advice  for young scientists
You start your autobiography writing these words “A sense of place was and remains an important part of my life” and I wanted just to ask you what did you mean by this sentence.;I mean by the sentence that I have always found that I am comfortable in identifying myself with certain special places. I grew up on a farm in Kentucky, a family farm, a small farm, and I identify with that place. I go back every year and it’s always relaxing and home. I worked at MIT for 30 years almost and it’s an outstanding institution, does tremendous research and education and I’ve been in the same office all that time. It’s a place, I go there, it’s one of those pleasant places that I have. So, I tend to identify with certain places and enjoy working there.;574;creativity
But MIT’s very far away from a farm.;Very far away from the farm and very different backgrounds, very different places and histories, but both special in the sense that one place it’s special, that was my place and then at MIT it’s a special place to do science and engineering. It’s a spectacular research institute.;574;Environment
So how come you did this big step from the farm to this institute?;It was a step driven by curiosity. I clearly did not want to spend my life being a farmer. I enjoyed the time when I was young, but it wasn’t intellectually stimulating and the world was very confined and as I looked out on the world and thought about what I would like to do, I would like to continue learning and science gave me the opportunity to continue learning, even today. As I flew across the Atlantic Ocean I was taking research papers written by colleagues in the field and learning from them and it’s just terribly enjoyable being able to understand in detail how other people think and how problems unfold and adding your own little bit to it and creating something new and that’s a wonderful life. It’s just an enjoyable way to spend one’s time.;574;Environment
When you look backwards can you see when one could, for the first time, see a Nobel Prize winner in the future in you?;"Oh, I had no idea about a Nobel Prize. When I was about 10 or 11, I started getting fascinated about science and mathematics and the area of study that I excelled at, other people admired my ability to do it and then as I rose through science and at each stage did well and moved to MIT I knew I was in a research community that was absolutely at the forefront of what was going on in the world and I had great colleagues in my environment to talk to about, you know, cutting edge research and there I began to do research that I knew was important. Now, there’s many, many great scientists out there who cannot be blessed by a Nobel Prize; there just aren’t enough around and never did I think I was going to necessarily see a Nobel Prize but I knew I was doing very good science and enjoyed that and that’s what life is about, it’s doing good science. If you’re a scientist that’s what you want to do and have people appreciate it. It’s wonderful when people appreciate it.";574;Impact of the Nobel on you
Yes, and this was genetics that you were in? You were two that got the prize, Richard Roberts.;Rich Roberts and his group worked at Cold Spring Harbor and my group worked at MIT and in parallel we made this discovery of the split gene structure.;574;Creativity
So you worked day and night? Was it the big race there?;We worked day and night. We didn’t actually know at the time we were both on the same thing. It was at the end when we started to talk to people about this new discovery that we realised that there was another lab who was talking about a new discovery too and as we got together and compared our results it was clear that we had come to similar conclusions at about the same time.;574;Creativity
The last announcement about HUGO, the human genome project, also revealed that we have much less genes that you were hoping for?;"I mean from a biologist’s point of view the fewer the better because we would like to understand how those genes function in the physiology of what makes us work as a human being and the estimate at the end of the day was that there are 35,000 genes.
Instead of 100?
Phillip Sharp: I use the term estimate because of this mosaic gene split structure, this split gene structure, it’s very difficult to identify those little bits of information that are genes.
Hidden in the garbage?
Phillip Sharp: They may be hidden in the garbage. There could be many other genes but even with the genes we know, because of this split gene structure, that a gene is split up into 10 or 20 different pieces, we now know that as the gene is expressed, different pieces of that gene can be joined together to make the protein, and this gives you the ability to use combinations in different cells in the body. For example, there’s been recently described the gene in the brain of a fruit fly, a simple fruit fly, one gene, and that gene has the ability to be expressed in 38,000 different proteins.
Because of the split genes?
Phillip Sharp: The split genes and alternative splicing, 38,000. There’s more variations in the way that gene can be expressed than there are genes in the whole genome. When we look at 35,000 genes we know more than half of them are alternatively spliced. We look at a complexity that’s much larger than 35,000. We’re looking at complexities of hundreds of thousands of possible variations in gene expression that could give rise to the complexity that you see in the different cells and different functions of our bodies. So, though we have what is thought to be 35,000 genes, we know that those 35,000 genes can generate a great deal more complexity than just 35,000 genes. But, even with 35,000 genes, if you take one here and one there and one there and one there and mix them in different combinations at different times you can make an enormously complex machine. So, we have a lot to understand yet in biology. The genome is not the end of biology. The genome is actually just the beginning of biology. It is going to set us on a whole new plane or rate of discovery that will make it fascinating for decades to come.";574;Future research
So what is the next challenge in biology do you think?;The next challenge in biology. Well, there’s so many challenges, and so little time. The challenges of how we are formed. We’re making great progress on how development of a complex organism such as ourselves, with skin and hair and all these other different tissues develop from the 35,000 genes. We’re going to understand that and that’s going to underwrite a lot of development of new drugs and treatment for diseases but then we look at the real challenge and ultimate challenge. There’s nothing that a human biologist would like to study more than the brain, the human brain. It’s a fascinating organ.;574;Future research
So this is a new field you’re moving into?;It’s a new field I’m moving into and I’m leading the development of institute at MIT but if you think about that as an area of science first you’ve got the biology and physiology and how the brain works. I mean that’s a fascinating substance unto itself but then as we understand more about how the brain functions and what’s the physiology and part of emotion and intuition and all these other things. It has implications for culture, it has implications for communication, it has implication for education, it has implications for economics. It’s just a wonderful interface between biology and the rest of society and culture. So I see, as one of the great challenges of the future, developing a more complete understanding of how the brain functions and how we modify it by our educational cultural experiences and use that to do creativity and that’s a fascinating field and I think young people are going to flock to it, it’s going to change us, the way we view ourselves, it’s going to change the way we view culture and history. It’s a wonderful field and I’m hoping by taking the responsibility of being director of a new institute at MIT to expand that field at MIT and get a lot of bright young people working on it and enthusiastically making progress.;574;Research
You’re also involved in a biotech firm since very long time ago. Biogen.;Biogen. I was very fortunate early on. I entered science just at the time of recombinant DNA so the early stages of my career recombinant DNA developed that I assume in my research programme the manipulation of DNA and this was a new tool and frequently when a new tool arrives in science it changes science and it certainly was the case for recombinant DNA. It gave us the ability to take DNA from different species and put them together.;574;Future research
When was it?;It was in the 1975-76-77 period in which that technology really became quite widely spread. I’d learned about it in the early 1970s and participated in it but then in 1976-77 we knew we had this technology, we knew we could make new pharmaceuticals and that they would benefit man and a group of scientists, myself and Wally Gilbert out of the US, Charles Weissmann and Bernard Mach out of Switzerland, Heinz Schaller and Peter Hofschneider out of Germany and Ken Murray and Brian Hartley out of England all got together and stared a company with a bunch of capitalists who gave us money to do it and the company’s called Biogen and it’s still a very significant biotech company. It’s located in Boston and there are some remarkable things that Biogen’s done. It holds the intellectual property patents for hepatitis B vaccine and most of the people in Europe and in the US and many parts of the world have been vaccinated with that vaccine. It holds the patent for alpha interferon and it’s one of the major treatments for hepatic infections from hepatitis B and C and it’s really changed a lot of people’s lives and it now is selling the major drug for multiple sclerosis called avonex. The first type of drug made interferon and several companies have it and Biogen’s the market leader, but it’s changed people’s lives because it gives a significant fraction of people better control of that disease, which is a horrible disease. I’ve been fortunate to being able to touch many people’s lives by having participated in developing a technology and then helping translate it into the private sector and then have it used to improve the quality of people’s lives around the world. So that’s been a great experience and I’ve learned a lot from that experience and how business works, how societies work and all those sorts of things and it was a tremendous time in science.;574;Research
In the context of genomic research there has been quite large criticism against commercialisation of science. What do you think about that?;In the genomics research there’s been this specific issue that we have human genome sequence and do we patent it and do we patent specific parts of it, how assessable to the scientific community around the world is this sequence going to be and I think the scientific community has come down on the side strongly that it will be available and that people will be able to do research with it. The other side is that to develop a pharmaceutical requires easily between $400 and $800 million.;574;Role of Science
From the basic research to the product?;"From the basic research to the approval for sales. Now those two numbers just appeared in the press in the US from a news study and it’s not important to go through the details; they’re both very large numbers and to be able to husband those resources, apply them and get new drugs requires the ability to use patents to recover those investments because you make the investments long before you actually sale. Now, I’m not justifying the industry. It’s a very profitable industry, there’s no question about, highly profitable industry but in addition it does deliver drugs, right, and most of the drugs that we use today, almost all of them without exception, they have been developed through that mechanism and I’m confident people will not make those types of investments without being able to patent and recover their investment with some profit after they make it. Now, societies are going to debate just what the amount of profits reasonable and how long those patents should be used for creating a monopoly but there have to be some mechanism to allow recovery of those costs.";574;Creativity
So this will be the future of biotechnology?;I mean that’s the way pharmaceuticals have been structured for the last decades and in biotechnology it will also be the case. Biotechnology is predicated on new science, new things happening so fast that large organisations find it difficult to incorporate those new things and I think the addition of the genome sequence and our abilities to use new ways of studying cells and physiology is going to mean that there’s going to be a continual rapid advance in biological science creating many opportunities and therefore biotech will continue to be a thriving subpart of the pharmaceutical world for at least a decade or more and will bring us new treatments for diseases and infections and other things.;574;Environment
Then the first question. How did you come into your research field and what were your initial steps in the field that lead you to your future career?;How I went into science, that came very early when I was about 15 years old, I had read books on Louis Pasteur and I decided I wanted to become a microbiologist, and I remember for my 16th birthday I asked, as a present, for a microscope and my brother who was at the Polytechnical school in Zürich bought in a second hand store, beautiful in fact, lights, the old lights microscope with a emersion objective. I wanted to solve all the problems of the world and this is how I went in fact into that field. Then when, before I went to the university, I went to see the professor in microbiology and he said: you know, there’s no money in microbiology. If you want to become a microbiologist you have to get a diploma of something, pharmacy or chemistry, pharmacy didn’t interest me so I went into chemistry and this is how I ended up.;575;Motivation
You finally came into the Nobel Prize laureate field and you did this 1992 in physiology or medicine for reversible protein phosphorylation. How did that feel?;It came as a big surprise. In fact I, I got a phone call in the middle of the night, my wife was a little bit ill so she was sleeping in another room and the phone rang and I grabbed it and somebody said ‘Dr Fischer’. The first idea was somebody wants to sell me a new roof on the house. I said ‘Yes’, he said ‘Are you Dr Fischer from the University Washington? I said ‘Yes, why does he’ … and he said ‘Congratulations, you just got the Nobel Prize’ and it had no reality. I said ‘I don’t believe it’, he said ‘Oh yes, believe it, you and Dr Krebs are sharing’, and the moment he mentioned Ed Krebs’ name since we had been working together for 40 years, it put everything in the right ball park, so that woke me up. I put the light on and it was 3.45 in the morning. It was CBS New York.;575;Impact of Nobel prize on you
That’s the usual time, because there is a time difference and this time difference from the decision to reaching the West Coast, US, makes that early in the morning for you. But I meant how did you come into exactly that field, because it must have been a long story before that too.;It came from the fact that Ed Krebs, my colleague, had been working with Carl Cori, the Cori’s in St Louis, on phosphorylase, muscle. We in Geneva, my mentor was Kurt Meyer and we had been working on potato phosphorylase and the muscle enzyme is activated as you well know by compound called AMP, adenylic acid, but not the potato one. The Cori’s thought it was a form of co-enzyme and I thought it can’t be because co-enzymes are preserved through evolution as you know better than anybody else. We decided to investigate the system and we started working, we thought we would be working for a few months on that and very rapidly we found that the enzyme was activated by a totally different mechanism. That’s how we entered the field of phosphorylation.;575;Creativity
And then you had a long series of discoveries, would you like to describe some of them you think are crucial?;That was the first, that the protein could be activated and inhibited by phosphorylase and dephosphorylation. When we worked in crude muscle extract there was an absolute requirement for calcium, but when we purified the enzyme there was no involvement of calcium and the question is why do we need calcium in the crude extract? There were a lot of our enzyme, phosphorylase, there was a lot of magnesium ATP required, why do we need calcium? The only possibility is that the enzyme, we knew it had to be an enzymatic reaction, we knew it had to be what we call a kinase, the only possibility was that kinase also existed in inactive and active form and calcium was involved in that and that turned out to be correct. That was the beginning of a cascade system, activation of an enzyme that activated another enzyme that breaks down glycogen.;575;Creativity
How do you feel now with something like 10% or whatever of all protein being regulated by phosphorylation? It must be a wonderful feeling to have found this first and then know that everything depends on it.;This is really serendipity. You know where you start in research and you never know where you will end up. This is the beauty of basic research and yes, now there’s an explosion of kinases and the very very big development in the field was the discovery just 20 years ago that a very important carcinogenic virus, Rous sarcoma virus, brings about tyrosine phosphorylation and involve tyrosine phosphorylation in transformation and oncogenesis. The field developed, at first people thought: Oh, it’s a nice system, but they are working on it why. Then when we found that calcium was involved that got all the muscle physiologists interested because muscle contraction is triggered. Then it was found that nerve conduction, phosphorylation, that got all the neurologists excited and then when it was found a transformation is brought about by tyrosine so that was the explosion.;575;Creativity
You feel that you have an incapacity to follow all the different fields?;Absolutely not. This is the importance of going to meetings, the importance of friends who call you. I’m retired now, in fact since seven years, but I closed my laboratory about three years ago and I’m delighted I have because now I can read science for the beauty of it without saying: Oh, I have to tell Al he should do that, I have to remember that. Now I just read science and follow science for the pleasure of it.;575;Career Devleopment
That’s very good. This matter with sociology on science, did the Nobel Prize change your life? Did you come into lots of committees, you’ve got other commitments?;"In many little ways, nice ways, I certainly can’t bitch about it. It has been an extraordinary experience, not only for me, but we have always been very very close friends with Ed Krebs, but more than that. The two families went to Stockholm, they have become close friends. Within my family they have become much closer, you know we are bound by this sort of a confrerie, brotherhood, if you want. It has been a really extraordinary experience. A little bit disturbing too. Disturbing because – and I was wondering why – you wonder you know why? Why were we selected? Somebody this morning spoke about that, science, you never do science alone. You do science with collaborators; the whole field is carried out by many many groups. We would have never been able to do what we did without very very bright collaborators. There is a difference between the Nobel Prize for instance and the gold medal in the Olympic games. For the Olympics you train like crazy for several years with one goal in mind, you compete, you beat all the other guys and by golly when they give you the gold medal you know why you got it. Not with the Nobel Prize.";575;Impact of the Nobel on you
But in some cases perhaps it may be different, in different fields. How much do you rate … I mean first there is experience, science has long tradition and lots of previous results and then you work hard and you have lots of collaborators but you also need that push, the creative environment and the creative realisation of yourself. How do you think first, what did you consider about that in your case and how can we promote it in general?;For me, I can tell you it was the love of science. Really that. The enormous pleasure, working in a lab, never knowing what you’ll get, getting extraordinary results that will prove wrong within a week, others that hold, it’s like reading a detective book, you try to follow some clues and try to build a story. I like the approach of making hypothesis and either trying to destroy them or to prove them and go this way, I like this approach.;575;Creativity
But most people have something they might wish to have changed, anything you would have changed?;No, when I went into science, I was at the conservatory in Geneva, playing the piano, and maybe there was some hesitation whether or not I should go into music. I would have never been able to become a concert pianist, you have to be a virtuoso at age 12, you know, like tennis players, and I was not, I didn’t have the virtue, but I would have probably become a conductor. I like music more than piano, but I don’t know, I felt that music, I should keep that for the garden, for the pleasure of it.;575;Future research
Do you see any connection between the music and science because you had this connection. The previous person I interviewed here had the same, Manfred Eigen, and my mentor Hugo Theorell had the same. Do you see any reason for this?;Manfred Eigen is a super pianist and a good friend. I don’t know, I did a lot /- – -/ with Jerry Edelman who is a very good violinist. I love chamber music, I love to accompany people who sings, lieder, but it sounded gross to me to make a living out of music, I view music as something that you don’t touch.;575;Creativity
If we should switch to support a little, how do you see the natural present-day support of science and the discussion that we just had in the lecture.;I have the same worries that were expressed. The fact that now more and more you go towards targeted research. There’s nothing basically wrong in targeted research, in fact many fundamental discoveries came through applied research as exemplified for instance by the work of Louis Pasteur. But nothing wrong as long as all the money doesn’t go towards targeted research. Unfortunately, many administrations have this erroneous feeling that you can solve a problem by throwing millions of dollar at it. They don’t understand what is creativity in science, they don’t understand that so many discoveries come from serendipity. Mendel didn’t know that he would find the laws of classical genetics by trying to solve why peas would grow white or pink or another colour. Or Röntgen, who was interested simply in looking at the properties of electrons bouncing on the cathode. He didn’t know he would make maybe the largest discovery ever made in the field of medicine. If either Mendel or Röntgen would have applied to, let’s say NIH if it existed at that time, there’s not a chance in a million that their work would have been approved.;575;Creativity
Perhaps we can end up with a question about the future. I guess you must have got it several times before Now you have had a successful scientific life, full of science, for 50 years or more, if you now go 100 years ahead, what would you think happen and which of the present-day questions are not solved or are all solved. A difficult question.;If you ask me what percentage I would go zero upon zero, zero, zero, zero, etc. A tremendous problem will have to be solved. To predict, even in 10 years, you cannot do that. As a friend of mine once said it’s like asking a general of cavalry in 1880 to plan for World War III. He would tell you: Give me ten thousand cavaliers and I’ll protect Washington. You cannot predict, you cannot guess what you cannot imagine. The big problems that will be solved rapidly is genetic therapy, therapeutics, because we begin to understand a little bit the regulation of genes, the tremendous problems. To say: Oh, we’ll solve that in 10 years, it’s nonsense, I don’t know when, but it will. I’m certain we will be able to regenerate nerves when nerves are cut. I am sure that we will be able to grow stem cells, in all cases aplastic anaemias and things like, replace that, so many therapeutic problems will be solved. In my field which is cell signalling, there are many pathways, we begin to know those pathways, we know all the enzymes that are involved but enzymes are words, we know bits and pieces of phrases, but we don’t know the language, a cell has to speak among pathways to co-ordinate all those reactions, we don’t know that language. More importantly we don’t know the language that the cell has to speak with another cell to co-ordinate the development of multi-cellular organisms where messages have to be sent back and forth from one cell to the other. This communication has been crucial to the establishment of the very complex networks of communication we have in embryonic morphogenesis in the immune system, in the brain where you have some more than a thousand million cells speaking with one another through something like 10 million billion synapses, ultimately leading to generation of thought, memory, consciousness. That’s one of the huge challenges that faces the biologists.;575;Future Research
I think you gave a very good answer to this difficult question, and you did it so well you’ll have another difficult question after all, and that is there are many ways of treatment, one is the genetic therapy for the future like you just said, there’s also transplantation. I was recently at the lecture where we were told all the benefits from transplantation, and I saw this drug treatments like using inhibitors and receptor agonists and so on. How do you see the future between these three fields, do you think we will soon be overtaken with genetic therapy or soon overtaken with transplantation?;I don’t think so. I think that we developed all three and you know you’ll use the one which is the more advanced at one particular time and have taken over. What is remarkable now is that we begin to understand some of the mechanics that control each of these, for drugs we begin to know how to model the drug, so the opportunity, the potential for advances in those three fields is immense. I think that the young people today have a marvellous future ahead of them in those fields.;575;Future research
Professor Erwin Neher, welcome. My first question would be about the lifestyle as a scientist. Is there a particular lifestyle?;During these days here in Lindau, I was asked several times by students: What do you do outside science and what other interests do you have? Of course I have other interests, but on the other hand, science is a lifestyle in the sense that it’s a combination of profession and hobby. What you like to do, I mean as a scientist you have the chance to combine these two things, you know, and I think in that way it’s a lifestyle. I mean you do what you like because you just follow your curiosity and you are happy when you find new things about nature, about how things work around us and inside us.;577;Free time
How old were you when you decided that this is the way you wanted to go?;It was pretty clear even when I was a little child that I was very interested in nature, in all these things that I observed and later in school I would think I was pretty much determined to say at the age of 15, 16, 17, first of all that I would try to study basic sciences, physics, chemistry and then also by the time I graduated from high school it was pretty clear that I wanted to do what at this time just was a kind of wake discipline which was not really established yet, biophysics, you know an interdisciplinary field between physics and biology.;577;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
What was the question you wanted to have answered?;Quite, quite specifically, I mean during my high school years I had a chance to read about the findings which were quite new at this time, the late 1950s, on the nerve conduction, on the generation of the nerve and pulses, electrical phenomenon which happens inside our bodies, in our nerve cells and I was fascinated by this fact because, I mean, I had this interest in biology on the one hand, on the other hand I knew from what I learnt at school that physics and chemistry about things which I understood well which was easy for me at school to cope with, you know, so to combine these two things in the form of biophysics was easy for me to do.;577;Creativity
You need to find like-minded people, I believe, as well you found friends and even I believe your wife in the field of science?;Yes, that was of course much later. I did meet my wife in the laboratory which is part of her lifestyle you know, and of course over the years I had many friendships which developed in the lab which were connected to our work of course and so part of this lifestyle of a scientist is that you do a lot of travelling that you have friends all over the world which you first learn to know by means of your work, but then they become friends and wherever you go you have friends and you don’t go as a tourist to some place but you have friends and these friends tell you much better than a tourist guide can do what the specialties of a given location are.;577;Advice for female scientists
Professor Sakmann of course is still a friend and a colleague that you eventually made this fantastic discovery with, how did it come about?;"This is a story which comes in two steps: While I was doing my PhD in Munich at the Max-Planck-Institut for Psychiatrie, he also was doing his PhD in a different department on a different floor of the same building, but we met each other and we realised that we had joint interests. I came from the physics field, he came from medicine, he was a medical student at this time. He was very interested in this more physically oriented things which were going on in the laboratory where I was, which was run by Dr Lux, who also was a medical person but very deep into the quantitative description of things and quantitative methods. So when we met three years later at Göttingen again it was immediately clear that we would try to collaborate because he in between had been in London working with Bernhard Katz.
I changed from Munich to Göttingen, doing a kind of detour for two years or so into more physical chemistry. Our Institute in Göttingen is called the Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical chemistry, which means a combination of all three of them, and so I went to Göttingen to learn about the currents of recordings of channel currents in artificial systems, more physicochemical approach to these things. We had already developed ideas in Munich about recordings in the channels in biological cells, you know, but this more or less were put back for some time so that I would have the chance to more or less practice with these less complicated physical or artificial systems.
… this combined was clear to the two of us that it should be a good start point for a collaboration …
Then when Bert Sakmann came from London joining the same institute where I was again in a different department, we got together again. He meanwhile had obtained tremendously valuable experience for that purpose of recordings in channels. Bernhard Katz lab where he learned how to isolate the cells of the neuromuscular junction, the muscle cells and the nerve cells which make this connection where he learned to enzyme treat these preparations so that they would have clean surfaces. With his expertise on the cells and my expertise on the recording currents and dealing with pipettes also, this combined was clear to the two of us that it should be a good start point for a collaboration and that should give us a good chance to tackle this problem which was one of the problems which was in the minds of quite a few researches at this time can one record discreet steps in current when single channels open and close.";577;Creativity
And you developed this little glass pipette;Yes. I had been dealing with little glass pipettes in my PhD project, I mean the little glass object is not very special in physiology. Microelectrodes, pipettes drawn out to very fine tips you know, were standard in electrophysiology since the late ’40s I think. The problem was that this and the techniques of this time which recorded currents or electric little signals in biologic tissue use these very fine microelectrodes to penetrate the cells. What we did differently was that we in fact made these pipettes a little bit larger, the openings were larger, not designed to penetrate but just designed to place them on top of the cells to isolate a small patch of membrane for the purpose of electric measurement without destroying it, you see.;577;Creativity
And when you did this and when you got the results, how did you react, the two of you, what did you do when you realised?;"Of course we were quite happy but, this didn’t come as in all or nothing things suddenly a … it did take about two years or so you know, during which we step by step improved things. There are certain ways to record signals and to analyse them which doesn’t actually require the single individual steps to be seen, but also when you just do not have the resolution to do that, but have a situation where many such steps superimpose the responses from many channels are recorded together. You have a kind of characteristic fluctuations you see in the current and for years we just analysed these fluctuations which allowed us to infer from these how big these steps actually are supposed to be which we want to measure.
So having this done and made the pipettes smaller and smaller, we finally approached the situation where there was this noise, but now and then you could see some step-like thing which very much looked like the steps that we wanted to see. Then of course one day or other it was a little bit better, a little bit worse and there were certainties, some days where we thought that’s it, you know, and now we are convinced that we see these tiny signals and this was maybe ’74 or so. Then we gradually improved until we came to the point where we not only believed that the steps were there, but where we also dared to publish them.";577;Creativity
And then to me, not being a scientist at all, I understand that there must have been times when it was very difficult and maybe one of you wanted to give up and the other said no come on let’s go ahead …;Yes, yes, of course there were times when it seemed that we had done everything we could and we couldn’t do it better and still we wouldn’t see this dent, little things. And there were frustrations and as I said at one point we got a little bit frustrated and we took this other project with measuring these fluctuations just to assure ourselves that actually there is something which signified the presence of /- – -/ of these channels and this was it. But apart from that, it was pretty a step by step thing you know, without major frustrations.;577;Creativity
How important was it to be two then to sort of encourage each other;Oh I think it was important yes, I mean, first of all because we could put together our experiences which were in very different fields you know, and then also because maybe one might have been more easily distracted you know to … maybe the distraction might have lead to a fast response but maybe also it would have prevented the success, you never know.;577;Creativity
You have to be very open minded and very hard working I believe.;Hard working, yes, definitely and open minded in a sense that we dared to just try new approaches which nobody else does you know.;577;Competencies
When you now look at what you have achieved, are you happy in the way it has been used?;"Very happy. In fact we think the way it has been used, the way it developed without our active participation actually was what won us a Nobel Prize you know. I mean on the one hand there is just the finding, well one can resolve these step-like changes which more or less prove the concept of ion channels, that there are ion channels, this by itself of course would have been a nice finding which would have been hailed by many of the colleagues. But what turned all this that given this new technique the improvement of ways how to look at channels that many colleagues took up this method you know, and so it was a powerful tool in the hands of hundreds and thousands of colleagues.
And through this work, all over the world, it turned out that channels are not only in these cells that we started, I mean when we started, started channels we thought they were a special thing which happened to nerve cells, which happens in muscle and maybe some gland cells.People tended to divide living cells into excitable cells and non-excitable cells and excitable cells are of course a minority in the body, and we definitely thought that channels were only important for excitable cells. But what turned out that you find these channels, I mean different types of channels in all kinds of cells, liver cells and the blood cells, and the white blood cells and the kidney cells, even in plants, you know. And they do the most diverse jobs, they could fill the most diverse functions in these different cell types and that’s a real impact that our discovery and this new method had in the science, and I think this is what won us the prize.
… it turned out that these channels are very important targets for drugs …
Another aspect which again is a quite unanticipated aspect is that it turned out that these channels are very important targets for drugs. This lies a little bit in the nature of channels I mean, channels have not so many in a given cell, there are maybe thousand molecules of this kind of this channels but their function is to control the cell you know, to regulate the function. And if you think about it, such a molecule then is a good target for a drug because you need only a few drug molecules to block these channels, and though you just influence the workings of the whole cell end. And due to this intrinsic property it turned out that channels are the targets of some of the drugs which have been used over the years to treat hypertension you know, diuretics, psycho-active drugs, all kinds of drugs turned out to be drugs which act on these channels.";577;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Which one didn’t know at the time, when one created. Having made this discovery, do you think scientists like you have some kind of moral responsibility in which way your discovery is used?;That’s a difficult question of course, I mean if we see potential harm, potential dangers, of course we have the responsibility to point this out you know, to warn against that. On the other hand one of course thinks that any new knowledge, any better understanding of the matter around us, in us, will give means to handle things and normally of course one would think that people use these things to handle things better of course a scientist can never safeguard against new knowledge to be used against other people you know. It used to be harmful I mean, this started with the invention of the hammer, now you can use the hammer to do useful things, to build a house and you can use a hammer to kill somebody else.;577;Creativity
Is that a debate that goes on though, among the scientists?;Yes, yes, this debates, and I mean that more or less this issue rests at the basis of the whole problem on whether what we are doing is good or wrong you know, if you, it’s morally a question on what do you think about mankind. Do you trust in your fellow citizens in a sense that whatever they will have in additional tools they will use in balance more to the good or more to the bad. If you think they will use it more to the bad, you shouldn’t do science you know.;577;Environment
My last question Professor. We started off talking about lifestyle and you said it is really a lifestyle, but you also said you have other interests. What are you doing to relax and to just wind down probably from the lab work?;"What I’m doing to relax, some reading, some music, just being at home with my family, many things but unfortunately time  is always very limited because science not only is both a job and a hobby but it also consumes the time which usually spent on both of these issues.
Creative work, basically.
Erwin Neher: Hopefully.";577;free time
Why is that and what benefit has it given you?;"We are talking about what happened over the many years after the Nobel Prize was awarded and many years after we did the initial work for which we got it so we are talking about the last maybe 6-7 years and it is the common interest, you know, in order to find out how a synapse, you probably know what a synapse is, how synapse works. We have been looking for a new preparation. We found it, we established the way how to look at it.
… there’s still a very close personal friendship, which is mostly driven by, you know, curiosity …
Erwin had other techniques available, like release of calcium from cage compound and it was only natural that we start to collaborate again on a topic that both of us find very interesting and which had basically nothing to do with what we did 20 years ago, or 30 years go. So I don’t know whether this answers your question, but what I want to say is there’s still a very close personal friendship, which is mostly driven by curiosity, find out how things work.";578;Creativity
Is it important to share your findings with other scientists and with students?;"There is always a competition and one wants to share results once they’re published and this is good practice, it’s got to be and in our case it worked out very nicely because the results which you get have to be validated by as many laboratories as possible. In science very often they are singular achievements and it has been taken many years to validate them so other people could repeat them and the faster this happens the earlier you can proceed,  you can proceed in looking into other questions and people will take you seriously.
So once it’s published you should do everything to make the result and all the techniques involved available to other people but as long as you’re in the process of following an idea, first of all you have to have an idea, then you follow it. You find out whether you can falsify it or whether it is true and then publish it. I wouldn’t share too many results with immediate competitors but in the case of Erwin and myself we are a team from the very beginning because we did experiments together. I mean sitting together at the experimental set up and taking shifts.";578;Creativity
Did you support each other during those years of working very hard, when somebody felt a little bit despair or down the other one could support the other person?;I must say in this respect Erwin is just unique because he never got excited or despaired. He has what we would call in Germany, ‘Bayerische bierruhe’. I’ve never seen Erwin, these 30 years, getting excited about things which are not related to science. I mean he gets very excited about science but not about external facts. So this had a very good influence on our comfortability or whatever you call it because he was so quiet and didn’t get excited by people, saying bad things or, you know, there are many things that happen in the lab.;578;Creativity
Because there could be many hiccups and people who don’t believe in the work that you’re doing as well. I’m thinking about young students today, what qualities do they have to have to be able to continue, particularly as funding is getting more scarce?;"Well, you know, it’s easy to say this in retrospect but at the time when we started to collaborate in the 1970s you could still do quite elaborate experiments with a relatively little funding. Most of our money at the time was spent in developing tools, the tools which we developed in order to achieve our goal and verify the idea of ion channels elementary currents.
That’s a little glass …
… we had limited funding and this can be a benefit …
Bert Sakmann: Well, it’s not one of the glass pipette, it’s getting the right preparations that is frog muscles, you have to innovate a frog muscle you have to get the electronics, you have to have micro manipulators, you have to have a table that is almost completely free of vibrations. So in retrospect we had a relatively large investment in the beginning into, so to speak, our tools but then the consumables, the cost for the consumables were rather low, which is the opposite in many cases nowadays that you spend a lot of money on chemicals like restriction enzymes or things that are being sold by the industry and the industry wants to make money. So to summarize is we had limited funding and this can be a benefit even because you think of how you can solve a problem without spending too much money.";578;Advice  for young scientists
A lot of discussions have been around the need for basic research. What is your opinion because it seems like a lot more research is now coming towards should be applied science?;"I think this is a, I would say, European attitude because the European science politicians are not the most enlightened in the world.
Why not?
Bert Sakmann: This is what I was trying to ask Professor Marcus today why is there this difference between the States and Europe and I would exclude England from Europe because they still have an Anglo-American tradition in investing into basic science. I mean I shouldn’t complain, in Germany we still have the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft but the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft is just the top of the whole science enterprise and it would be nice if basic science would be more funded at the universities because this is where the students are being educated and we cannot do research without well educated students.";578;Meaning(Values) of Work
It seems like there’s then, as you say, this brain drain could lead to the scientific world here in Europe sort of becomes weaker and we don’t develop new methods.;That’s what’s happening. I mean despite what we hear from the politicians, especially from our present government, that they want to invest into science I think this is all, you know, hot air if I may say so, which I don’t know what the motives are but on the one side there is this appreciation of basic science, on the other side it’s been cut away in favour of applied science and my speculation is that politicians can’t think ahead more than two years this will have an effect in 5-10 years, it has already an effect. We will be completely dominated by American science has happened and this will happen.;578;Roles of Science (Scientists)
You have changed field partly and now looking more into the brain. Would you describe that in a way that we can understand? What are the issues that you really would like to get to at the moment by doing this research?;"My goal, so to speak, is to understand how the brain, based on the change of experience, let’s say training or the lack of training, changes instructed such that the brain can perform a new task. Is this simple enough? You might say what are the mechanisms that underlie learning, ok. Now this can be described at a phenomenological logical level. Say you do this and this and then the brain will react like this, but the effect of all this is based on the change of the interaction of particular molecules and that’s what we want to find out; a change in brain structure induced by a difference in your external world that we can explain in molecular terms, and the structure that we have chosen is the cortex. This is sort of a mantle that covers the whole brain because there’s good evidence that most of these functions, the ability to learn, are located in the cells of the cortex and to be more specific there’s also good evidence that the changes in cortical organisation induced by change in experience are based on the change in the structure of particular contact points, which are referred to as synapses.
So my research at present is directed to understand the change in cortical structure at the level of synapses. What is happening when the brain has a new ability, how do the cells reconnect? How stable is this, is this happening for a period of days, for hours, for years? Does it come back? I mean the whole process of learning, if you may say so, or of development, is very well described at the phenomenological level but what we need to know is which molecules are involved in that.";578;Meaning(Values) of Work
Now it’s also the discussion about genes and what is controlling, for example, different diseases. Partly through mass media, I think the public in general has got the impression that by the knowledge we now have about the gene set up that things would be more easy, for example treating certain diseases. Is that so or is the situation much more complex?;Maybe I’m a bit provocative but serious scientists never believed this sort of propaganda that came out of part of the molecular biology establishment. This was, you know, driven by too much publicity and I must say some of the molecular biology establishment has really overdone this, maybe in conjunction with the media but I think every serious scientist never thought it would be that simple. I only hope that the false promises that were made for gene therapy, the promises that were made for what we learn, I mean not what we learn academically, but what we will benefit from the genome and what we will benefit from stem cells are formulated a bit more cautiously so that the public does not get the impression science is driven too much by PR. I think it’s a bit of a problem and it also attracts the wrong people to science.;578;Creativity
And the risks that have been so much debated over the last number of years. Do you see that with the gene technology? Super humans or so on.;"With respect to interfering in a rational way I think we are not 100 years, we are 500 years away. So this is completely overstated by people who have very different interests in, how do you say, hitting at molecular biology. I think these are scenarios which are so far away from reality that one doesn’t have to take them seriously but there are other more serious problems; who has access to information on your genome. In those cases there is indeed a single gene defect causing a disease, you know, I mean there are big successes in what you would call molecular medicine. So far this has been mostly on a rather limited fraction of diseases where you have one gene disease and there indeed I can see that rules have to be established but I think this can be done. I don’t think it’s going to be too difficult to establish proper rules.";578;Roles of Science (Scientists)
Your discovery certainly have made it more easy to find out about how the system works and how the diseases are part of this. What makes you most proud of your discovery if you look back at what you have achieved?;This was an unexpected benefit let’s say. There is a new class of diseases that came up in the last, yes I would say 10 years, they are called channelopathies. This means diseases related to defects in the function of ion channels and all of a sudden ion channels and electrical signals, which we’re not very popular for the general public because it’s somewhat difficult to understand how electrical signal comes about and that we all run on electrical signals but this development of finding channelopathies is quite, you know, rewarding I would say although I would have to say the major impact is not that we can look at ion channels, we can look at their defects but without the parallel development of molecular biology this would not have been possible. So you are now in a situation to be able to screen for defects in ion channels and you can, using our methods, find out what is really wrong with the function or what is not functioning properly.;578;Creativity
On a more personal level, both you and your wife are hardworking scientists. Have got any advice, I mean how is it possible to combine these two, you know, in a fast track life that so many people are living? Do you have time for leisure? Do you have time to structure your thoughts and go on?;The leisure for many, many years were our children . I mean we had two things which was work and family and nothing else . I mean you just have to take compromises and we felt that having children is so exciting that there’s no room for anything else.;578;Career Devleopment
I have the pleasure of sitting here with professor Joseph Murray, who won the Nobel Prize in 1990 for his work on organ transplantation. If I can start this little talk and say that from studying and from learning to know you it is quite clear that medicine was always a primary choice and that it was clear that you would become a physician from very early on. My first question is really when was it clear that you would be a researcher as well, what stimulated the early interest in research in you?;I think at Medical School the professors were doing interesting work. I remember one professor of pathology, he was really an instructor in pathology, was studying inflammation. I would look in the microscope with him and see different cells under different circumstances. I remember the trichina had ear centrefolds around it and an infection would have polymorphs. I wondered how the body attracted one, rather than another, and of course this is caused by xylocaine. We know now but this was back in 1941 and there was no knowledge of intercellular reactions. That interested me and then it was reinforced in my World War II experiences when we used skin from dead persons to cover burns in patients. We knew that the skin would last, survive, for maybe three weeks or four weeks but eventually it would melt away, whereas if his own skin had been used, the skin would have grown and then permanently survived and actually grown. I wondered how the body could be so smart as to distinguish between a piece of skin which to you and me would look the same, would treat one differently from another. Those were the two biological observations that were in the back of my mind.;579;Motivation
You came to the Valley Forge [Valley Forge General Hospital] shortly after you graduated from Harvard, I suppose, and got a lot of clinical experience I would say immediately.;Yes, we had battle casualties from all theatres, the European, African and the Pacific. We also cared for German prisoners of war, Italian and Italian prisoners of war as well in the same hospital and they received the exact same treatment.;579;Creativity
Problems associated with transplantation, the first one of those that you saw was the burns treatment and the difficulty in transplanting skin from unrelated individuals. I suppose a few years earlier there had been skin transplantation between identical twins.;Yes. that was 1934 or -35. A plastic surgeon in St Louis treating burns found that if skin came from relatives, it would survive longer than if it came from an unrelated person. He quite reasonably felt that if a related person has better survival, maybe an identical twin would have better survival and he found a pair of identical twins and cross skin grafted them and he got permanent survival. That was the only type of survival that we knew in the 1930s.;579;CPS
What was the process between the burns treatment in the Valley Forge and the kidney transplantation? How did you focus on kidney and kidney transplantation?;"It was quite logical. When I finally got out of the army and I finished my residency in the late 1940s I joined the kidney transplant team at the Brigham. It was already in operation. I joined them and rather than transplanting skin, it was more fun to transplant kidneys because you had the vascular anastomosis to do the ureter plantation and you could tell when the kidneys start functioning. It was a natural transition to use a kidney as a biological indicator rather than a piece of skin, but our research used both skin and kidneys throughout.
Was the animal experimentation, the transplantation in dogs, was that going on already when you arrived?
Joseph E. Murray: No, but I started a large series of dog transplants, also with mice, rabbits, all sorts of animals.
Based on that you performed the first transplantation between the identical twins.
Joseph E. Murray: Yes, in the course of operating on dogs, I figured if we didn’t have a good operation that would work in genetically similar persons, it would be no use and so I developed a surgical technique in dogs that was reproducible and could function normally. I had a whole group of dogs surviving on one transplanted kidney back to himself. It was an isogenic transplant but there was no genetic barrier.
Then of course a big jump or the major development was going from the identical twins to genetically unrelated people.
Joseph E. Murray: Yes, but before that we had to show that in man, the identical twin transplant would work.
Right.
Joseph E. Murray: We happened to get a set of identical twins, one of whom was dying of kidney disease, the other healthy. That took about two years to work it out against the ethics and the morals and the acceptance of the community. We went to doctors at other hospitals, we consulted clergymen of all denominations, we went to corporate executives to try to get a feeling for what the general public would feel about it because we were weak. We knew we were doing something experimental and we just wanted to inform as wide a variety of society as possible.";579;Future research
When was the breakthrough coming, would you say, with immune suppression that would …;The real break came with the development of drug immunosuppression. However, we had had some success both in animals and in humans with total body radiation and we had one set of brothers with a permanent kidney survival with an allogeneic kidney, treated with x-ray therapy. We started to do a series of 12 humans and one did very well, several did well for a while but then they would, after five or six weeks, would reject the kidney. We needed something more predictable and fortunately at that time the drug 6-mercaptopurine and it’s derivative as the azathioprine came along. That was synthesised, as you know, by doctors Hitchings and Elion from Burroughs Wellcome and they were very helpful to us. They sat in with us, educated us about biochemistry, they saw our patients, they knew our dogs by names, and soon we had long term surviving dog kidneys /- – -/.;579;Creativity
It’s very interesting to hear because I’ve learned from you that you had regular visits, I think, by Medawar early and then you were long standing collaboration with Hitchings and Elion. My question is did you have to stimulate our colleagues, our immunology colleagues to come or was it obvious, did you have to recruit them so to say?;"That’s a wonderful question because our local immunologists were not interested. They tolerated our interest they’d say: Joe you can’t do it, why don’t you wait until we solve the problem, but they did not attempt to discourage me, they just said, It won’t work. It wasn’t until Peter Medawar, who visited frequently, come to our lab, he would see some of our patients in the hospital and he was /- – -/ that a group of clinicians especially surgeons were interested in the biological problem. I think that he came to Harvard Medical School to give a series of lectures and he spent quite a bit of time in our lab and the immunologist wondered why.
I see.
Joseph E. Murray: A prophet is without honour in his own country. Once we got going and showed some good laboratory results our own immunology department became supportive. But an important thing was, we had the support of our chiefs of the clinical service. The chief of medicine was really behind it, Dr Thorn and Dr Moore achieved the surgery, supported us in every way including finances and so we developed a nice fine team.";579;Creativity
Coming back to the theme of today’s panel discussion which was extremely interesting, I would like to ask you, as we know that some people objected to the development of medicine and surgery at the time, did you experience much opposition, like people came up and told you that one shouldn’t do such things as transplant organs between different individuals?;Both yes and no. Some of my closest friends at the medical school faculty – I was young then just got out of the army – advised me not to get involved because they said it would ruin my career, but others were supportive and the ones that gave some warning didn’t forcefully stop me, they warned me in a friendly way.;579;Motivation
I guess, as you have said, it was very important that the first operation was successful.;Absolutely. We had done the operation in dogs many times successfully, but when the twins came, it had to work. We didn’t know whether the exact anatomy of the human was going to be receptive to a transplant kidney, so we went to the pathology department during a post mortem exam about a week or so before the operation and transplanted a kidney in the anatomy lab. All the way through from the beginning to the end, we wanted to be sure the blood vessels would work well, the ureter would fit into the bladder and so we prepared as well as we could.;579;Creativity
Your own career shows the importance very clearly in terms of the collaboration between clinical research and pre-clinical research and the fact that we can work together. I know that you have been a prophet for that ever since. I think a problem that exists in many medical universities and medical schools is to get enough collaboration between the pre-clinical scientists and the clinical scientists.;For today’s panel we had a breakfast meeting a few days ago and one of the persons in the panel, I won’t mention who, very fine person, said that a physician can never be a scientist. I didn’t say anything, but I don’t know how they define scientist unless it’s somebody who doesn’t work with patients. I hear that all the time and I have been a prophet of clinical investigation because people ask me why did we keep on when there were so many failures. It was the patients who were dying and most of them were young in their early twenties. The families knew that we were experimenting and even though they didn’t expect success, they said, It may not help us but it may help someone in the future. It gave me an indication of the wonderful generosity of human nature.;579;Creativity
That is really wonderful. Staying for a moment with pre-clinical and clinical medicine I would ask you something that relates to the Nobel Prize and some discussion which comes out now and then and which was obvious in some of the journeys last year. That is a question of pre-clinical prizes or prizes to basic science vs prizes to clinical science and to clinical medicine. I think that many of us have a feeling that it would be very nice to be able to give more prizes to clinical medicine. Do you think that clinical medicine is sometimes neglected in this respect?;Yes, I definitely do. I think Pasteur has a wonderful quotation that there is only one science, basic science and clinical, and they are locked together like the trunk of a tree to the branches. All forms of seeking knowledge, and I think that when a person feels that he or she must be in the laboratory to make scientific progress is stultifying their vision. I feel very strongly that we in the clinical side have certain advantages because we see patients, who have problems that need solving, that the bench scientist is never going to see. I feel very strongly that it would be a great loss to society if clinicians were not also research minded.;579;Creativity
Professor Sir James Black, welcome to this Nobel interview. The Nobel Prize that you were awarded in 1988 was kind of unusual I would say, you got the prize for the discoveries in drug research, and this was the first prize in this area in 31 years. Were you very surprised when you got the news?;"You bet that.  Astonished.  Yes, I didn’t think it was prize worthy frankly.
 No? Do you think it was?
Sir James Black: I have no way of judging that.  I mean I just played the cards that someone dealt me.";583;Impact of Nobel on you
But the drug that you have worked on is broadly spread today, it is beta-blockers from the beginning, everybody knows what it is.;"Yes, but you see my notoriety is by an accident, the accident is that the drugs I developed made a lot of money.  Now the science could have just been the same and the drugs might not have made much money and then I wouldn’t be here.  I’m not here for the science; I’m here because of the notoriety of the widespread use.";583;Meaning (Values) of Work
Why do you think so? Don’t you think that the development of drugs, there is commercial interests in it …;The citation was for a new method and that’s true in this sense that it so happened that when I got the idea for my first drug a discovery had been made and the discovery was that we have hundreds of messenger molecules that make our cells work together, we call them hormones. The discovery was that these messenger molecules have two properties, a property of, a cognition property, they recognise a cell which has a sight on it that they can, so there’s recognition and then they do some things to switch it on.  The discovery was that these two properties, cognition and efficacy were separable. I wanted to stop the effects of adrenalin on the heart and so I reckoned maybe I can take adrenalin and get rid of its efficacy and leave behind the affinity which in essence was what happened.;583;Environment
But don’t you think that most of the discoveries are kind of a surprise even for the discoverer?;It’s hard to go back, you know, we take memories and we smooth them like pebbles so we’re comfortable with them and I think memory isn’t about recollection, it’s about reconstruction and so I’m not at all sure now, at this stage, what I was actually thinking or planning or doing, all I know is outcomes and … But motives are very hard to be sure about.;583;Creativity
You have worked both for the university and for companies, industries … / How do you they compare?;About half my life in each. / I have worked as an employee for three drug companies and I have collaborated with a fourth and these companies are like people, they have quite different cultures, characters, but like people they have common diseases.  I once thought I’d write a textbook of institutional pathology and the diseases are largely problems of magnitude, problems of communication. A technical company is very people intensive, it’s not something that you can scale up with the equipment and machinery, you have to have a lot of people and when you have a lot of people, you have the problems of communicating between them so that’s the industrial side.  It’s very hard to make a general statement about companies because they’re all different.  Universities on the other hand, the problem with universities is they have been changing continuously during my association with them …;583;Environment
In what way?;… and I’m not too comfortable about the way we’re going, because more and more, the big universities, are becoming like companies, more and more they’re concerned mainly with the cash flow, more and more are they concerned with whether or not the intellectual output of the people can be turned into property and start-up companies, spin out companies, there’s huge obsession with making money and I don’t think this is compatible with the job of a university.  The job of the university is to make discoveries, not to make inventions.  Discoveries are about finding out something which, if you like, is already there but no one knew, whereas an invention … When I made a drug, that was an invention, there hadn’t been anything there before, but the invention was built on other people’s discoveries.  If Ray Ahlquist and so on had not done their work, I couldn’t have done mine. So the job of academia is to make discoveries, it’s the job of business to make inventions I think and so I’m unhappy about this. One of the worrying things today is that scientists, because of pressure on them to raise money, either from grants or from private venture capital, are making promises, you know, once we get the protein, once we know it’s structure, once we get the gene, then we’ll get the drug. This is unwise because we’re leading the public, who ultimately are our paymasters, we’re leading them to have expectations.  Now if …;583;Environment
So you’re afraid of a blacklash …;"I am afraid of this. If I was running a business and was making my shareholders promise like that they’d have me in prison, but scientists can get away with it. We’ll not get away with it forever, time will catch up with us because here’s the problem. The rate of accumulation of knowledge, the information, is so vast, none of us can take it in, but knowledge just adds, and you might think that all this knowledge will make progress but progress isn’t based on knowledge, it’s based on ideas, and whereas knowledge adds, ideas have to substitute. You have to replace the idea you already have with a new one and that’s painful and that’s slow and that is the rate limiting stamp.  For example we’ve had now the human genome project, that has taken 125 years from the time when chemists were extracting material from spermatozoa, from the nucleus and getting out this gooey stuff and then showing there was four bases in there, that was in the 1870s, staying right through now to get a nearly complete map of the sequence of bases in the human genome but that’s, it’s just not even the beginning of the story because now the problems are conceptual.  Suddenly we find there’s only about a third of the genes we expected, and we don’t know how they work. The big problem …
Why and what and …
Sir James Black: … and this is going to be the slow thing, our exploitation of the knowledge about the genome is going to require changes in our conceptions from what they are at the moment.  At the moment we are still thinking that our gene does our job and so if you can find out the job the gene does, why you can control it, but it isn’t going to be like that.
No, it sounds too simple.
Sir James Black: It’s too simple.
So even if you get more money for thinking the process will take time anyhow …
Sir James Black: Yes.
… even if more people will do it?
Sir James Black: There are some problems you cannot solve just by throwing money at them.  AIDS for example, we’ve been trying for what 25 years to get a vaccine for AIDS, so far we’ve failed.  Now we’ve been making vaccines, you know, for a century.  We want a vaccine, so we throw money at it and we’ve failed and we have to learn from these things that the wish is not enough, there has to be the understanding which is the platform for achieving what you want to do.
Yes, the creative process takes time.
Sir James Black: And the time, the slowness, is the thinking, the concept, that’s the hard bit.";583;Creativity
Has your life changed after winning the Nobel Prize?;"There is a period when it’s hectic, yes.
And you become an official person …
Sir James Black: And the problems are we’re not trained, we don’t know how to handle it, we’re not film stars.
No. How did you manage?
Sir James Black: Badly.
And that means?
Sir James Black: It means I had to make a lot of rather messy compromises I suppose, compromises between doing what other people wanted me to do and doing what I wanted to do which was to get on with my work. One of the things people want you to do in this sort of ‘star business’ is give lectures, attend seminars and so on and I just happen not to like it. I have one thing I enjoy and that’s sitting in a room with maybe 10-15 young graduate scientists and just talking. Then I’m happy, but these stand-up lectures I don’t like.";583;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I understand. So what was the problem that you were working on that was known since 1905?;"What I’ve been doing is I gave you the principle earlier and I just keep applying that principle, that’s why I’ve applied that to adrenalin, to histamine, to another small molecule called 5-hydroxytryptamine and then to a bigger molecule cholecystokinin and gastrin, but the principle is always the same.  These molecules are messenger molecules, they do things, so I recognise each of them as being a messenger molecule because I have a piece of tissue or something which responds to them characteristically, that is I have an assay. I have the assay, I have the hormone, I expose one to the other and the system does something, it may secrete, contract or … I take this molecule and I walk around it, look at it and think, Well now, maybe if I take that piece off, maybe that will get rid, see. I make this new molecule and now I compete the hormone molecule with my new molecule and … First of all I try it on its own, does it do anything?  Then I compete them. It’s an iterative process, it’s like Darwinian evolution only I synthesise, I test, I re-synthesise and on we go.
The one thing which is certain is it’s slow and this is why, in the drug industry today, this method which I have described and which everybody who’s tried it, it always works, you just don’t know how long it’s going to take. The beta-blockers was six years, histamine antagonist was nine years, 5-HTP was eight years, these are long periods. The drug industry has become inpatient, and it has now, if you like, got rid of this method which works and they’ve replaced it with a method which they don’t know yet if it’s going to work and this is now technological advances. We can now screen a hundred thousand molecules a day against proteins in one can or another, we have the technology to make hundreds of thousands of molecules, we have the technology to screen for them and what they’re looking for are leads, a molecule which does something.  I never start a project without a lead and yet it still takes me these long periods of time. At the moment the drug industry has doubled its expenditure on research and development in the last ten years and the productivity as judged by newer drugs coming out has fallen by a fifth.  This is not sustainable, and this is the thing, our earlier conversation about can you force drug discovery just by throwing money at it?  The evidence is you can’t. There was a very well-known American philanthropist, but he was a psychiatrist, a scientist, he had trained as an artist, he became a great collector of paintings, gave them all to the Met eventually, but near the end of his life he summed his life up by saying that art is a passion pursued with discipline. Science is a discipline pursued with passion; passion is the engine of science and if you haven’t got that then give it up.";583;Creativity
I’d like to start, if I may, by exploring your scientific beginnings a little and I don’t know where they began so I don’t know where to start, but perhaps at University of Pennsylvania where you read chemistry and then did an MD. Did you know at that time that you were set to become a serious scientist?;"It’s an interesting story, it goes back even before that. I trace my interest in science to when I was 13 years old and a friend convinced me to get my license to do amateur radio operating, and I got my license when I was 13. He and I would build transmitters and receivers and obviously we didn’t design them, but we’d follow instructions and go out and buy the parts and put them together and solder all these wires. I remember very clearly that you’d work for days or weeks on something and you’d usually finish building it sometime around 2 or 3 in the morning and then I’d plug it in, and it would blow every fuse in the house. I wasn’t popular with my parents either but that’s when the science began because you had to go back and troubleshoot and try to figure out what was wrong, what had you done wrong, what was soldered wrong or what resistor was put in backwards or whatever. I think that that experience of troubleshooting and problem solving was really very important in my thinking about being a scientist.
I also always wanted to be a physician and when I got the Nobel Prize actually the New York post, the newspaper went to my father’s apartment in New York to interview him and he produced a baby picture of me, and they ran this thing in the newspaper and the caption said “He wanted to be a doctor ever since he was two years old” and actually I think it’s true. So I knew I wanted to be in medicine and I really liked this problem solving. I went back recently and looked at some papers I had from high school and when I was applying to college I sent out a little resume for people who were going to write letters of recommendation on my behalf and it said “Career interest” and I only listed one thing and it said “Medical research” so I guess I was interested in research. I remember very clearly, in fact I found a book report that I had written on Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis, which you know had a major influence on almost everybody of my generation, who went into medical science. I knew I wanted to be a physician and a scientist and so at university I majored in chemistry although I spent most of my time as editor of the Daily Pennsylvanian, this daily student newspaper.
Then in medical school I had an experience in a summer in elective rotation with a very impressive scientist who managed to be imaginative but critical at the same time, highly critical and it was that combination of being a critic of your own work along with imagination trying to drive yourself forward that really aroused my interest in science. And I did a residency in medicine and there I met Joe Goldstein and he and I immediately … We were in the same residency group and although our job was to take care of patients, what attracted us to each other was our common interest in the scientific basis of the diseases that we were seeing.";589;Motivation
I want to explore that relationship in greater detail later.;But at any rate and then I went to the National Institutes of Health after my residency and was exposed to a very inspirational scientist, a man named Earl Stadtman, whose other student, Stanley Prusiner, also received the Nobel Prize and he produced a lot of very successful scientists and was a very inspirational character.;589;Creativity
You’ve spoken of how he taught you the principles of enzymology. What was it that particularly made him a good teacher, what did he have?;Again, I think it was integrity. As I recall, if you made a novel observation and that lead to a new theory, his attitude wasn’t ok let’s design as many experiments as we can to prove that this new idea is right, his approach was let’s design as many experiments as we can to shoot down the idea and only if we can’t shoot it down do we then begin to accept it. Of course that’s straight out of scientific philosophy but watching it in practice by somebody whose sole devotion was the truth rather than self-promotion or any ulterior motive for doing science, I think that’s the characteristic, his characteristic that washed off on so many of his students.;589;Mentor(Role Models)
Yes, I imagine a very rare characteristic to find.;Yes, especially in medical research where people have a variety of motivations.;589;Creativity
The fact that you read chemistry and then did medicine, I guess that’s a fairly standard path here but do you think that contributed a lot to your approach to medicine, doing basic science prior to clinical science?;I always liked basic science and you know, I enjoyed chemistry, but I must say I wouldn’t have considered a career in pure basic science, I never thought about going to graduate school for a PhD in chemistry. I always had the over-riding motivation to become a physician. In fact, even after I came to Dallas and started my own laboratory and was also doing clinical work. Every time I spoke to my father, my father would say “Well, how many patients have you seen today?” I’d say “Dad, today I worked in the lab”, and he would say “Well, that’s not a very good thing”. It wasn’t until after Joe and I began to receive the prizes, the first one was in San Francisco, he lived in New York and we invited him to San Francisco to see us receive this prize and he came up to me afterwards and said “Well, maybe there is something about this research”.;589;Motivation
But in a way you were very blessed to have such an unswerving determination to follow that path.;I did and there were obstacles in the way. In the summers when I was in medical school, I had to earn money because we didn’t have very much money and so I worked for a pharmaceutical company in their lab, in fact Smith Kline now, you know, eventually became Smith-Kline Beacham and then Glaxo Smith Kline, but they were then called Smith, Kline & French in Philadelphia. I worked in their laboratories every summer and I had a very trivial kind of job injecting things into rats and all my friends who didn’t need the money were working in the summers in much more exciting labs at the medical school and I was quite jealous of that. So, I had a real eager desire to do serious science.;589;Mentor(Role Models)
I daresay the job gave you an insight into something that other people weren’t seeing anyway, which paid off later. So, after NIH and Earl Stadtman you then had these three choices that came together, it seems to me that you 1) decided that you were going to move to Dallas, 2) you decided that you were going to work on hypercholesterolemia …;"Cholesterolemia.
Cholesterolemia. Let’s call it FH for ease of pronunciation and the third thing was that you decided to work with Joe Goldstein, very close collaboration. Those these things inter-related …
Michael Brown: Oh, yes
… and they all paid off to a great degree and they’re all important, so I’d like to investigate each one.
Michael Brown: And they were all not very obvious. Let’s discuss Dallas first. I had grown up in the Northeast. I had gone to the world’s oldest medical school, sorry, the oldest school in the United States, which is University of Pennsylvania. Then I met Joe as residents at the Mass General in Boston and Joe kept telling me what a wonderful place this medical school was in Dallas and I had never heard of it. In fact, I remember when I first saw that they had accepted Joe Goldstein for a residency and it listed his institution as Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, Texas, I thought it was a bible school. You have to recall it, Kennedy was shot here in 1963, I was a second-year medical student at that time. Dallas had this terrible reputation of being sort of a far right wing city and it would have been the last place that I would have ever dreamed that I would have ended up. But Joe kept telling me what a wonderful place it was, not the city but the medical school, how exciting.
We had a chairman of medicine named Donald Seldin who was trained in medicine but had this strong belief in science and had recruited and inspired a whole generation of scientists, Joe among them. I came here for a visit and I was tremendously impressed, again by the intellectual rigour of the science that was going on in a clinical department of medicine. I decided to come here after the NIH, but the problem was my wife and I give her enormous, enormous credit because she too had grown up in the Northeast and certainly had no desire … I mean we lived outside of Washington DC at NIH, we thought that was the deep south and my other offer after the NIH, the other thing that I considered was going to San Francisco at the University of California, San Francisco, that was her favourite city and I will always give her tremendous credit for agreeing to come with me to Dallas. The promise was it was only going to be for a year, that was 36 years ago …
Never trust that sort of promise.
Michael Brown: … and we’re still here. But she fell in love with the city and we raised our children here and she’s never never wanted to go anywhere else but …";589;Environment
I guess it’s an easy place to live?;Yes it is, it’s a wonderful place to do science because it is such an easy place to live. But at any rate, I did come here for a year and then I was so inspired by the place, it happens that Joe Goldstein was not here when I arrived. We were both at NIH together but he did an additional fellowship in Seattle, so when I came I was working alone on a sort of a cholesterol related project, not FH but a biochemical project. Fortunately I achieved some success so by the time he came, I had already at least established a certain reputation locally and so it made it easier for the two of us to work together.;589;Environment
Was the fact that you were here instrumental in the fact that he came back? Had you already made a pact?;"An informal pact. His story is that he was a student here and he was recognised as being literally a genius, while he was a medical student and doctor Seldin, Donald Seldin who is this great inspirational man who built this school, called him in as a student and said – and Joe at that time wanted to be a neurosurgeon – I hope you get him to tell the story, but he was like a second-year medical student and he was fascinated with neurosurgery. Seldin said “No, you’re not a neurosurgeon, you’re a geneticist” and Joe said “You know what’s genetics?” This is back in 1963 and there was no such thing as clinical genetics. Anyway, they arranged this training programme so Joe went to the Mass General where we met, then he went to NIH, and then he went to Seattle. The promise was that he would then come back to Dallas and start a genetics unit, so he had already promised to come back to Dallas and he basically wouldn’t let me rest until I agreed to come also.
But while we were at NIH we had seen these children – this gets now into the second part of your question of FH. We had both clinical duties and research duties when we were at the National Institute of Health and so we’re taking care of patients with rare diseases who had been referred there because their diseases were so rare that doctors of the community didn’t really know how to take care of them. We saw two children who had enormously high blood cholesterol levels, in the US units we talked about it in milligrams per desolator and their blood levels were over 1,000 milligrams per desolator, 10 times above the normal value for a child. Because of these very high cholesterol levels they were getting cholesterol deposits in their arteries and they were having heart attacks, very severe heart attacks and their hearts were failing. This was in 1969 and there was very little you could do for them. Coronary bypass surgery hadn’t been invented and certainly no-one was doing heart transplants. We put them on a zero-cholesterol diet hoping that their blood cholesterol would go down and they just ate rice for six months and didn’t budge.
So, we knew they had a genetic problem and it wasn’t due to anything in the diet and we decided that, we talked about various hypothesis what might account for this and we decided that if we were both ever to be united in Dallas that we would collaborate and try to work this out. So we actually had a plan but it was nowhere near. The idea was always that each of us would have our own separate interests but we would do this one project jointly. I think as I remember it, this was not going to be the central focus for either one of us, in fact I was working on an enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis at the time, trying to understand it’s bio-chemistry and to isolate the enzyme and Joe, when he came here, was working on roosters, you have to ask Joe about his rooster days, but in administering oestrogen hormones to roosters which would raise their blood cholesterol levels enormously and try to figure out how that was working.";589;Creativity
Should annoy them as well, I imagine.;"It was, not only annoying them, but they would run around and the image I have of Joe running down the hall chasing a rooster, I’ll never forget. But anyway, we both had separate laboratories but we decided to do this one project together in trying to figure out what was wrong with these children and the important approach we took – it was different than what people had done before – was not to study the children directly but rather to take cells from the children, grow them in tissue culture. Tissue culture was just coming in as sort of an experimental tool for human genetics. It had been used by few other people to study genetic defects prior to us and we realised that this was the only way, if whatever was wrong with the children was also manifested by the behaviour of their cells in tissue culture, then we’d be able to figure it out. I think that’s where our basic science training came in because as we mentioned I trained with a very basic enzymologist.
Joe trained with Marshall Nirenberg who was a molecular biologist, a Nobel Prize winner and the person who figured out, deciphered the genetic code. So both of us had been exposed to the most rigorous science at the most reductionist levels and we realised that if we’re going to solve a complicated problem like this high cholesterol, we had to reduce it down to something where you could really do experiments. Our whole goal was to be able to do an experiment each day and get the result before we went home that night and if we couldn’t have done that we wouldn’t have done the project. The idea was having these tissue culture cells, we could study what was wrong with them and fortunately the defect was manifest in these tissue culture cells so we were able to work out the defect. What happened then was that work expanded, the joint work, we both abandoned our separate work and just decided to work together to solve this problem.";589;Mentors (Role models)
Things went so terribly fast, didn’t they, because you got together on that project in 1972 and by -73 you had the LDL receptor concept and then in -74 you merged your labs, you just said this is working.;Right. And I, at that time I gave up my clinical specialty so I hadn’t been trained in gastroenterology which is a technically demanding field. When I started it wasn’t. When I started it was a very nice sort of cerebral thing, people came with abdominal pain, or some problem with absorbing things and they had ulcers and it was all sort of a rational feel. That’s what I like about it, but over that time these endoscopes were invented, these flexible scopes where you could look into somebody’s stomach or intestines and that required a lot of technical dexterity. I was very good at it but I realised that if I were going to keep doing that, it would require that I spend many hours every week just to stay competent in it technically and so I didn’t want to do that so I gave up that specialty.;589;Creativity
So that was becoming a technician rather than a problem solver right.;Exactly, and so, even though I enjoyed it, I enjoyed interacting with patients, and it is problem solving to figure out what’s wrong with somebody and figure out how to fix, it but at any rate, that was a very big step for me to sort of give up my independent lab, give up my specialty and I remember agonising about it for a very long time. It was not easy for the two of us to establish this working relationship because both of us were sort of super-achievers. Both of us had been at the top of our classes throughout education including medical school, that’s how we got to the Mass General, you had to be at the top of your class to get to the Mass General, and we both had a lot of ego invested in science. We realised that if we were going to work together we would have to share the credit. It wouldn’t be possible for me to say oh, I thought of this experiment, and if you go back through our entire 36 years that we’ve been collaborating, we’ve never made the public statement or the private statement even between the two of us. To say oh that was your idea, this was my idea. We’ve actually worked it out in a lot of conversations as we were starting to collaborate and what we said was if I say something brilliant on a Wednesday it’s probably because he’d said something that just as brilliant on Tuesday that planted the seed. We we’re just not going to try to distinguish it’s going to be Goldstein and Brown or Brown and Goldstein and not the genius of Michael Brown or Joseph Goldstein. That was not easy to do.;589;Creativity
No, and particular when you’re still trying to establish yourself, there must have been the thought in the back of both your minds that what may happen is that one of us gets ahead on the back of this work.;We actually, and you can ask Joe his recollection, but I remember clearly there were issues like that because Joe actually was more recognised than I was in the beginning, because when he was in Seattle he had done a monumental clinical study of high blood cholesterol and delineated several diseases of which one was FH. He was recognised as an expert in the cholesterol field already and I had no standing in the cholesterol field. I had done this work with Stadtman on bacterial enzymes, so the natural tendency would have been to have given him the credit for what was going on, but we agreed that we would split invitation. If one person got invited to give a lecture somewhere then the next person would do the other one. We alternated senior authorships on the papers, if you go back to the early papers I’m always the last author on one paper and then, or the first author. I think the most important thing that made it possible was that our university recognised this as a joint effort. It’s extremely hard … For example, there are many many universities where this couldn’t happen because when it comes to making decisions about tenure, when you’re promoted to tenure, they want to know that you did x otherwise you’ll never get to be a tenure professor. In our case, that was not possible and so the school promoted us equally at every step. We were both treated almost as a single entity.;589;Creativity
That’s amazing on so many levels. It’s amazing that you two had the maturity to adopt this approach at such a young age, it’s amazing that the university had the confidence in you. Was this driven by Don Seldin?;It was driven by Seldin, yes. It was his vision that made it possible, but the only reason that it worked was that both of us had enormous amounts of respect for each other. It wouldn’t work in the slightest, if for a minute I thought he was just wrong about things and just not up to the task, not shouldering his load and vice versa. I think the idea that we both respect tremendously … Not that we agree all the time or even most of the time, I mean we disagree on all kinds of minor things, how much calcium to put in the buffer or whether to do a pH curve or a salt curve or something like that. The students who work with us know that and you know, the smart ones, when one of us suggest one thing and the other suggest another, the smart ones do both. The fact is that on the major issues we’ve always agreed and on the major steps and the directions that we take because in a long career like ours there are a lot of turns and twists that you have. Sometimes you have to abandon projects because the technology just isn’t there to get you to the next step. Other times you have to just take a leap of faith and try something new, then and we’ve always agreed on those and those kinds of questions. Sometimes one of us has to convince the other one but it works.;589;Environment
Forgive me for dwelling on it, but it’s such a rare thing to find such a productive and long-lived collaboration. How does it work in practice, you share the same office space pretty much, your labs are completely inter-changeable if you like or inter-twined and your students come to one or the other or both?;No, we don’t take separate students. Every student basically has a do-all mentor, the labs are as you mentioned our offices are immediately adjoining with an open door in between so we’re rarely out of earshot of each other. We have joint lab meetings, we’re always present, we have lab meetings with different groups every day during the week and the two of us are always there and there’s a tremendous give and take during these meetings between the two of us, that the students get to participate in and watch. There have been long-term collaborations, the Coris are classic, they were married to each other, but to have one so close as ours is maybe almost unique.;589;Creativity
Are you aware of anybody who has actually modelled themselves on you?;No, we’ve tried, we’ve written articles extolling the benefits of it. I remember times when crucial experiments, back in the early days before we even had students it was just the two of us and a couple of technicians working in the laboratory. We would do really important experiments and the results would come off and usually in those days we were doing things with radioactivity so there would be a liquid simulation counter and the counts, it would printed out on a tape and you’d be looking at this tape as it emerged from the machine and looking at these numbers. When we saw something really dramatic … The kinds of discoveries you really like in the laboratory are ones that open new areas that you know that you know my goodness now that x is true, we can do y, z, a, b and c and d and you just see the next six months of your work right laid out before you and everything you’re going to find during that six months is going to be new. Those are rare moments but they happen and when you share that moment, when the two of you look at each other and the sense of excitement … We never had a press conference in the whole 35 years working on cholesterol which is certainly a topic of great interest, we’ve never had to brag about our work, we’ve never had to go out and give talks, pointing at ourselves as being important and the reason is because the two of us. For me the most important critic is him and vice versa and if both of us realise hey, this is really spectacular, we don’t need to tell anybody else.;589;Mentors (Role models)
I realise that you don’t want to apportion credit individually, but can you identify at least what it is that is complimentary, what each of you brings to this relationship?;It’ll be interesting to see how Joe answers this, but I always think about it this way. In the beginning, when we used to look through a microscope at tissue culture cells or of sections of tissues from animals, we would go to the microscope and Joe would always immediately switch the lenses to the lowest power so he could see this broad field. I would instinctively always go to the highest power, so I could see the most intimate detail and Joe has the kind of a mind that can connect things that no-one else can connect. He’s got this very very eclectic kind of a mind and makes connections between concepts that other people just wouldn’t see connection. I’m probably more analytical in trying to really focus on how does this actually work, what are the nuts and bolts of it. But it doesn’t always work that way, it changes, sometimes I’m the guy who connects two crazy things and he’s the one who says no we’ve really got to understand how this little detail works.;589;Creativity
And broadening it to the students who work in the lab, I imagine that in some ways it’s quite an intense relationship for them to break in on. Obviously the practices of sharing credit and things must be very appealing but at the same time it’s a bit like being the gooseberry when you’re out with a couple. Do you think that’s something that you’ve addressed?;"That’s an interesting point, I haven’t been that sensitive to that. One thing that I have noticed, it’s been very very rare that a student will try to play one of us off against the other. I’ve always been worried that you might have a student who would come to me and say that Dr Goldstein just told me to do this, but I think it’s a stupid idea, that kind of thing. Somehow the students learn that you don’t do something like that, so they really always try to get the approval of both us and I really think that they enjoy having two opinions, kind of like having two parents, I think they like having both of us. Very frequently a student will have a conversation with Joe about something and then come in and say to me, here’s what Joe and I decided what do you think about this and vice versa. It’s funny, one or the other things that distinguishes ourselves is Joe tends to like to stay in his office and call the students in for confidences. I on the other hand, like to walk around the lab.
Could be taken as a sign of broad picture versus /- – -/ again.
Michael Brown: I guess it could be, maybe it’s related but you know, just walking up to a student and saying what’s new, what’s wrong, what’s the problem, anything I can help you with? I think that helps.";589;Creativity
Incidentally that was Paul Janssen’s way of working, he founded Janssen Pharmaceutical, he walked round the lab every day and said what’s new to everybody.;Exactly, I think you learn so much just by asking that one question because you get them sort of unexpectedly and instead of having some prepared presentation the student will tell you oh gosh, I just did this and it didn’t work and then you can sit down and go through it and figure it out. Anybody, any scientist who runs a big lab will tell you that a huge part of it is just trouble shooting, just helping the students figure out why an experiment hasn’t worked or what technique to use, or which way to go. Both of us do that and the students seem to react very well. We’ve never had a student that couldn’t adjust to this system.;589;Creativity
We should move on, but last question on this shared lab topic, there’s a current trend for shared first authorship to try and get away from the problem of distributing experiments among individuals when they were actually done by more than one person. Do you have a view on the way to proceed there, because it sounds as if you should.;Yes, we’ve done it with some of our students. It’s a little sad that the reason that you have to have shared first authorship is because everyone just assumes that the first author is the real driving force. I like the idea that some journals are doing now, which is very extreme where they actually have a footnote and say this author did x, y and z, this one wrote the paper and this one designed figure 3, 7 and 9. That’s really telling it like it is and I think that would be ok. But I just hate the whole ego thing in science. I think it’s one reason why we lose a lot of young students who don’t go into science because they’re sort of afraid, they see is as a competition and that there are winners and losers and it’s really a shame that they can’t see the excitement of actually doing the experiments.;589;Creativity
That’s just a toe in the water, but often the award of a Nobel Prize can at least knock people for six for a while but you seemed not to have suffered from that. Do you think the fact that you were together allowed you in some ways to share the load that comes?;"Definitely, it’s a tremendous benefit of having a partnership because as you know, all the hoopla that goes on around the Nobel Prize and the lot of distractions that happen immediately afterwards, being invited to dinner parties and be trotted out for donors. I always say that Joe Goldstein and I have been so /- – -/ more often than the Brooklyn Bridge. The fact is you have a lot of those distractions and then invitations, speaking invitations, and you know, joining boards and advisory committees and things like that, but Joe and I helped each other to keep our feet on the ground. We literary said to each other, what do we really like to do, what’s the thing that I like the most, coming in to work in the morning. What I like the most coming into work in the morning is to have some excited graduate student or post doctor fellow having been there all night and run up with some result that they’re so excited about where you can sit down with them and really talk about the implications and what it all means and where it’s going. We both decided that we wanted all these other things to interfere as little as possible and we made a certain rule. For example, if somebody calls up and asks you to speak somewhere a year from now, the tendency is always to say yes ok, but we had this rule that you always imagine that it’s tomorrow. Ok. And would you want to get on an aero plane this afternoon and fly to this far off city, no matter how enticing if it had to be tomorrow. As a result of that we’ve been able to avoid a lot of temptations.
In the last few years though, we both have developed more outside interests and we’re less intensely involved in the lab and we’re more dependent on our students and we’ve always run … People who run laboratories run them in very different ways. We’ve always had a very strong … Some people let students develop their own projects, and a lot of people think that’s the right way to teach sciences, where the students come in, give them a good environment but let them develop their own project. Our view has always been we’re committed to understanding certain things, if a student wants to come and join us and help work on that, then that’s wonderful. I’m not saying students don’t make suggestions and aren’t helpful and active participants, but it’s all along the themes that we’ve established in the lab, the things that we’re fundamentally interested in, so again that helps keep us more firmly involved in the laboratory because the goals are goals that we ourselves set. We were young, I was 44 years old and Joe was 45, we always kid each other because he’s a year older, there are five days every year, my birthday’s April 13th and his is April 18th and there are five days every year where we’re the same age and then he jumps ahead.";589;Impact of the Nobel on you
I know there was a positive slant on the way you said it and I’m glad to hear it. When you gave your banquet speech in Stockholm, you mentioned that there were two attributes you saw were essential to good clinical research, one is basic science and basic science training and you’ve touched on that. The other was a technical courage, the ability to go out and try new things and you mentioned that for instance with cell culture in your approach to FH but how do you go about making sure that these two attributes are taught to the medical students here?;"It’s very very difficult. I’m actually helping to direct what we do the MD PhD programme here where students get both an MD and PhD degree and the whole goal of that programme is to expose the students to a basic scientist working on a basic science problem, not to have a student work in a lab that’s working on a clinical problem. What I say to the students is listen, if you want to solve cancer and you go train with the best cancer researcher, in the end the best you can be is a copy of that person, you’re not bringing anything new to cancer research. But if you go out and you train in something else, genomics or biochemistry or some molecular biology and then you start working on cancer now you’re coming to a fresh approach. The MD PhD programmes are designed so that the students work with a basic science and basic scientists learn, view the world differently.
I’ve given talks to the students about this and what I say is that physicians are trained to have an enormous amount of knowledge because when you see a patient who is sick, you don’t have time to look things up in books you don’t even have time to look it up on your Palm Pilot. You’ve got to react and you have to have reflexes and you have to react and you have to be totally sensitive to all the attributes of a disease you have to know all about the disease and what fits and what doesn’t fit and medical students don’t like memorisation but in fact there’s a reason why medical students have to remember a lot because that’s what you do. You really don’t have time to think about where the gaps are in knowledge whereas scientists, a good scientist … The stuff that’s already known is not of much interest, what you want to know is what’s unknown and I would say it’s kind of like looking at a Henry Moore sculpture, the physician looks at the solid bronze and sees the facts of the thing. The scientist looks at the air spaces between the bronze and a good physician scientist is able to do both, to deal with patients and disease through this factual knowledge base and then to somewhat switch your brain in your spare time and think about what the real unknowns are and how really weak the knowledge is. Doctors have to do so many things which are really not based on the knowledge that rigorous scientists would accept but just because you have to do something, and this is the way Doctors do x, you have to learn to do that. Anyway, for Joe and me I think the fact that both of us had training in basic science labs, things that had absolutely nothing to do with human disease, really helped us enormously, and there’s no way that we could have done anything.";589;Environment
I imagine that the MD PhD programme forces people to take the time to take the other approach because otherwise you are just so pressured by the need to get through your exams and get onto the next stage that you just can’t afford to step away from great learning.;"Exactly, exactly, so they take a three or four year period out and do a thesis and really do a full PhD programme.
Is it easy to get people to sign up for that?
Michael Brown: It’s not that easy, we have a medical school class of about 200 students of whom 15 are doing this dual degree. But I think it’s the future of medicine, I think that you, when we talk about technical courage, that’s what we’re talking about, we’re talking about people who are trained enough so that they’re not afraid to reach into this tool bag of tricks that the basic scientists have given us and use those to solve a problem related to disease.";589;Career Development
I’d like to turn to turn to a related, but slightly different topic which is your involvement in the world of drug discovery in pharmaceutical research. You’re on the board of Pfizer and I imagine given the history of your research and the fact that your research has been partly to the development of statins that you have a very strong belief in the need for basic research within the drug discovery field and I wondered how you feel drug discovery does generally in bringing basic research into the environment of industry.;"My view is that the pharmaceutical industry is essential in bringing basic discoveries to the bedside. There’s been a notion circulating around the United States in the last couple of years that universities should do more in developing drugs and then National Institutes of Health have something called a road map which is trying to produce funds for universities to set up drug screening laboratories and produce drugs. I personally think that’s a wasted misguided effort. It’s really really difficult to produce a drug and the hurdles are getting higher and higher because the drugs that we already have are safe and effective for many many conditions so that if you want to have the next drug it’s got to be even more safe and more effective or it has to treat a disease for which no previous drug has ever been developed, all of which are very very high hurdles. I think it requires the intense focus of pharmaceutical companies to do this but pharmaceutical companies are under their own pressures from their shareholders because it’s the lead times in the industry are so long. Between the time a discovery is made and the time it becomes a commercial product is a minimum of 10 years. From the same point of investors who are funding the pharmaceutical effort, that’s an enormous amount of time. So we have this problem.
I personally think that the system, in the US anyway, is actually working very well, because a company that finds a new drug and they have a period of exclusivity to sell that drug under patent protection and again because all the time that it takes to get the drug to market, they usually have only about 8–10 years of exclusivity before it becomes generically available and other companies can make versions of it and give it away for nothing. That means that the big pharma companies have to keep reinventing themselves every 10 years or so they can’t rest on their laurels. The pressure in these big companies to develop new drugs is just enormous. That guarantees that there’s either going to be new productivity or these companies are going to go out of business and they’ll be replaced by other companies that are more productive. The cost to society is the founding, for the first 10 years when that drug is under patent, patients and society has to pay for it as long as they believe that the benefits of the drug are worth the cost. But then after the 8–10 years it becomes generic and basically society gets it for free. I can’t think of a better system to incentivise people to discover and develop and yet force them to have to keep doing it over and over again. The question is can the companies really keep doing this and a company like Pfizer develop Lipator, the statin that lowers cholesterol, their market right now for laboratories are approximately 13 billion dollars a year. Lipator will go off patent in 2011 that’s only four years from now. They will lose 13 billion dollars worth of income. 13 billion dollars is more than the total sales of any other pharmaceutical company or close to it anyway, so the company will probably not be able to replace that drug and the company will have to downsize and will have to find new inspiration and new discoveries.
I think that the system’s actually working now, people say oh, but the number of new drug approvals hasn’t gone up. We have the genome sequence now, we have 30,000 drug targets and why don’t we have all these drugs. I think that’s what happened is that the genes have gone ahead of the physiology and we know all these genes but we really really don’t know what the proteins actually do and we don’t know where the Achilles heal of a given disease is. We’re almost in a time of trial and error, companies select the target, some receptor or some enzyme, they develop an inhibitor, they get it into human testing and then 19 times out of 20 it doesn’t do what they think and they have to abandon it. The success rate at that level is only 5% once you get even to the stage of humans. But each time we hit a try target and it doesn’t work we discard that target, we go onto the next target and actually we’re going to have a lot of great drugs but we’re in the period now where there’s a lot of trial and error, that’s basically what’s going on.";589;Creativity
But the need for, as you say, pharma to reinvent itself on a regular cycle means that they need a discovery engine which creates new possibilities although that very phrase discovery engine is rather worrying because it indicates that it should happen in some kind of processed way and discovery probably I suppose doesn’t happen like that. But is there, therefore, a need to take basic drug research from wherever one can possibly find it and to broaden the base of research that’s feeding into the pharma pipeline.;"I think that’s certainly true and I think the other side of it, at least the big pharma companies have always been dominated by chemists. These companies were all built on chemistry and the ability to make new molecules that can do impressive things. They’ve been actually weak on biology. These big companies generally, generally I mean, obviously there are exceptions, but they don’t have a deep understanding of the diseases that they’re trying to cure. I think one thing that’s necessary is to bring more basic biology into the companies to complement their basic chemistry. The biotech industry has grown up and has the image of being more creative and they certainly try more things, but there are 2,000 bio tech companies and less than 20 actually earn a profit so I’m not sure they have any special way of doing drugs.
There’s another interesting thing about drug development and discovery. We went back at Pfizer and looked at, this was done a couple of years ago, and they looked at all of their drugs that were selling over a billion dollars and at that time I think there were 10 of them, and they went back and said who were the inventors of these drugs and in all 10 cases the inventors were chemists. All of the chemists were young, they were in their early 30s when they did this discovery. The drugs had been discovered about 15 years earlier because of this time lag and get on the market and then work up to a billion dollars so these chemists had an additional 15 years to make a second discovery and not a single one of them had ever made a second discovery. And it’s very very rare in the industry to have somebody who can actually discover two drugs. Once somebody discovers one drug you might as well retire them. And so my interpretation of that is that it’s not brilliance, whereas if these people were so brilliant they made one drug, then why don’t they make a second and third and a fourth. I think there’s definitely a certain randomness here, a certain stochastic chance that any given drug will turn out to be hugely important. The story of the statins, some day when we have time, I’ll go over that story, it’s a fascinating fascinating story, but the actual discovery of the first stand was made in Japan.
Joe and I had been working on these human fibroblast tissue culture cells and studying their cholesterol synthesis and discovered the LDL receptor and realised that the receptor was regulated so that when cells had too much cholesterol in them they actually down regulated the gene for the receptor and they made fewer receptors so if you could ever deplete a cell of cholesterol it would make more receptors. If you could do this in the body, especially in the liver, if you could deplete the liver of cholesterol so that the liver would make more receptors it would take more of this cholesterol particle out of the blood and the LDL and the level would be low. Just at that moment this guy in Japan, named Akira Endo at the Sankyo drug company, discovered the first statin. He was screening moulds, extracts of penicillin type moulds, and he found this compound and it blocked this enzyme HMG-CoA reductase and stopped cholesterol synthesis. We immediately wrote to him and said please send us some of this. because we wanted to see whether it would cause the cell to make more LDL receptors in this tissue culture system and he actually came to the United States to a meeting on drugs affecting lipid metabolism and gave a talk. The meeting was in Philadelphia and we invited him to stop in Dallas on his way back to Tokyo and when he stopped in Dallas on his way home and we met him he was really dejected and we said why, he said no-one came to my – his English isn’t perfect but in translation – you know, no-one came to my talk. Why is that, nobody seems to think it’s important that you can stop cholesterol production. At that time the whole field was interested in these resins that actually bind bile acids in the intestine and remove them from the body. But we were very interested and so we arranged a collaboration and we worked together and showed basically that when you trigger this regulatory response that leads to an increase in LDL receptors.
That was the first paper published outside of Japan on this class of drugs and we knew it was very important. And it just happened that Roy Vagelos was the head of science at Merck. Vagelos is a scientist. He was a member of the National Academy, he was chairman of biochemistry at Washington University at St Louis but then he’d gone to Merck as their head of drug discovery, but he had worked in the field of lipids. He had studied fatty acids and we studied cholesterol, so we knew him and we worked with him and helped him and his colleagues to develop this drug because we really thought it was important. Then, ten years later in 1987, it gets approved by the FDA and by that time the clinical trials had shown that it was very effective in lowering cholesterol, but the question of safety was really, because you can only test these drugs … At that time it would have been tested on maybe 5,000 people before.
I remember just for the first year after it came on the market … Every time the phone rang I was afraid of somebody saying oh we just found this horrible side effect and everybody was just very fortunate that the drugs are remarkably safe. But there was no way to predict that in advance. How do you know that you wouldn’t have had liver failure? A lot of our friends said oh this is terrible because cholesterol production is so important in the body and if you block that pathway you’re going to definitely have some terrible side effect and we certainly didn’t know that it wouldn’t happen, but we were hoping it wouldn’t.";589;Creativity
The story illustrates at least two things, one is that the importance of biology and the importance of understanding the relevance of the target and also the ability to take risks, the ability to have enough programmes going at once that if you do find that it was a mistake to block cholesterol production you can abandon that approach.;You’re very perceptive. That risk thing is exactly right, and I’ve noticed, I’ve known this man Roy Vagelos for years and I have always noticed that whenever he takes a risk he has an alternative strategy. It’s never the final risk that will bury the company. I think risk taking is part of the business and I personally think that people who run these big pharma companies are pretty courageous folks even though the actual reputation of the pharma companies now is very very low. Why they’re considered to be profit mongers and inventing diseases …;589;Environment
They face an enormous public relations challenge these days.;Enormous. But in the end, I think society’s going to have a lot of new medicines that do things that we can only dream, even now certain kinds of leukaemia that we had thought were incurable are now converted at least into a chronic disease. Anybody old enough to remember AIDS in the 1980s knows what a death sentence it was and the fact that the industry has produced drugs that now convert it into a manageable chronic disease. We get very little credit from the public but these are not easy things to do and science has done it.;589;Future research
One last question on the pharma, there’s a large growth in the field that is called experimental medicine, these days, but experimental medicine is basically what you’ve been talking about all the time isn’t it?;Yes, they’re calling it experimental medicine or translation or research. One of my pet peeves is that people talk about translational research and they’re always talking about taking basic discoveries and translating them to the bedside. But I think that real medical research always starts at the bedside. Starts at the bedside and then it goes to the basic scientist and then it goes back to the bedside. I point out that all these basic scientists, a lot of them are trying to cure three diseases of the brain, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease. Why do we know about those diseases? Because there were three doctors named Parkinson, Alzheimer and Huntington who discovered them. There would be no way that a basic scientist would even know what a disease was unless there are perceptive physicians out there, describing them and trying to figure out where the actual real central defect lies. I think this interaction between people that understand medicine and people that understand basic science, that interface is the real place where the action happens. Joe Goldstein and I were lucky to have been able to stay in that interface for 35 years and it’s been a great interface to be in.;589;Environment
Yes indeed. So to close, just the question of what will happen to the Brown Goldstein environment as time marches on. It sounds like it’s not possible to conceive of bringing in two new people to take over those roles.;I don’t think so. First of all, we hope to continue to do this for as long as we are both mentally competent. As you can imagine we’ve both had lots of offers to do other things, but again we’re still getting kicks out of doing it. Now we’re seeing something else because some of the junior people who started out as post doctor fellows with us have now become independent and some of them have actually stayed on our faculty in our department. They’re working on their own, we’re not authors of their papers and yet they have enough confidence to confide in us and tell us their results and ask for guidance. I’m getting a tremendous kick out of just /- – -/ and guiding these young people and so maybe that’s how we’ll fade out and give me grandfatherly advice.;589;Creativity
Welcome to this Nobel interview, Professor Torsten Wiesel. You have devoted your long career in science to studies of the visual processing in the brain and now we can say, and we know, that this is not a simple thing, a simple process, rather a result of a long process that begins in the eyes but definitely does not stop here.;Correct. Of course it’s a very complex thing you’re asking the brain to do, because we can see details, colour, depth, moving objects, etc. Your camera cannot move without getting a slur in the image that is unclear, whereas your eye can move from one part of the room to another and still everything is clear. So this is a very complex machine that can carry out all these various functions, and we are, I think, still at a relatively primitive stage of a complete understanding of the neuro basis of perception. So it’s a long way still to go even if progress has been made.;600;Meaning(Values) of Work
So this is not just a mechanical process? It is a question of interpretation?;Right. The brain has to decompose an image that falls on your retina and there are hundreds of millions of receptors in your eye, photo receptors that are sensitive to light and then there’s only one million fibres going from the eye into the brain. So already in the eye there’s some processing, complex processing of the image and then that’s sent into the brain and then it’s further composed together so that you can see all the things in detail. I used to say to students it’s not like a fax machine, that you send an image up to the brain and there are little people looking up in the brain at that picture, because you actually have to decompose the picture, send it like a message up and then rebuild it so you can perceive it and we know some of the code that is used by the brain to carry this out but we are still at an early stage of understanding that process.;600;Research
In spite of nearly 50 years of studies, I wonder what do you consider as the major step in our understanding of how the visual system works during these years.;"During these last 50 years?
During your career, I would say.
Torsten Wiesel: During my career … You know, I came into a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University at the time. My mentor there was a man by the name of Stephen Kuffler and he had studied cells in the eye that leave the eye going to the brain and learnt about the way that these cells decode the visual image. Also the Swedish scientist by the name of Ragnar Granit was also very important in vision research and he received the Nobel Prize in 1967, I believe, for his work on the eye. My colleague David Hubel and I, we were fortunate when we started, in 1958 we started to work together, and try to understand how images sent in from the eye are handled by the brain and so that was some advances made during our collaboration. We worked together for 20 years in trying to understand how the first and second stage in the brain handle visual information and particularly in the visual cortexes, a primary visual cortex, it’s called.";600;Meaning(Values) of Work
But even after the Nobel Prize you continued your research?;"Yes. But you ask for the last 50 years with advances. So the reason why we got the Nobel Prize was because we made some advances obviously, and that was part of what I said, the decode, the fact that cells in visual cortex respond to contours of given orientations. So that then a phase, for example, is decomposed and then rebuilt perhaps cells responding to different orientation of your facial contours will feed and assemble cells responding in a particular way and the advances since that time scientists have recorded from higher visual areas, because first the signal from the eye goes to the primary cortex, then the second, the tertiary higher structures and we don’t have to go into the details, but at some stage, maybe three steps away, there are cells that actually respond to a face.
Not your face necessarily, but any face that is contoured like a face with eyes and nose and a mouth; those basic characteristics. So that is a major advance in the sense that cells can be so specific that they can respond to a particular object. There are probably other cells responding to a face or a form or shape. Of course these cells you’re not born with necessarily, because there’s a certain plasticity in the brain so that you can not only learn to recognise a new face but also objects which you never knew existed, like in modern art, for example, sometimes you see very abstract things which are invented by humans and you still can see them, recognise them and sort of store them as a visual memory like you store a face.";600;Impact of the Nobel on you
But still I am not born with the cells that are focussed on modern art?;"You’re born with the machinery to learn how to build an image. So these cells are sensitive to contours.
Very flexible machine.
… some part of our brains remain flexible all through life so you can learn new things …
Torsten Wiesel: You’re born with those cells. The newborn child can disseminate colour, it can see things, objects and so on. There’s a certain basic thing we are born with, but then of course you learn a lot of things. You recognise chairs and all kinds of things. So some part of our brains remain flexible all through life so you can learn new things, not only in vision but in language and movement etc.";600;Creativity
The field of brain studies has developed tremendously since you entered it in the ’50s. What do you find is the most interesting challenges in neurophysiology today?;"Neuroscience is advanced to a large extent because new ways have developed to study subjects.
New instruments or new ways of thinking?
Torsten Wiesel: New instrumentation. Both new instrumentation and new conceptual questions perhaps asked. Sometimes you ask questions now that you didn’t ask earlier because there were no way of getting an answer.
What are these questions?
Torsten Wiesel: For example to ask the question that I said before that we want to understand the neuro basis of perception. That question wasn’t asked 50 years ago as a realistic scientific issue, but today it is realistic to try to actually have an experimental programme that tries to address that question so that’s the difference. And I think, you know, there are some people who feel that now it’s the right time also to understand not only neuro base of perception but also the higher issue of consciousness in general because in order to have perception you have to be conscious otherwise you don’t perceive. So those two are obviously linked very much.
So if you want to address a question of consciousness, then perhaps you have to do it in a context of a specific issue, like vision where you have a perception. You can when we know more perhaps about the sensory part of the brain in vision than in the other part of the brain because there has been a lot of interest, a lot of people have studied the various stages of the vision system both in psychophysics and in the laboratories, anatomy, physiology, chemistry etc. So there’s a lot of knowledge here, so I think the next decades in the future you are going to see more and a better understanding of the perception and consciousness related to that.";600;Future research
Yes, there is this question, for example, when I see this flower and I see the red colour here, I recognise the colour here, I call it red. How can I be sure that the red colour that you see is the same that the one that I see? Do you think that neurophysiology can answer such questions?;"Yes, of course it’s been known for a long time that colour vision varies between individuals because it depends very much on the visual pigment you have in your eye.
So maybe your red is my green, for example?
Torsten Wiesel: Most people have, not so much, but we have the cones; we have red, we have blue and we have green cones and they have their own spectre of sensitivity. Most people have very similar spectres and sensitivity of their cones but there are variations. So some in the red cone and maybe a slight difference in the peak sensitivity of the red cone, somebody else may have it in blue. So there may be slight variation, but then there are mutations. There are people who actually have no red cones or blue cones or green cones, so they have specific colour defects and it can be dangerous if you’re in the traffic and you know the red light and you don’t see red light and you have to know that the red is on top and the green is below.
So I think one has to assume that in most cases our perception of colour in this bouquet of flowers is probably similar, even if maybe somebody else would have a clear difference. I have a painter friend actually who had a deficit in his colour, his vision and his paintings reflected that. His colour scheme was kind of strange and some people found it very interesting but, you know, that was based on the fact that he saw the colours different from you and me perhaps.";600;Creativity
Yes, perhaps. But there still is this problem of consciousness of the subjective perception of the world. It’s sometimes called explanatory gap, how can our emotions and our perceptions translate into the hardware of the brain. Do you think that neurophysiology can jump over this gap or fill it in?;Knowledge advances in science at least, usually step by step, and depending on your background and the literature you read you may feel that there is a gap but some of us may feel there is no gap. It’s just a feel of ignorance. You have a knowledge here, up to this point and then you need to know more. You’re ignorant, you don’t understand something else and to have a complete basis for perception let’s say, because that’s what we’re talking about. So you can see that as a gap and it certainly is a gap in our knowledge but it’s not the conceptual gap.;600;Creativity
I have one last question about something else. You have left the research now and you have recently focussed your interest on other issues than doing research I would say. What engaged you most by now?;"You know I was a professor at Rockefeller for a number of years.
Rockefeller University in New York, yes?
Torsten Wiesel: Rockefeller University in New York and I had been in Harvard. David Hubel and I worked together most of our time at Harvard, started out at Hopkins but then as a professor there was a need at a university so I was asked by the Board of Trustees to become president of that institution. It was in December ’91 and so I accepted to do that. So I did it for seven years. During that period it was very difficult for me to do experiments and I was 67 years old at the time. So after seven years I was close to 75 and the question was what … I was still full of interest and energy so instead of going to the laboratory I continued expanding, I should say, my interest in trying to help young scientists to have the same opportunities I had as a young scientist and to try to help to train students from developing countries.";600;Creativity
You mean to move from one country to another to come to good laboratories?;"I’ve been running a programme for Latin American students, supported by the Pew Charitable Trust for ten years, bringing ten students a year from Latin America to come to the United States for training. Another interest I have … I’m now Secretary General for the Human Frontier Science Program which has headquarters in Strasbourg and we gave about 140 fellowships a year to students from all over the world, from 60 different countries.
As stipends for studies?
Professor Torsten Wiesel Stipend for studies. It’s now a three year programme and most of the students come to United States for studies and many of them stay in the United States because opportunities to do science there are usually better, particularly in the developing countries and I’m very interested to try to change that pattern so that we can help to provide opportunities for good training but also provide opportunity for young people coming back to their home country to carry out similar type of research as they did doing the training.So this is a major challenge I think that one should make serious effort.
… it’s difficult for young scientists to be independent, to get funds to do their own research …
It’s also provided opportunities, even in developed countries, it’s difficult for young scientists to be independent, to get funds to do their own research because Europe and also in Japan the professor is still taken very seriously whereas in United States a professor is not taken so seriously and the custom there is that as a young professor, assistant professor, you get your own lab, your own money and you’re doing your own research whereas in Europe and many part of the world it’s still not the case, you are still an assistant to the professor rather than independent scientists. This is an issue that I find very important for Europe and other parts of the world to develop really good science. It turns out the reason I think for the American success has been money but also the way science is organised.";600;Environment
So you want to spread the idea of organising science because you yourself were born in Sweden but you have had your career in the States.;My scientific career in the States, yes, in part because of circumstances I had very good collaborator with David Hubel, we worked very well together. So that was one temptation. In science America became my homeland whereas when I come here I feel very much at home but it’s not as a scientists, it’s more as a person, a private person.;600;Environment
Though some years have passed since you were receiving the big honour. At the time, what did you think would come out of being given the prize? Did it change your scientific work in any way, or your general life?;When I got the prize, 25 years ago now, of course I pretended it shouldn’t change my life, I did try to behave as before. I got, however, quite frequently obvious contacts from persons, from organisations, from groups, to ask me for giving some of my opinions, help in committees and so on and I did realise rather rapidly that that was a good opportunity for me. I had the liberty to choose, to say “no” or to say “yes” and I think I made usually a good choice sometimes. When I discovered that I shouldn’t have said “yes” I tried to get out of the business and …;606;Impact of Nobel prize on you
… there are, people said there are many risks, can you see those risks today, why people …;"OK. When I made the specific discoveries in 1960 of course it wasn’t obvious at that moment what that would lead to. It needed to have the enzymes purified, that took another almost ten years and other people in our own lab contributed essentially to that and it is then in the early 1970s that the enzymes which are able to cut the DNA into fragments, which allows to act, to analyse the genetic information more properly than if you have the very long chromosomal filaments. At that moment it became clear that certain fragments could be recombined differently together and also amplified in so called gene vectors which could be viruses or other small DNA molecules, that actually gave rise to genetic engineering, the recombinant DNA techniques and at that moment the question was raised whether there were contractual risks into doing so. Now I felt, because I had contributed to the knowledge that there are these enzymes and then the enzymes were used, I felt also more of an obligation to think about more deeply on these risks and from today’s point of view I think I did contribute a lot for the evaluation of such more long-term risk which would relate to the biological evolution. I have studied for the last about 30 years intensively the molecular processes of molecular revolution, how do genetic variations which is the basis for evolution occur in nature and are these similar or very different from what the genetic engineer can do in the laboratory.
I work with bacteria and this I found out that there is a big opportunity to understand molecular processes by which the genetic information spontaneously undergoes changes. This can be compared with what in genetic engineering is done reflectively, by human beings and perhaps I could just tell you that there are a relatively big number of natural processes on work too which contribute each in its proper way to the formation of genetic variations at very low frequencies of course because for any living being the genetic information must have quite good stability. However, it’s not absolute. If the stability would be absolute there wouldn’t be any evolution and the evolution is a source of biodiversity. I think it’s a wonderful thing.";606;Roles of Science (Scientists)
But if you then go in and if you can control it, the humans can go on.;If you look at which kind of changes nature does spontaneously there are in fact three strategies, one strategy is within the genetic script, changing one or very few letters, these are local changes. The second strategy is within the genetic information of the organism rearrange longer segments of that DNA and sometimes duplicate one thing and delete it or invert it or put it in another sector within the DNA and the third large strategy is to acquire from another organism by horizontal gene transfer a segment which that receiving organism hadn’t had before. These are the three much natural strategies of genetic variation and their qualities of course with regard to contribution to evolution is different. Now, if one looks at what in genetic engineering has done where also artificially reflected the DNA sequences are changed in order to make mutants on which one want to study what is the effect of such changes on the life, on the phenol type, that can be locally, it can be by deleting a segment, by inserting another segment from another origin and so on and so forth. So, the strategies are just the same and my conclusion for the time being is that we shouldn’t worry too much about the risk of genetic engineering because the risks are very similar to absolutely normal, natural evolution which is actually a natural phenomenon without which we wouldn’t live today and our surrounding world wouldn’t be as it is.;606;Roles of Science
Somebody said to me that the scientists who are dealing with basic science, are different to those who maybe do medical research or develop certain kinds of products and so on with the technique so that the moral high ground is high within the researchers and the scientists so to speak, the basic scientists, but there might be other people who are not as morally, they might have other interests, financial interests.;OK, you’re right, if a technique has proven to be applicable to something of course the inventor of that technique has no guarantee that someone else will misuse it for another purpose, that’s clear, but this is true in any human doing so that’s a general problem and it can be properly contained I think by bringing this particular issue into the political legislation so that some things are actually favoured and other things should be not allowed, that’s the usual case but of course I do realise that this takes quite a number of years going through all this political debate and so on to have it finally implemented.;606;Environment
So it would be good from your point of view to have some kind of similar legislation all over the world on these issues?;Harmonisation of the legislation in these fields would be very appropriate and thanks to not at least through the activities of the scientists themselves I have already recalled the Asilomar conference more than 25 years ago, have helped enormously to make all the countries attentive to these developments and in many countries the laws have been adapted to really conduct the appropriate research properly.;606;CPS
To be able to understand this valuable research that scientists are doing and which often takes many, many years, you then have to be able to explain it as well and I read a beautiful story that your daughter came up with. Could you just briefly relate them to us, as a way of describing what you found out.;Sylvia was ten years old when I got the announcement of the prize in October of 1978 and the next weekend we went to some walks and we talked about what has happened during that week which was really also impressing our two children and then Sylvia said, “If the children in school tomorrow ask me what was that all about, what should I tell them?” And then I tried to explain to Sylvia in relatively simple terms what my contributions were and after some reflection she came up with some comparisons saying “Well, DNA, is that correct, DNA is like the king? And these enzymes which you found, the restriction enzymes, are like some of the servants of that king?” And I said “Well, that’s perfect, good comparison. What is the role of the servants?” And she said “If a foreign king, another DNA molecule tries to penetrate into these cells, the servants kill that invading king by cutting it into fragments” and then I said “It’s perfect, Sylvia” and then I asked Sylvia “Why don’t you write this story up?” and she wrote it and I then included it into my CV for the book which the Nobel Foundation gives out and therefore later on it has spread worldwide, it’s a nice story.;606;Advice for young scientists
Is it important to be able to, in simple terms, describe science today, natural science to make it more popular and more understood?;I think it is important, but it also has some throwback. One has to be careful enough so that it’s not being misinterpreted. Simplifications help to understand better, but they also could lead to some misunderstanding, in this particular case of the king and his servants I think it’s no big problem but if one uses simplifications too often, that can at long term be a source of misunderstandings of some principles of nature.;606;Research
Some people have the feeling that there is now a mistrust between the general public and natural scientists. Have you got that feeling and why is that in that case or is it rather mistrust of what one can do with science so to speak?;It is, there is a certain mistrust, I think it has to do with human conservative opinions, humans, many humans are conservative for whatever and if they don’t see a much benefit for their own life, they are often very hesitant to accept technological progress, I think that’s a normal human behaviour and some of these mistrusts can under certain circumstances be misused by political movements, you know, taking this on their flack. I think good examples have been the use of, peaceful use of atomic energy and genetic engineering is another example which has sometimes been misused in that sense.;606;Creativity
For example, do you mean the debate around, could we say genetically modified food or genetically modified species like for example Dolly …;It goes in this direction, yes, without precisely what is behind, but I might add to this question, going further you know, after understanding how the molecular process of genetic variation works. Me as well as quite a number of other colleagues have realised that these are in fact in most of the cases done in nature by the help of particular enzymes. Enzymes are products of genes and these enzymes often do nothing else than helping genetic variation to occur and also, that’s quite important, to not occur too frequently. So I’d say there are gene products which are generated of genetic variation and some do it themselves and some other gene products are modulators of the frequency of genetic variation, to keep it low enough so that the species guarantees a certain genetic stability.;606;CPS
The positive uses though of your achievements are many, the way research, medical research, have gone further. There have been a number of examples, for example in the cancer research. Would you just give us an example that you are really feeling particularly proud of, where you know that your work has really benefited medicine?;If you go into the field of medicine, I think any, very active protein like, let’s say interferons have been isolated, thanks to these techniques and then the question was, how should one apply them? In which kind of medical problems? Some, there were some deceptions but there were also discoveries that in certain other fields these products were very useful. Another example which has been widely successful is the product of human insulin which made medicine largely independent of insulins harvested from living animals and I think if one looks at these things these are really very good examples. They are also in human populations in the society relatively well accepted while in other fields on which either people themselves or people in their families or in the neighbourhood were not profiting from a treatment, people hesitate much more to accept genetic engineering and their products.;606;Meaning(Values) of Work
Were there times when you really despaired, said No, I think I’m going to give this up, it’s too much work, or too much people might not believe in what I’m doing?;"I had periods in which for long periods of time my expectations were not fulfilled. I can remember that I had searched for recombinants, giving a new type of research in enzymes by either mutation or recombination. I worked on that for more than one year quite intensively, without success, and I was very pleased only two or three years later that some other scientists working with a related system, but not with the one of ours, just found that spontaneously. We had been working on the rock system, the principle can be found, I also know why in my system with which I worked, it would be much, much more difficult to find this kind of thing which I looked for, but that stimulates you, that indeed you’re convinced that sometimes even if your ideas might be wrong, you don’t find the result but that’s how scientific life is. One shouldn’t be disappointed.
So you need to be flexible, you need …
Werner Arber: Yes, I think it is important, yes.";606;Creativity
And you need to share information with other scientists as well.;"Yes. The bad thing is, let’s say if that happens to a very young scientist in his first experimental investigation, that’s relatively bad for her or him. What I told you occurred to me what was it, about 15 years of experience and I was immune against reacting to that, I think, at that moment.
So sometimes it can just be luck as well, hard work and luck?
Werner Arber: Yes, and you have to your eyes open, you know I was finding, identifying the molecular basis of these research in enzymes by working on a completely different project, that was is in 1960, a time when the governments gave extra money to study the peaceful use of atomic energy, power plants, but some of the money had to be given for by safety. We did some experiments in such a project which was trying to find out the effect of different types of radiation on bacteria and in doing that they ran into the phenomenon of restriction and they within just a few months of additional experiments I could show that the phenomenon has to do really properly with DNA, the modification is a mutilation. Once I’d seen that I felt Oh, this is an important discovery. I have, you have to have your eyes open and take your liberty to do a few experiments to clarify what it is and later on I also had of course to tell those people who guided the project that I had done something different than what I was supposed to do but they understood that actually after all it wasn’t so bad and it was alright.";606;Creativity
How do you relate that to young students of today, your story and the way you worked and what qualities do they have to have to go on?;It needs of course interest, some degree of curiosity for how nature works. You have to overcome short periods of mis-success and as I said before you have to have your eyes open to the unexpected, sometimes, you know, each experiments that you do, you do it in order to show something which is in your mind but the experiments may be not giving that answer which you expected but another answer and if you just say the experiment failed and you discard it, you make never a new discovery so, but it’s not an old favour that a new discovery of course is inborn so …;606;Advice  for young scientists
What are the big issues yet to be found out?;Oh, there are many. There are so many. Of course we go more and more into trying to understand complexity, complex systems and there’s a lot of questions which even haven’t been formulated yet I think, there are more. How proteins, which are gene products, mutually influence each other in their activities and so on and also what I found in my own research, the co-existence within the genome of genes which are actually not working for your own personal life, your individual life, but for the biological evolution of the population. These, I call these evolution genes, variation generators and modulators of the frequency of variation which I mentioned already and of course the majority of the genes are other genes which are making your life possible. I mean bacteria, plants, animals and humans and this is a very high philosophical content here, identifying that within the genome there are not only genes whose product work for me but contribute for further evolution, not only for human beings but this is a general phenomenon, bacteria, all the living world and gives the guarantee that nature itself takes care of the biological evolution, rather than that as you still read in many textbooks that evolution only benefits from errors and mistakes occurring to the DNA. Many, practically all of these changes in variations are actively introduced at very low frequencies into the genetic information and of course natural selection, that’s Darwinism, will eventually decide whether such normal mutation is maintained or discarded.;606;Future research
But that is amazing, so those evolutionary genes, the way I could relate to, is that somehow, we are connected, all of us.;That’s correct, yes, particularly since there is this third strategy of horizontal gene transfer, whatever somewhere in nature normal genetic gadget has been developed, has some chance at some later time by chance at low frequency to be horizontally transferred to other organisms so you can benefit from that perhaps in some future time so we are interconnected of course by common origins in the past but we are also interconnected into the future by possibilities that profit from other developments made by others.;606;Creativity
That just makes this absolutely amazing.;Yes, it is, yes, so that is a kind, for me, you know, if you come to that kind of insight, if it touches you. The first time you think, well it must be wrong, then you reflect it, then what is the consequence of it? There are a lot of philosophical, even theological consequences of that, creation and evolution were often in conflict, but what is going on in nature is in fact the permanent slow process of creation and that gives us a guarantee that also in future times, even if some living conditions are going to change, there is an internal natural potential that by diversity will be amplified again. Of course I have to add to that without your question you may ask this not necessary is developing from humans to superhumans but somewhere else in that evolutionary tree there will be the branches growing.;606;Motivation
You mention theology, as you said there has often been a conflict but theology has, a lot of people who are believers of any different disciplines of religion, always have this sort of saying the connection between all human and actually all living beings in some of the …;Yes, that’s right, yes, actually I think my understanding of molecular evolution is something which can give from the side of molecular biology, a confirmation of these opinions of continuous creation, also I have talked to theologians and it’s an interesting aspect, the question is if you are believers on some religion like Christianism, the question comes up sooner or later why does God, who actually likes creation, his work, and likes the organisms of creation including the human beings, why does he allow that sometimes a genetic variation is against the positive life, genetic inheritance, inheritable diseases and this has been my latest quest. But the duality of the genome having genes working for your own on the one hand and working for evolution on the other hand and we do know that not all genetic variations are beneficial. The majority in fact is detrimental so genetic diseases are among those detrimental ones so God, I believe, according to Genesis, found evolution as good and that implies that mechanism, that once in a while there’s a sacrifice of an individual getting by chance a bad mutation so that’s how I think one could think about, I’m not sure whether that interpretation is correct, but it leads me into really considerations of this kind.;606;Creativity
Three days ago, there was a major announcement, a major event in science, you could say, a joint announcement by groups in the United States and the United Kingdom about, I would say, a high-quality DNA sequence of the entire human genome and the significance of this event was underlined by the fact that two heads of state, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, had joined the press conference. We are happy to have here among us two Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine, Professor or Doctor Richard Roberts and Hamilton Smith who have been involved in various capacity in the human genome project. In fact, one of you was actually present at the White House during this press conference. Would you like to take it on from here?;"I’m actually an employee of Celera Genomics, which is a company in Rockville Maryland that has been single-handedly determining the human genome sequence in what many have called a race with the rest of the world, with the public efforts which carried on in the United States, England, Germany and Japan and I think some other countries. The White House ceremony was an attempt to get a cooperation between the public effort and the private effort, not a collaboration but a cooperation where we would agree to not say bad things about each other’s approaches or data or personalities and that we would try to do joint publications in a scientific journal, sometime near the end of the year 2000. Not papers that have joint authorship between the groups but separate publications where we present our accomplishments. I think it’s been a very good thing actually to do this, it takes the focus of the press coverage away from the warring parties and gets it back to what’s really important, namely getting the sequence and getting it out to the public.
The ceremony itself, President Clinton gave a short talk of about 4-5 minutes and then, by a TV hook-up in England, Tony Blair came on and said a few words in his best oratorical style and then President Clinton introduced briefly Francis Collins, who’s head of the public effort in the US and of course there were words said about the DoE part of the effort and there were nice things said all over the place. It was really a pretty good show and then Craig Venter was the last speaker. I was wondering when he went up to the microphones, whether there was anything left to be said but Craig, I think, handled this situation extremely well and got across how Celera fits into this accomplishment. So, we had a press conference afterwards. I think it was not only a truce between the public and private efforts but also an announcement that each of the groups had achieved their goals. The public human genome project announced that they had completed a working draft of the genome which represents about a 90% coverage of the genome but without a complete assembling of the genome and Celera announced that they had a 99% random coverage of the genome with an assembly of those sequences, so that genes are laid down linearly along the chromosomes.";608;Future research
Now that we have two independent groups who have come to an agreement about the general structure of the human genome, maybe you are able to answer the question, how many genes are there in the human genome. It’s a question you get when you lecture in this field and I’ve heard widely varying figures so, now if you get the question, what would your answer be?;"Hamilton Smith: I think at this moment we still are in considerable doubt, but at Celera we’re also sequencing the mouse genome which will be complete sometime before the end of the year, to the extent that we can compare the mouse sequence to the human sequence. The protein coding regions of the mouse and human are sufficiently similar that they can be aligned, whereas the so called junk DNA, the 97% of the genome which doesn’t code for …
Richard Roberts: You’re talking about this stuff I discovered, are you?
Hamilton Smith: Yes, something like that.
Richard Roberts: The junk.
Hamilton Smith: Yes, the junk.
Hamilton Smith: … is more dissimilar, so it should be possible to simply read the two genomes in six frames and with high probability overlap the protein coding regions and get a fairly precise count of how many genes are present and that’s really the strategy that we’re pursuing. We have the mouse sequence, or we will have the mouse sequence and we’re the only ones in the world that will have it, so I think Celera will have the most accurate annotation.";608;Meaning(Values) of Work
Because people are betting on the number and there is a need for an authoritative answer to this question from the gambling point of view and from the human centred views that we entertain. To drive these large projects, the human genome project, obviously there have been precursors, people have got news from physics now that they are enormous projects, big physics and you now have big biology coming around, so once the human genome project has been completed, how will we proceed? I think we would agree that the most important thing now is to find out how the genome functions and we now enter then a type of research where we want to study the ultimate products, the proteins. Since there are many ways in which you can process the information from the DNA and the genome, at the RNA level, there are many more proteins to be found. This field of studying the proteins made in biological systems is called proteomics, so do you see any such big proteomics coming along and what can be done in terms of technology to speed up the analysis of the much larger number of proteins than the number of genes?;"Hamilton Smith: I mean, I can say pretty much what we are planning at Celera. Celera I think is unique in its ability to do very large scale surveys. We don’t like really doing anything unless we can do 100,000 a day of whatever it is, so this is a way Craig Venter thinks and it allows us to do things that can’t be done easily in the university setting or in most other companies. What we’re planning of course is to move into proteomics using new instrumentation from PE Bio systems, mass spectrometers that can analyse tens of thousands of samples per day of protein. The plan would be to, the big interest initially I think is to see the spectrum of proteins that are being made in specific tissues, normal or diseased tissues, cancer, whatever. The plan would be to separate these proteins from say a cancer tissue on two-dimensional gels and then each single protein spot on the gel would be analysed in the mass spectrometer. Essentially hit by a laser blown into fragments of the protein which would then be matched with the genomic sequence and by computer, one should be able to predict the protein peptide spectrum that you would get for each of the genes in the human genome. Let’s say there are 50,000, so that we would get a virtually instantaneous identification of the particular gene product for each of the spots and we could say then that a given tissue is expressing certain genes and we form a database of this kind of information and again we sell that to our subscribers. This is sort of a first step of something that we can easily see ahead that we could produce this. I don’t know where we’re going beyond that but maybe Rich could.
Richard Roberts: The real problem with proteomics is that much of the technology that you need to relate function back to the gene is not in place at the moment, so one issue is well what is being expressed, how much is being expressed if we look at particular tissues, if we look at the brain, if we look at skin, if we look at liver, what kinds of proteins are taking place? At the moment we are able to look at what messenger RNAs are taking place, but we know also from other experiments that the amount of protein very often does not match the level of RNA, so we need both to be able to look at RNA and to look at the protein. One way to look at the protein is to use the kind of technology that Ham just talked about.";608;Research
You made a point in one of the sessions at this meeting that once you study microbial genomes and there is a project called the minimal genome project which tries to define what’s the minimum number of genes. Wouldn’t such a system be the most suitable in finding out the function of various genes, because the human with this much larger genome and many genes is incredibly more complex?;"Richard Roberts: Right. I think there are two separate issues, one issue relates to what is it that really makes life, what do you need, what is the minimum set of instructions that you need to make a living cell? And one way to do that is to take the very smallest cell that we know that is free living, as Clyde Hutchison is doing, and try to remove the genes that look as though they’re not necessary, get down to the minimum set, understand that in completion. Then one will at least know what is the minimum thing you need for life but that’s likely to be less than 500 genes and those 500 genes are a small set of what is present in a human cell. So, I think what will come from say the minimal genome project will be a working definition of kind of what is the minimum of life but there’s so much more to life than that. We need to know what is the precise biochemical function of each of the gene products, what reactions does it catalyse? That is something that for most proteins is not easy to do and we’re working ourselves at the moment on a bunch of proteins that are present in every organism for which the genome has been sequenced so far.
We think that this particular protein transfers methyl groups from S-Adenosyl methionine onto something, but we don’t know what and it’s not easy to find out, it’s not easy to prove that. But it is an interesting protein, it’s present in every genome but we don’t know what it does, no-one has stumbled upon it by genetics or by biochemistry yet, to know what it does and there are many such proteins. In the human genome, there are going to be thousands of these proteins for which we need to define function so what we need is to find high throughput ways, fast ways in which we can get clues to function. One high throughput way is to use computation to try to do that, so you look through the protein sequences, you try to find the little protein sequence motifs that in other proteins we know interact with ATP or they interact with DNA or they’re RNA binding proteins or whatever, so this can give you a clue, but you need to do the biochemistry afterwards to show that the clues that were given were correct or not and we don’t have good methods for doing that at the moment.
Hamilton Smith: Another approach to the minimal genome is the synthetic approach which I think is intriguing, creating “life” in the laboratory. The idea there would be again working with the mycoplasma genitalium is sort of the basic tools or parts for it. Having some idea from the other studies as to what genes are essential, one could actually make a synthetic chromosome that contains the set of proteins that have been identified as essential and then put that synthetic chromosome into a cell from which the natural chromosome has been removed and then see if you get something that will grow in the laboratory. Of course it probably won’t work the first time, maybe not the 100th time either, it could be somewhere to cloning Dolly and in the beginning you had to do hundreds of them before you got a successful attempt. But it would be a spectacular event if one could create a new genome.
Richard Roberts: I guess, when you start to think about the real importance of microbiological research, within the context of the human genome, the methodology that will need to be developed to understand how something as simple as mycoplasma genitalium work is going to methodology that can be applied to the human genome. So if we can learn to do this thing properly and if we can learn to do it in a fast manner for the small bacterial genomes, where in principle everything is a lot easier, we should be able to apply that methodology to these much more complicated systems too and in the meantime of course, we will find out much about what is really important in order to make life. What is it about these proteins and these genes that really makes something living as opposed to just a collection of chemicals in a test tube.";608;Meaning(Values) of Work
If we look at the biomedical benefits of the DNA sequence of the human genome, I’m sure when Jim Watson went to congress, he had many ideas on what the benefits would be and tried to convince the congress and I noticed also that Bill Clinton mentioned cancer, the cure of cancer would be something that would be following after the sequencing. How do you see the immediate consequences in the biomedical field of our knowledge of the human genome sequence?;Hamilton Smith: I don’t think I can foresee all of the benefits or consequences, we’re going to have to work into it gradually, but I it seems clear that it would facilitate much of the work that’s going on. A lot of work over the past few years has gone into hunting for genes in the genome and sub-cloning them and so on and so forth. This should short circuit all of that, I mean you should be able to in many cases find a gene or several duplications of the gene in the genome and proceed from that sort of jumpstart. I think an example would be, there are several groups of proteins that have demonstrated therapeutic benefits, for example the interferons and already we have an example by the genome sequencing of a new interferon which was previously not detected. With the whole genome you can look and often find members of a protein group that you didn’t know about, so these are new potential products. We could discover new epogen type proteins as well or growth factors that can stimulate certain tissues simply by analogy to ones that are already known.;608;Future research
Will it be possible to sequence a genome of individuals in the short time, in such a short time that it would be important in medical practice, in designing the therapy one is planning for a certain disease?;"Hamilton Smith: Not with current technology, it’s too expensive. Eventually I think that we will need some sort of a physical method for single molecule sequencing. Once that arrives, we might be able to tackle the whole individual, but one of the big areas of effort now is large scale genotyping using various arrays of genes. My dream would be to be able to take a single drop of blood from an individual and within a few hours, determine 100,000 single nucleotide polymorphism mutations in that individual, I shouldn’t say mutations but indifferences in that person’s genome. In other words develop an immediate genotypical profile for an individual that could be used in judging what treatments would be best for that individual or what possible genetic diseases that person might encounter in life. I think that’s coming, probably in the near future.
Richard Roberts: I guess the real point that you’re getting at here is that one would like to take individuals and get some idea of their genetic makeup. One way to do that is to get the complete DNA sequence, but in fact you can get a lot of information without looking at the complete DNA sequence because as a result of these things called single nucleotide polymorphisms, we know that approximately every 300 bases or so, along with human genome, there is a region that varies, quite often from one individual to another. By just looking at those regions, in essence just sampling a one three hundredth of the genome instead of looking at the whole thing, one can actually tell a lot about the genetic propensity of various people.
For instance, we know that there are genes that if they go wrong, if they have some particular polymorphism, they have one sequence as opposed to another, that that leads to problems and the first classic example of this was sickle cell haemoglobin where we knew that a single base change in the DNA sequence for haemoglobin rendered the haemoglobin not quite so effective. This was a mutation that had been well kept within the human population in Africa because when you had heterozygous for this condition, when you had one sickle cell gene and one normal gene, you had resistance to malaria which, if you live in Africa, this is quite an important thing to have. That has been maintained in the population, even though the selection no longer applies among blacks who have moved from Africa into the US or into England or into Western Europe and they maintain this mutation because evolution is slow, it takes a long time for it to get out of, and there are many diseases for which this kind of thing is true.";608;Advice  for young scientists
You mentioned the probability of finding an SNP /- – -/ that the human genomes that have been sequenced a body, say a single group and then the sphere group have been different and can you already now see evidence of SNPs if you compare your sequences with each other?;"Richard Roberts: Yes.
They shouldn’t be entirely equivalent, I would imagine.
Richard Roberts: No, basically what’s happened so far is that the main sequence that’s come from Celera is from one individual. There are other individuals who are being sequenced at Celera at a level sufficient to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms. The public human genome project, they have sequenced many individuals, a much larger number than Celera have been dealing with and so there are single nucleotide polymorphisms that are apparent within their data already and there is in fact something called the SNIP consortium which are a group of labs who are specifically looking for single nucleotide polymorphisms. These have been funded by both government agencies and by commercial companies and this data is all being placed in the public domain, so the answer is we know of a lot of snips already but we don’t know enough to do a complete genotype on someone.
Hamilton Smith: Nor do we know which of those snips really are clinically relevant, I mean the large proportion of them are probably pretty neutral changes. We don’t know how many would be medically significant or genetically significant.
Richard Roberts: But this is what will come out of the next stage of the human genome project where one tries to assign function and identify the genes, because many of these we know that these are important for this disease or for that, we will probably find homologs of some of these genes and we don’t know whether they’re important yet, so that will need to be tested. In many ways, we’re really at the beginning of the human genome project, not at the end, so even though we have announced we’ve gotten through this first stage, it very much is a beginning. Biology has undergone this revolution in the last few years where it’s gone from being really an observational science, in which people have been looking at phenomenon and trying to understand them and trying to figure out what was going on, to become a hard science like chemistry or physics where we can really now look at a complete genome and put some bounds on the problem. If we want to explain how a small bacterium works, we can say we’ve found there are 4,000 genes or 5,000 genes, we need to explain this organism in term of these 5,000 genes, if we’re going to do a genetic experiment in which we change one of these genes and we know what to look for, we know we have to look and see what happens to all of the other genes, in order to begin to understand. I think we’re very much at the start of biology, which is a wonderfully exciting time for us, you know I mean this is the time I would love to be a graduate student again, this is the time to be a graduate because there are many discoveries to make, many more Nobel Prizes coming out of this field.
Hamilton Smith: In science, one tends to go from simple to complex and then hopefully back to simple again. We’re in the complex phase right now.
Richard Roberts: We would hope not.";608;Meaning(Values) of Work
So your supervisor buys a licence maybe, to have the detailed sequence for a certain genome, so does that leave the individual graduate student then with trying to define the role of specific proteins or signalling systems?;"Richard Roberts: That’s certainly one possibility. Basically what you have is this enormous textbook, except that instead of being a textbook with diagrams and clear headings telling you what everything is, you’ve got a textbook, it’s full of words but we don’t know what the headings are and we don’t know how to put in the diagrams to explain how this little bit relates to this little bit. This is for the graduate student to start to work out.
Hamilton Smith: Each gene with an unknown function is a PhD degree, if you can figure it out.";608;Advice  for young scientists
"Dr Baltimore, you have been an active scientist for close to 40 years. How did it all started; how did you get into science?";I got into science really because of my mother. My mother was an experimental psychologist and she arranged, when I was in high school, for me to go to the Jackson Lab and Bar Harbor, Maine. I had the opportunity to do research for the summer in mass genetics and it was fabulous, and I never looked back so it was really after my junior year in high school that I was determined to be an experimental scientist, biologist, and through college and graduate school there was never any question that that was what I was going to do.;614;Motivation
Was there any teacher that inspired you?;It was really the people at Jackson Lab who inspired me. My high school teachers, bless their hearts, were terrible, particularly biology teacher was the worst. But the scientists there, Timmy Russell, Willy Silvers, Don Bailey, Charity Weymouth, were just fabulous people. Many of them were founders of contemporary mass genetics and for high school students to work with people like that is a very rare opportunity but they were so wonderful and made it so clear how exciting it was to do science.;614;Mentors (Role models)
What happened after Jackson Laboratory, the summer experience?;I went back to high school and then I graduated and went to Swarthmore College and at Swarthmore there were many wonderful people but none of them were involved in what I would call contemporary research and so none of them were role models for me. I ended up teaching molecular biology when I was in college because I knew more than any in the faculty did, I just learned it from seminars. One summer programme I was at Cold Spring Harbor one summer and worked with George Streisinger. George was one of the central members of the Phage Group, very much of a sciency scientist, not well known outside of the field and a terrific man, superb man, and I worked experimentally with him for the summer and that was a great experience, and he was always somebody I looked up to.;614;Creativity
You got also in contact with Salvador Luria at an early stage.;"At Cold Spring Harbour that summer, which was the summer after my junior year of college, a couple of people came, everybody used to come to Cold Spring Harbor for the summers, Delbrück and Luria and Leventhal and all the central people in the phage school.
These are in the late 1950s.
David Baltimore: This is now the summer of 1959, right, and Luria came and Leventhal. Both of them had recently become faculty members at MIT and they were starting one of the very first departments in molecular biology. In 1959 if you’d become interested in molecular biology, there were really only three places to go, to MIT, which was just starting out, to Rockefeller, which of course had been the centre of medical research in the United States for a long time, or Caltech, where Max Delbrück had the great school of molecular biology that generated the whole phage focus. The idea of going to Caltech oddly enough, never entered my head, the thought of going to California was just further away than I could imagine and although my previously good friend, already good friend, Howard Temin had done that, had left Swarthmore and gone to Caltech, but I couldn’t even think of that. So, I went to MIT, and it was really because I had met Luria that summer. He and Leventhal recognised that I was able to do these things pretty easily and that I had a good experimental sense and that I wanted to do the right things, so they asked me to come to MIT and that was the only place I had for graduate school so I went there.";614;Creativity
So rather than starting to work on phages, you decided to go in a totally different direction, that of the animal virus.;"David Baltimore: That’s right.
What made you make this decision?
David Baltimore: I guess I had the feeling that the heyday of phage research was over, that phage had done for molecular biology what it was going to do and that in my career which after all wasn’t going to start as an independent investigator for another 5–10 years, that I should be looking somewhere else and I didn’t know where to look and so I took what was the most, the easiest sort of analogue or analogy. The analogy was if phage had been so important for working out the molecular biology of bacteria, animal viruses should be able to do the same thing for animal cells. I guess what that means is, although I didn’t think about it a lot, that I had already decided what I wanted to work on was the molecular biology of animal cells. I don’t know why, but I did and I saw animals viruses as a probe of that and so I went to Leventhal who I was doing some experiments with and I said, What do you think of that idea? and he said, You know, I’ve wondered that myself, he said. So that was helpful but didn’t get me anywhere so I went to Luria who was everybody’s greatest teacher and I said the same thing and he said, That’s an interesting question, why don’t you spend the summer investigating it. I’ll arrange for you to work with a young animal virus person, Phil Marcus at Albert Einstein [Medical College] and to take the animal virus course at Cold Spring Harbor.
I did that after my first year at graduate school and it was a revelation because there was just an enormous amount to be done and nobody was doing it. And so I came back particularly from the Cold Spring Harbor experience and said, Yes, this is what I want to do, but the man I want to do it with is Richard Franklin, who was the guy who was teaching the animal virus course that summer and he was at Rockefeller. So Luria arranged to help me transfer to Rockefeller which was a wonderful thing since he really had very few students at MIT in, as registered into microbiology because it just wasn’t something everybody was doing in 1960. And so, I transferred to Rockefeller and did my thesis in two years there and exactly what I suspected was true, was true. That is there was an enormous … to be done and every time you did an experiment you discovered something. I published lots of papers and had a very good time.";614;CPS
The reason that one could start to address these questions for animal viruses was probably the development of the cell culturing techniques that made possible to make experimentations in the lab.;"There were many different strains of development that lead to that moment being so opportune. One was cell culture. Harry Eagle developing a medium that you could use and learning how to manipulate healer cells and other cells. He was central and of course Dulbecco invoked having developed a plaque assay for animal viruses so you could do quite a … of animal virology. Now that was only a couple of years before that the assays had been developed. That’s one of the things I discovered in Cold Spring Harbor was the plaque assays. Rubin and Temin’s work in the development of the quantity of assays for cell transformation, the focus-forming assays from the sarcoma virus that was also a very important strain, but for me, interested in molecular biology, one of the main things was biochemistry. It was the work of Kornberg with DNA polymerase basically and then lots of other people doing lots of other things, Ochoa with polynucleotide phosphorylase and whatever, but the DNA preliminaries was a key. It’s interesting, if you read what people were saying in the mid-50s about DNA when they were just trying to figure out whether DNA encodes proteins and how DNA replication occurs, they didn’t know what the precursors for DNA were. They really didn’t understand DNA synthesis, never mind the sort of geometry of replication, they didn’t understand the basic formation of the bond. Kornberg’s working out that the triphosphate was the precursor and that you could label with phosphate or with iridium the basis and getting corporation was a key.
One of the things that a lot of my thesis work was involved with was in vitro synthesis of poliovirus and Mengovirus RNA, an inhibition of RNA polymerase. Those things all followed on the models of Kornberg’s school basically, although the first … work was actually done by a guy in Chicago named Sam Wise. And then came radiography, radiography’s a very important tool at that point and Richard Franklin was one of the great exponents of that. That’s one of the things I had learned at Cold Spring Harbor and that showed us that viruses grew in the cytoplasm and cells made the RNA in the nucleus. You know, it wasn’t even clear then that all RNA was made in the nucleus, and I actually did some of the best experiments to show that using very rapid pulses in cells and autoradiography to show that all of the grains were in the nucleus. All the synthesis was going on in the nucleus, but if you did the same thing in a virus infected cell all the grains were in the cytoplasm.";614;CPS
So rather than picking a DNA virus that was … DNA was the hot stuff in those days, you focused on the RNA virus, the Mengo- and the poliovirus and then followed the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. What did that mean to you?;Why did I do it that way? Really only because that’s what Richard Franklin worked on. It was not a conscious decision that RNA was more important or more interesting than DNA. In fact, in retrospect it was kind of stupid to do that although it worked out very well and got me in a new direction, but if I was really interested, I should have focused on DNA virus but then Richard didn’t do that, what he worked on was Mengo at the time and some with flu virus, most all, almost all RNA viruses. So that’s what I did, and I always figured I could do something else later if I wanted.;614;CPS
At some point you moved to MIT and then, based on your experience with the picornaviruses the polio and the Mengo you also looked for RNA polymerases in other viruses. How do you come about to do that, to expand to other viruses?;"It was not, it wasn’t a direct line, I had been doing work on the polio and Mengo polymerases at Rockefeller for my thesis and then when I left there and went to the Salk Institute I was actually involved more in protein synthesis and in showing the polyprotein was made and the important role of protein cleavage in the formation of viral proteins. When I came back to MIT in 1968, Alice Huang, then my post doc, later my wife, soon to be my wife, she was working on polio. She was trying to get some experience with the kinds of work that we had learned how to do over those years but she actually … Her first love was the vesicular stomatitis virus so she and I talked one day about what she was going to do in the future, and I said, Well, you know, it would be fun to work on a different virus. I’d been working on picornaviruses now for most of 10 years and that a lipid virus that had a whole different history would be interesting to start on. She of course knew how to deal with it and had wonderful stocks and worked out a lot of the biology interference which was necessary otherwise you’d spend your life studying interference, not the virus. We said, Let’s do that, and a student joined us, Martin Stanford, and we began to look at the virus.
At that point we were doing some hybridisation so we simply asked did the virus look like polio that is, did it have messenger RNA in the virus particle and quickly we were able to show that the RNA in the virus particle was not the messenger RNA, we didn’t find it on polysomes and what was the messenger RNA was the other strand and what the cell filled up with was the other strand, so these were clearly negative strained viruses. In fact we named them that because they had the anti-sense RNA not the sense RNA in the virus particle. But that then presented a puzzle because if a virus has within it anti-sense RNA, senseless RNA really, and that goes into the cell it can’t code for anything so there’s no way for the infection to get started. That puzzle lead me just wonder whether there wasn’t a polymerase in the virus particle that would get the whole infection started by copying the senseless strand and the anti-sense strand into sense RNA. Again I had all this background in biochemistry, looking for something like that was trivial for me, and so we just made some virus and opened them up with detergent and assayed it for RNA polymerase activity and it was … It went off the charts, that’s one of the easiest enzymes to assay that you can find. We were lucky we chose the right virus, I mean we were lucky that virus chose us, I guess. So that was fine and we published that.
And now we are in 1970.
David Baltimore: And now we are, yes, that was published in early 1970 I think, or maybe in the later, mid-1970, was finished in early 1970. And I started thinking about what other viruses you could study and find the same thing that is, you know ‘Hershey heaven’ – can I do the experiment over and over again and find new things. We tried viruses that looked like vesicular stomatitis virus, that is Newcastle disease virus and influenza virus. Newcastle disease virus, that was a polymerase, we published that with Mike Brett. Influenza virus, there was no polymerase activity, or there was just, I can’t remember, maybe there was a hint of activity but it was very low, and it was very hard to work with so we sort of gave up on it. I had been working on flu years before that, looking for … Showing that flu is acting on mice insensitive which is very strange, so flu was always a puzzle and now we know that flu is a puzzle, and we know why and it’s just much more difficult than these other viruses.";614;CPS
So now the stage was set for the real discovery.;"Now the stage was set. In the early 1970 one of the viruses I focused on was RNA tumour viruses, then called RNA tumour viruses. Rous sarcoma virus and murine leukaemia virus, very interesting viruses, very little known about them. They had RNA in them, very hard to grow, very hard to do any molecular biology and almost nothing known about them. I said, Well, let’s assay them, maybe they have a polymerase and of course I was very aware of the background of Howard Temin’s work for 10 years which had lead him to suggest that there was a DNA intermediate in the growth of these RNA viruses and that was an intriguing idea but it’s not that there was no support for it, there was almost anti-support for it. The experiments that had been done to test it were really very poor and came out of it, great poorly, didn’t work well. I was aware of that and said, Well, maybe there’s DNA polymerase in those viruses and that of course would explain everything Howard had been talking about and be very dramatic, wonderful. To do that I got in touch with some friends of mine who worked on these viruses and said, Is there any way I can get some material, because I wasn’t going to try to grow them, they were impossible to think about for me at that point.
Two people were helpful, Peter Vogt, who sent me a preparation of Rous sarcoma virus and George Todaro, who put me in touch with a group at NIH that was storing away enormous amounts of virus and they didn’t know why. They’d had a contract to do it and somebody thought it was a good idea to have it, it was in the freezer, and I called them and I said, Would you send me some, they said, We’d love to send you some. I don’t know that they’d ever had a request before for any of this material, How much would you like? I said, I don’t know, what kind of units do you measure it in? and they said, Millilitres. How many millilitres would you like? I said, What’s in a millilitre? They said, We don’t know. They didn’t have a biological measure, they didn’t have a chemical measure, they just had a protocol and it made millilitres and they froze those away and it was a contract firm, they didn’t know what was in there. But they said, It’s worth a lot of money. I said, Why don’t you send me … I don’t know, I can’t remember what I said … 100 millilitres? They said, Oh fine, we’ll do that, shall we send it by courier? I said, Is it frozen isn’t it, why don’t you just pack it up and send it? They said, It’s worth a lot of money. I never found out how much money it was supposed to be worth, but this contract was a very rich contract. They were spending millions of dollars on this stuff so this was certainly tens of thousands dollars worth of virus. But Vogt’s virus came first and the Rous sarcoma virus. I said, I’m going to do the likely experiment, so I looked for the same kind of RNA polymerase that I’d discovered previously in VSV and elsewhere and there was nothing there.
It was a good clean experiment and that was good virus and I knew the experiment didn’t work. But I had very little left after that because he hadn’t sent me much, so I left that frozen away and the virus came from NIH and there was these little millilitres of milky stuff. I put some in a test tube and now I said, I’ll assay for DNA polymerase and again I knew how to do that, I actually had been a post doc working on DNA polymerase, so I’d purified the polymerase, I knew all about them. And I got a hint of activity. One of these things that’s just enough to keep you doing experiments, but not enough so you know if it’s real or not. I just did something very simple which I took it and I centrifuged it for a while and took the pellet and re-suspended it in ten-fold concentrated and put that in the test tube the next day and it went off scale and I knew I had it. And then it was a matter of doing some control experiments showing it was rather nucleus sensitive, acting on mice and resistant and things like that, that indicated that it was RNA being copied, sorry, it was DNA being copied from RNA, not from DNA, not from anywhere else and we published it.";614;Creativity
At the same time without your knowing I guess, Howard Temin was having exactly the same problem in Wisconsin and you published the papers back to back. How did you get to know about each other?;He had a post doc, Mr Towney, who was working … Howard himself was definitely not a biochemist but Mr Towney was, and Mr Towney was working on this virus, Rous sarcoma virus, and I didn’t know that, I’d never heard of Mr Towney. I had not been in contact with Howard for a number of years, just hadn’t run into him, but I knew he’d be interested, so the moment that I had the data and was in the process of writing it up I called him to tell him, because I just knew he’d be interested. He then told me that he was working on the same thing and he also had data. I said, Well, let’s publish it together. I had already, I think maybe I had submitted the paper that day, so he quickly got his stuff together and submitted it about 10 days later and Nature did not take long to publish it.;614;Creativity
Although for you the discovery of reverse transcriptase did not come as a real big surprise because you had anticipated that and that … to also for Howard Temin. The rest of the world were taken not by surprise, but even it was shocking news, because the centre of dogma at the time was that genetic information could only flow from DNA via RNA to protein, and now you went through against the central dogma. Was that immediately accepted by the scientific community?;"It was accepted and it was accepted largely because two of us had made the discovery, I think if one of us had made the discovery it would have taken a lot longer before people took it seriously and because Saul Spielman upon hearing about this went back to the laboratory and immediately got his people doing the experiment because he had wanted to find something like this but hadn’t really done the right experiment and he was able to reproduce it in no time at all. I don’t think there was anybody within a week or two, I don’t think there was anybody who doubted that the experiments were reproducible and correct. People could have worried about the meaning of the experiment because we had not really demonstrated what people thought we had demonstrated. And we said that. What we had demonstrated was that there was a polymerase in the virion in the virus particle that could copy RNA into DNA. If you set up the Kornberg polymerase correctly it will copy RNA to DNA. It could have been a DNA polymerase that usually copies DNA but that happened to copy RNA was a contaminant of the virus particle. That’s one of many hypotheses, because we had no genetic evidence that this was critical, we didn’t even know it was encoded by the virus at the time, there’s no way to know that. We certainly didn’t know that the DNA that was being made, although hybridised to the RNA so we knew it was a real copy, we didn’t know it had biologic abilities, that it was a real intermediate in the growth of the virus.
On the other hand, I must say everybody accepted our evidence as saying that and it’s a very interesting story in the sort of history of ideas, why a certain kind of experiment captures the community’s fancy and they believe it and believe all it’s implications right away even though, and the investigators may understand, should understand the limitations of it, people won’t think about it. Other kinds of experiments for one reason or another, all everybody thinks about is the limitations and they never think about … They won’t take this as the answer. I can think of two examples like that, one was the Avery experiments that showed that DNA was the genetic material, that was 1944 and yet most of the scientific community didn’t believe that until 1952 when Hershey and Chase did an experiment that was certainly no better and arguably a lot worse than the Avery experiment. Why was one experiment accepted and not the other, is the time, is the idea right, or was it the nature of the experiment? I think it’s the nature of the experiment and I could talk about what it is, but I don’t really know what the nature is that’s so important.
Another example was, and that may have been pure stubbornness, when the Watson–Crick model was published. The Watson-Crick model implied that these intertwined strands of DNA colour pairing are duplicated and the best minds of the scientific community, Allbrook, Leventhal, others at the time, focused on the difficulty of imagining that you could unwind the strands, that was the big question. There are many many papers published about the difficulty of unwinding the strands and actually Leventhal published the only sensible article about it in which he said it’s not a big difficulty, because he actually calculated the forces involved. But that was the generation of the Meselson-Stahl experiments. The Meselson-Stahl experiment … There’s a whole book about this that I’ve just been reading. Meselson was very careful to say that his work only showed that the nitrogen in DNA was semiconservatively distributed during DNA synthesis, but the scientific community immediately said that the unwinding problem is not a big problem, clearly that’s how DNA works, done. It was the years later before it was really proven that that’s how it worked. Why was the Meselson-Stahl experiment so influential and yet really limited in what it said. I don’t know. Anyway, our experiment was very influential and the world was very comfortable right away, but it was really hill and hell over. A pair of Czech scientists who a number of years later showed that the DNA intermediate that you can get from cells were infectious DNA that proved that there was a DNA intermediate. We didn’t prove it.";614;Meaning(Values) of Work
… and you were awarded the prize say just five years afterwards, in 1975, together with Howard Temin for the discovery of a reverse transcriptase. That’s an unusually short period for the assembly to be convinced of the impact of the discovery. Could you comment on the downstream effects of your discovery, the role of reverse transcriptase in biomedical research after that.;"I think the Nobel assembly was responding to one thing which was that our discovery of reverse transcriptase, whatever it said about the biology of the virus, provided the technology for working with retro viruses and turned an intractable viral system into an easy manipulable viral system because you had available of biochemistry to use. You could find out what the genes were, you could find out how the replication worked, you could uncover all of its secrets and ultimately because you could then find oncogenes using the copies of the RNA as probes. I think by 1975 that was eminently clear and probably, well certainly rarely in history have there been so many papers published that followed from an initial observation as there were published in the cancer research literature following our discovery. Cancer is the thing that frightens people most in the whole medical world and was at that point a virtually intractable disease, it’s still a very difficult disease, so a major step forward in cancer research was something that, in a sense it’s not surprising that the Nobel Assembly responded and responded to quickly and it was real. I don’t take credit for the fact that our observations lead to that, it was just that that turned out to be the bottle neck and then suddenly everything opened up. I think that’s what they were responding to.
Two other things happened soon thereafter but they weren’t clear in 1975. One was that we had also opened up biotechnology and we didn’t know that, but a year or two after we discovered the polymerase, we learned how to make enough of it, we learned how to assay it with exogenous templates, not just what was in the virus, turned out it purified easily. Then /- – -/ working in my laboratory as well as somebody working with Phil Leder showed that you could copy globin messenger RNA with it and that was in terms of bio technology one of the most important discoveries that was made, because it opened up the whole ability to capture the information in messenger RNAs as DNA and allowed you to use what then became cloning technology but of course that was only after 1974, 1975. You could use cloning technology to insert genes and detectors and to manipulate them and so that was a really central technology. But it wasn’t so obvious by -75 that that was true.
The third thing was obviously only done in 1982-83 and that was the discovery of HIV, because HIV is a retro virus like the ones we’d been working on and was in fact discovered by its reverse transcriptase activity, that was a tremendous downstream advantage. Had HIV been discovered in 1970 rather than 1980, nobody would have known how to look for it, because we wouldn’t have had that information. If it were discovered in 1960, ten years before reverse transcriptase. The world would have been a terrible place for that because it was already getting to be a terrible place by 1982 because of fear. It’s the kind of thing we now see with mad cow disease, when you don’t know the biology of a situation people get terrified about where the disease might come from and how it might affect them and they stop eating meat even though the meat of the animals probably doesn’t have any chance to hurt them. This stopped sex and dealt with a transmission of a basically sexual disease. It was a terrible time for two or three years there when we didn’t know it was a virus and every hypothesis you could imagine was being suggested. It was an immune response to semen, was a classic thought. It never occurred to me but some other people, so yes, the discovery had lots of downstream impact and that was enormously gratifying. It continues to be, we just sequenced the genome, the human genome, and it turns out to be on the order of 50% of the human genome comes about by reverse transcription so it’s not exactly a small mechanism in biology.";614;Meaning(Values) of Work
And you were 37 when you got the prize. The general idea is that once you get the Nobel Prize your scientific career is almost over and it’s deleterious for your future research. How did the prize affect you?;It affected me in lots of ways, I became a sort of semi-public figure, but I tried hard not to live up to the prize, that is to somehow change the way I lived because I was a Nobel Prize winner, and most of the time I could manage to live without thinking about it. I just continued to do science the way I wanted to do science and have done so since. The year I won the prize, 1075, I was on sabbatical in New York with a clear desire to change the orientation of the science I was doing. The reason for that goes right back to where we began this, that cloning technology had come along and it was now clear that we were going to be able to do with animal cells what we had previously only been able to do with viruses or with bacterial cells, because we could take out the genes one by one and clone them and characterise them and put them in bacteria and deal with them that way. I said to myself this is the time to move to a mammalian cell system that would enable me to look at genes in mammalian cells rather than genes of viruses. The system that I really wanted to work on was the immune system and I should have gone to a laboratory where I could do that, but most of the laboratories where I could do that were either far away or I didn’t want to be there. I instead went to Jim Darnell’s laboratory in New York at Rockefeller, partly because it was comfortable for me, partly because my parents were in New York and partly because the important thing was to get away. The Nobel Prize followed me and so I didn’t have the nice quiet year that I expected to have, but I did manage one way or another to learn enough and think enough and talk to enough people to decide that I could move into immunology and use the background that I had effectively in immunology. I’d always had immunology in my sights ever since I was at the Salk Institute because at the Salk Institute I’d become very friendly with a number of immunologists particularly Martin Weigert and Mel Cohn and they were extremely clear thinkers and they had oriented my thinking about immunology in a very, what turned out to be very productive and what seemed to be then a very precise way and it was a focus on, again the molecular mechanisms on, gene rearrangements on somatic mutation and … so that’s in fact what I did.;614;Impact of Nobel prize on you
This time in the mid 1970s was also a very critical time for the development of recombinant DNA technology, I think -75 was a critical year. You together with some prominent scientists raised the warning finger and you convened a meeting in Asilomar to discuss what the implications of the new recombinant DNA technology could be and the risks involved. That also led to a moratorium of gene cloning or recombinant DNA work in Cambridge, Harvard and MIT. Could you tell a little about why you took that step and whether that was a thing you would re-do if you would re-live it.;"There was a presentation at a Gordon conference in the summer of 197-, I think it’s -74 it may be -73, that Maxine Singer had been involved, I think she’d organised the meeting and she wrote a letter to the National Academy of Sciences along with the other co-organiser of the meeting Dieter Söll saying that at this meeting it had been announced that it was possible to put together pieces of DNA from different sources and re-insert them into bacteria and get them to be maintained and that was the start of recombinant DNA technology. Anybody could look downstream and see that this was going to be a dominant technology of molecular biology from then on. But there were a lot of concerns and there were some very particular ones that made sense to me. One was that you could spread animal viruses if you tried to put the whole copy of an animal virus into a bacterium, because the bacteria could be a source of the virus and that this was a sort of unnatural system of spread. Same thing was that you could spread antibiotic resistance because you could put genes for antibiotic resistance into bacteria in the lab in this cloning way and then they would spread to other places. And there were some other concerns that we had that were, I think, pretty precisely focused. Then there was some very vague general concern about whether we really knew what we were doing if we were going to put genes from any source into any other animal or plant or bacteria.
We didn’t know how to respond to this concern so the first thing we did was that a small group of senior people got together to talk about it. Actually, the letter was sent to the National Academy, the National Academy called Paul Berg and said, Paul, help, what do we do about this? Paul called me and I said, Let’s have a meeting. We all got together at MIT actually, in the cancer centre, on the fifth-floor conference room in the cancer centre and talked for a day about this. In the end we decided that first of all this is a problem that, this is a situation that if it became a real problem was going to get out of hand very rapidly. Unless we stopped what people were doing and had a breather and thought about it for a while, we were just going to march ahead without thinking, so we said this is a situation which we needed to monitor. We called this form moratorium in the sign of the community, we didn’t have any status to do this, but we did it and we wrote a letter that was published in PNAS and in Science magazine signed by Paul Berg and me and Jim Watson and Norton Zinder and a whole group of people. We brought that letter to the National Academy as a response to their concern, and it was adopted by the National Academy as an appropriate action. As far as I know it was absolutely observed by everybody in the community and it said, Let’s not do certain kinds of experiments – and it was the kinds that I talked about, antibiotic resistance, genes and virus genomes and that sort of thing – and let’s get up some kind of regulatory framework around this.
The big question that none of us knew enough about, it was partly because of the people who were there, was what’s the natural history of virus, of bacteria that we grow in the laboratory. Some of us felt that probably anything you grow in the laboratory is so feeble as an organism and is so full of genes that you put in there and mutations you put in there that it couldn’t possibly grow in nature. But other people said, How do you know that’s true? and we didn’t and How do you know that it couldn’t share it’s genetic material with some other organism in nature and so maybe it can’t grow but it can transform another or make with another organism? and we didn’t know. We felt there were a lot of questions there and there were some people who knew about this, who had worked more on unnatural situations. We said, Let’s all get together and have a meeting and talk about the science that underlies the kinds of issues that concerned us, and ask ourselves are these issues? We put together an international meeting which was held the next year at Asilomar, known as Asilomar 2, because we had all been together concerned about another set of biological safety issues and we had Asilomar 1 a couple of years before that. The recommendations that came out of Asilomar 2 was that we should keep the moratorium in place effectively – we didn’t like the word moratorium but that’s what it was – but find a way of dealing with the question serially and reducing the kinds of containment that were necessary to do these experiments or establishment containment and then reduce over time, which meant two things. We needed a national panel to oversee this on a continuing basis and that was established as the recombinant DNA advisory committee of the NIH and that we had at all costs avoid legislation because as soon as there was legislation, and there was a lot of public interest at that time, it was going to be frozen in stone and almost impossible to reverse because once you put in some regulatory framework and legislation, getting it out of there is politically very difficult.";614;CPS
Let me go back two steps here. The molecular analyses of animal viruses lead to the discovery of the reverse transcriptase that lead to the unravelling of the mechanism how retroviruses or congenic viruses replicate. That in turn took you to gene therapy, HIV, to the oncogenes and so forth and so on. You have covered very broad areas during your 40 year’s career. Could you tell me … In retrospect everything looks very logical, you go from A to B to C, could you tell how your science evolved, was it a logic rational approach to new problems or does it only look like that from retrospect?;There was certainly never any logic in prospect. That is, I never said to myself in 1960 that if I start working on animals viruses I can go to cancer and that I can go to the immune system and development. It was little steps. I started working on picornaviruses and then I saw a little opportunity and I moved into other kinds of viruses and found the reverse transcriptase and that lead me to think about cancer and so I started some systems based in cancer viruses. Then one of those turned out to transform B lymphocytes so that was an attractive notion to go into immunology. And then, as I described to you, I also had other reasons to think immunology was interesting, so it was as if lightening had struck twice and was telling me something. I worked on Abelson virus and Abelson virus turned out to transform the B lymphocytes and I was interested in /- – -/ transfer which turned out to be a key determinant of gene arrangement, somatic mutation in lymphocytes. It sounded like I ought to work more seriously in that area so I moved into that area, did more work in that area. So, there was always a reason and always a connection between the past and the future but I was never consciously directing myself so that I would end up somewhere. I was just following my nose and then not being afraid to take a step to the side or a step in a new direction when that opportunity seemed to be ripe.;614;CPS
And this was showed that basic science is unpredictable, you never know where you actually go.;Careers are unpredictable, at least productive careers are unpredictable. It’s not so much that basic science is unpredictable, although it is, it certainly is, and you never do know where the exciting things are going to come from. But then you have to be sensitive to them and willing to respond to them and I think a lot of people aren’t, spend their life mining just that area that they started out in without branching out into other areas and it’s a shame.;614;Motivation
We live in a very exciting time in science today with genome projects, we have gone from viruses to bacteria to simple organism, now we have the human genome to attend to. Could you predict what this will mean for the scientific development and the implications of the human genome?;"There are two implications of the human genome that I find very powerful. One of them is that we have come to closure on the question of what genes there are in humans, or in mice or in other animals for that matter, plants even. Closure means that now when I do an experiment, I never have to say maybe there’s something out there I don’t know about which is causing that effect. Maybe I don’t know what’s causing the effect, but I know where to find it, it’s in that catalogue. I may not know how to read the catalogue, I mean don’t know where to look, but I know what my problem is, my problem is where in that catalogue is it all coming from, not is there something out there I’ve never seen before, nobody’s ever seen before. That’s a different way to do science. It’s a closed system rather than an open system. The other big thing and that’s really affecting how I’m doing work today is that we can scan the whole genome for its response to a given situation, just take as an example, I infect a cell with a virus. Up until now, I looked at the cell and said what was different about it by looking at specific proteins or specific cytology or specific something or other, because that’s what I was interested in, but I was never able to say what are all the changes in this cell that are going on.
Today, at least at the level of gene expression, I can say what are all the things that are going on and measure them all and that’s what these gene chips do for you, the ability to scan the genome. Again, it’s a different kind of science. At a certain stage it’s not even hypothesis driven, it’s just let’s have a look, but then all sorts of hypotheses come out of that so it’s just observational science for a moment like back in the days when Harvey first opened the body and looked inside that lead to lots of hypotheses. And that’s incredibly exciting and just nails you to do things, so having closure and having the ability to scan the whole system all at once are two things that are just going to make science different.";614;Creativity
Why don’t we start and say that this interview is in the Insel Halle during the Lindau meeting and I’m Sten Orrenius. And I have the pleasure of carrying out this discussion with Professor Christian de Duve who received the Nobel Prize in 1974 for discoveries concerning the structural and functional organisation of the cell together with Albert Claude and George Palade. And my first question is perhaps a banal one, but I would like you to comment briefly on how it all started.;"I won’t give you the whole history of my life, but basically when I entered university I wanted to become a physician. That was my goal. But then when I was in medical school I had some free time and spent it in a physiology laboratory doing some research under a professor there and I was so enthusiastic about research that I found it difficult to finish my medical studies, because I didn’t want to waste time getting a clinical training, but anyway, I finished. By that time the war had started in Belgium and I was interested at that time in insulin, the mechanism and action of insulin. I decided that I could not solve this problem with the kind of techniques that I was using in this rather traditional physiology laboratory. I decided I needed biochemistry. Since I had time on my hands, I went back to school and studied chemistry and got a degree in chemistry, doing many other things at the same time, including being an assistant in a cancer hospital, at least to get the food and lodging.
Anyway, the war was ended and then I decided now I know medicine and biology, I know chemistry, it’s time to become a biochemist. There were really not very good biochemists in my university, and also I want to take advantage of newly gained freedom, get out of the country and find the training I needed elsewhere. I had been, before the war already, I had been to Sweden and to Norway, I knew the countries and I loved them very much, and since Sweden had not known occupation, I thought well let me try and find something in Sweden. I had known a Swedish girl, she was really Hungarian, who was a chemist, and she worked with Hans von Euler and I decided I would go and work with von Euler. I wrote to her, I hadn’t seen her for five years of course, and I wrote to her and she said Hans von Euler is passé, you should go to Hugo Theorell, he is the coming man in Stockholm. I wrote to Theorell, I wrote a letter in which I explained all this. I said I don’t know anything about biochemistry. I want to become a biochemist. I would work on any problem you give me.
Amazingly, he accepted me. I still don’t understand why he accepted me because, I had a thesis, but on insulin. So anyway, that’s how I spent 18 months at the Medicinska Nobelinstitutet, Hantverkargatan 3 in Stockholm. Those were fantastic months, I really enjoyed them. But when I came there, I will tell you, I said to Theorell: I know nothing about biochemistry, you’ll just have to give me a problem, any problem, which was crystallising human myoglobin, that’s the problem he gave me, so that I can learn the techniques. He sent me to a fantastic man, who’s dead now, you may have known him, Åkesson, who was his first technician, but who eventually became a PhD and a professor at the end of his years. Åke Åkesson was a fantastic teacher, he really taught me to pipette, to measure pH, to precipitate proteins with amino, and so on and so on. I learned the trade from Åke Åkesson. I learned many other things from Theo, as we all called him, Hugo Theorell, who was a wonderful man. Also I met a number of very interesting people because that laboratory had become world famous, and so by the time I was there, after I arrived, I was about the first one to come, there were a number of Americans, Breton Charles arrived, and John Buchanan, there was Ralph Holman, there Chris Athenson arrived the day I left, so it had become a major laboratory. And I will always remember those times which were really wonderful and of course I got to learn the Sweden and there are many other stories, including Nobel stories, that I could tell, but there isn’t time and it’s not important here.
Then after Theorell, I went for six months to work with Carl and Gerty Cori in Washington University in St Louis because I wanted to get back to my main problem which was insulin, and of course they worked on that. There I was able to work for five months with Earl Sutherland, in fact, together we established that glucagon is made by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islet. Finally at the beginning of 1948 I came back to Belgium to start my own laboratory. You can see I’ve been very, very lucky because Hugo Theorell got the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1955, Carl and Gerty Cori got it in 1947, just while I was there, and Earl Sutherland got it in 1971, so chance has it that all my mentors were … Even my Belgian mentors were not Nobel Laureates but had worked with Nobel Laureates. They always ask whether the Nobel Prizes are hereditary and not genetically I think, although there are a couple of father and son pairs. But I think science, and this is really a rather important message, I think science, especially the art, the craft of scientific research, is not learned in books. The only way you can learn to do good science is to work under a good or several good scientists.";618;Meaning(Values) of Work
I wondered because we have just heard a panel discussion on creative milieus in science and certain things were brought up there, among those differences between Europe and America. I would like to come back to this and ask you the question: if you compare the creativity and the milieus in the Theorell laboratory when you came as a post-doc, with the Cori laboratory and your time in America, at that time were there obvious differences? Was one more European and the other more American? Or were they pretty similar would you say?;The Cori’s came from Europe, and their laboratory was much more the hierarch kind of, European, they were very autocratic. We all did what we wanted but it was all very, you know, their door was not open all the time. Whereas Hugo Theorell, Theo, he was available all the time. He would be in the lab, he would talk with people, he would sing, he would walk on his hands, because he had polio and had a problem walking on his legs, so he would be walking on his hands, singing. I would have lunch with him every day. That was a privilege, I don’t know why. Anyway we would try to talk French, he liked to use me to speak French. We never spoke of science. Mostly we spoke of music because Theo, as you know, was a very good violinist and Margit, his wife, she was a concert pianist and a harpsichord player. We spoke of music, we spoke of many things but rarely of science.;618;Environment
Would you say that from that aspect that the Theorell laboratory at the time was a pretty unusual or uncommon European laboratory?;I’ve never known in my life a laboratory that had a very strong boss and a hierarchical organisation. Wherever I went there was a tremendous conviviality and collaboration and lack of formalism between professor and students. I think perhaps the better scientists are probably less … insist less of being on top of the mountain and looking down on those students and so on, because I think you have to feel insecure to want to put this distance between you and the other people. But good scientists are not insecure.;618;Environment
There are several other interesting aspects I would like to bring up in this interview, and that is when you returned to Belgium from the United States, you returned to go back to your work, maybe you had gone back to your insulin work already at the time, and you had pursued that very actively for a long period of time. You went back to Belgium and then during the late 1950s you changed your direction of research.;"No, it started much earlier. To try to make it very short, all these 12 years that I had devoted to my personal training had as a final goal to elucidate the mechanism of action of insulin on liver, that’s what I wanted to do. As soon as I had my own lab and a small group of collaborators, I decided that I would study some of the biochemical aspects, enzymatic aspects of liver to try and find out what made it so difficult to demonstrate this action of insulin in vitro on liver. Then I chose an enzyme that had in fact been discovered by the Cori’s, but not characterised by them, because I thought it might be a very critical enzyme in this whole mechanism because it exists in liver and not in muscle and that may be a big difference. That was glucose 6-phosphatase.
Our first work was to characterise, trying to purify glucose 6-phosphatase. Now it turned out that, I’ll try not to go into details, but when we tried to purify this enzyme by standard techniques we came to the conclusion that it must be bound to some structure. The main conclusion was that at pH5 the enzyme would be precipitated and then it would remain precipitated, even at the external, so it was not isoelectric precipitation, it was some kind of agglutination. Claude had just described his techniques for fractionation and so I said – it was a difficult decision – let’s find out what structure by using Claude’s technique. We did that first, we developed our first system for centrifugal fractionation following published techniques and quickly demonstrated that glucose 6-phosphatase is basically a microsomal enzyme. It’s bound to microsomes, now we know it’s bound to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. That was that. We knew about that and at the same time we had proved something, namely that microsomes correspond to a special cell, but which was not yet clear at that time. It so happened that at the same time we had been studying another phosphatase, acid phosphatase. Not because we were interested in it, but because when we purified the glucose 6-phosphatase we had to separate it from the acid phosphatase. We also measured the acid phosphatase on the fractions. And run into this – now it’s a well-known observation, at that time it was very surprising – namely that in our fractions the enzyme had disappeared. We could not find it or very small amounts. I thought at first that we’d made a mistake and five days later, we kept the fractions in the refrigerator, and we re-assayed them and there the enzyme was. One thing leading to another, I thought that was a mystery, the missing enzyme and so on, why is it missing, why is it not?
One thing leading to another, I left insulin on the back burner to find out why acid phosphatase did not show its normal activity. When you know the answer it was because it was inside a little bag and as long as the membrane of that bag was intact, the enzyme would not be able to act on an external substrate. You open the membrane, it comes out. it acts on the substrate, that was a fascinating observation. I left insulin on the back burner for a little longer and went after that, because there were a couple of other enzymes that were possible candidates for this kind of behaviour, beta-glucuronidase and cathepsin D, indeed they did behave in the same way. Then two others were found to behave in the same way, acid ribonuclease and acid dioxygenase, and by 1955 we had published already six tissue fractionation papers. And the number six has in it the word lysosol, that’s when the word lysosome was invented, so you see by 1955 I was already very much immersed in this kind of work. Although in the lab many people were still working, and are still working today, on carbohydrate metabolism. And so peroxysomes followed lysosomes in fractionation and so we discovered the peroxysomes. And that is basically how I became a cell biologist. I never used an electron microscope in my life. In fact, we did not even have a microscope when we did all this work. All this work was strictly biochemical. I discovered, if you like, tried isolated those two new cell paths, lysosomes and peroxysomes using strictly the approachable biochemist when he purifies a protein using fractionation techniques of one sort of another, chemical measurements to follow my enzyme.";618;Career Development
The latency of the acid phosphatase led to the work on lysosomes and the discovery and characterisation of the lysosome. Was there a similar observation that led to the peroxysomes?;No, it turned out that when you fractionate using the classical technique then the lysosomal enzymes sediment about two thirds with the mitochondrial fraction, one third with the microsomal fraction. We devised a technique with an additional very small intermediate fraction between the mitochondria and the microsomes in which those enzymes were highly concentrated so that they are associated with particles that are a little smaller than mitochondria but bigger than microsomes and so they sediment in between. From working the literature in particular, some work that was done by Alex Novikoff, who became as you know the electron microscopist most interested in lysosomes and peroxysomes. I included in our measurements an enzyme that might be a candidate for the lysosomes and that was urate oxidase, uricase. It behaved the same way but it was not latent. It had an alkaline pH optimum where all the others have an acid pH optimum. We said, well that looks like maybe something different, and so we followed, we found other enzymes, diamino acid oxidase, catalase, lactic acid oxidase, behaving in the same way and not being latent, except catalase for some special reason. We developed new techniques based on density gradient centrifugation, in which we were able to separate those two groups, lysosomes on one hand and the non-hydrolytic enzymes which were mostly oxydasers plus catalase. And that was the peroxysomes, which we now know of course to be very complex organelles in some plants and in some lower animals and so on.;618;Meaning(Values) of Work
When you had gone back to Belgium and developed your career and became professor at the University of Louvain you continued to build the group and to do your research. Then, a bit later you also were recruited as a professor to the Rockefeller University as it was at the time, and from my early time in research, I remember you having passes to major research institutions or research groups, both contributing enormously to the cell biology field. How did that come about and how important were these two appointments, the two milieus?;"That is one of the many lucky accidents in my life. Belgium, I had a wonderful group, you know their names: Berthet, Beaufay … They were really excellent people, but it was a very, very hard job for me because I had to do all the teaching of biochemistry for the medical students, to take all of the examinations which took me two months. I had administration, I had to find funds for this group and so on, and to direct a group that was getting bigger and bigger. It was a very, very big load and I found it a little difficult. And one day I visited George Palade, I was travelling in the United States and I was in his office and I said, My God, you are really fortunate, I wish I could work here. Just like that. George looked at me and he said, Do you mean this? I said, Yes George, I mean it. Six months later Detlev Bronk, the President of the Rockefeller University offered me a job.
Then came the complications because I wanted to work there and at the same time when the opportunity came, there was the problem of family, I could’ve taken my family with me, I had four children by that time, but there was also the problem of what would happen to my Belgian lab and so on. Bronk came to Louvain, talked to the director and finally they agreed, because suddenly the director of Louvain had discovered some qualities in me. I was relieved of most of my academic duties in Louvain and I was accepted by both, to share about 50% of my time between the two, that’s how I was able to start a new lab at Rockefeller. But this was supposed to be for five years and I’m still commuting today. It became permanent. But it was a crazy business, I mean to run two labs on each side of the Atlantic, nobody would say that’s a good way of doing science. But I had so many good co-workers that it was possible. I would always take one of my Belgian co-workers with me to New York. When I went back to Belgium he would keep on. We were able to do in New York, thanks to the Rockefeller, a large amount of work that I would not ever have been able to do. Now perhaps since you were talking about my career, perhaps I should add one more thing, if you don’t mind. Namely that I changed again, I’ve changed my field twice since. In 1975 I opened this new institute in Brussels, the ICP, which is a small biomedical research institute more or less copied on Rockefeller but on a much smaller scale. I went back to medicine, finally to medical research through that institute. Then in the last 10-15 years I have found new interest with origin of life and evolution.";618;Future research
Has the Nobel Prize changed your career in some way to the better or the worse?;"I would be completely dishonest if I said it had not changed my career. First of all, it was a tremendous pleasure when I got it, a tremendous encouragement. We all like recognition and we all know that we’ve done some good work and that we may be candidates, but as you know very well, there’s a big distance between being a candidate and being a laureate. And there is an element of chance there also. Sometimes I tell people, I think I won the big lottery. They say no, you’re being much too modest. I say but the tickets are very expensive. Anyway, to get back to your question, it has changed my life in many ways. I think it has made a number of things easier, at least in Belgium it has made it easier for me to get some funding and support for my new institute which was opened just the day I came back from Stockholm, so that was very helpful. It certainly has given me personally a certain amount of visibility which one may or may not enjoy. Certainly it has given me opportunities to do things, like being invited to conferences and symposium and so on. All that I would say was rather positive.
The negative aspects, in the United States for instance, I had a feeling it was more difficult to get financial support for some wild reasons that I don’t know, but anyway I had some problems. Maybe my science was not so good anymore. Then of course one wastes a lot of time because of all these things like being interviewed for television, things like that. I would say that perhaps what I would consider the most negative aspect about Nobel Prizes, and now I’m being really very serious, is that within the scientific community it establishes a distance between individuals that is not deserved. Within the scientific community there are many scientists who I consider just as good, if not better than me. I know many who could’ve shared the prize with me and did not share it. As you know some of the people, the unlucky candidates, who do not become laureates can suffer very much. I think it’s a pity within the scientific community to create this kind of super class of scientists who have this little Nobel badge and are greeted everywhere like being very special, although they are just the same as all the others. I think that’s dangerous. Since we’re talking about the Nobel Foundation here, I think there is a redeeming aspect to this. Namely, within the scientific community, maybe it’s a pity that something like the Nobel Prize exists, but for the relationship of the scientific community in the outside world, I think the Nobel Prizes have been tremendous because somehow they have caught the collective imagination of the world. The respect for Nobel Prize winners, which is not deserved, anyway becomes translated in the general public into some kind of respect for science. I think in this way the Nobel Foundation, by giving those high prestige prizes, have probably done an enormous amount of good for the visibility of science within the general community, for the appreciation by every people, not enough perhaps, but to some extent of the importance and the significance of science.";618;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Welcome to the Nobel interview, Professor François Jacob. You have written earlier that the Nobel Prize has changed your life, not only in a positive way, you also realised that it put some kind of burden on your back.;"The group we had in the Pasteur Institute with Lwoff, Monod and several people was rather unknown of the French public. We had a lot of foreign students; American students, British, German and so on and so forth, but very few French students. This group was ignored of the French authorities and French university and suddenly at one certain Thursday at noon the news arrived that you were awarded the prize and it worked like a wave. I mean all the newspaper, all the TV which were around in Paris just came there, and it was just like a wave you receive in full face. And then from being completely unknown we became too much known very rapidly, and it’s a bit difficult for a time to face this situation but you finally can do it.";640;Impact of the Nobel on you
So, what happened?;So what happened that we go on working, and it has also positive thing in the sense that you can more easily get support for your work, that you can more easily get good students and so forth. So you have a good side and a bad side on this of course.;640;Creativity
Yes. You were not only unknown, you were also kind of hidden in the attic of the Pasteur Institute.;That’s right, the attic was … Lwoff made some very important discovery before the war and he was made head of the department in the Pasteur Institute and the department which was created for him, which was bacterial physiology and he was given this attic on one of the buildings of the Pasteur Institute and when I arrived after the war I knew nothing in science. I had been wanting to do surgery and I was very heavily wounded and I had a bad arm and bad leg so I couldn’t do surgery and I tried to be an actor, I tried to do journalism, I did a lot of things and finally I tried to go into science but, as I said, I knew nothing in science and I decided that I’d give me five years, either I find something in five years or I do something else.;640;Career Development
And when was it?;This was in 1950. But the point is I learned that there were two good labs in Paris and one which was nicer than the other. The nicer one was the one which was headed by Lwoff and in which Monod was working, at the Pasteur Institute, and it was already at the Pasteur Institute, and I went and saw Lwoff and asked him whether I could work with him and he said No, I have no room, and for a year I came every month asking him whether I could work with him and finally he was so fed up with me that he said Yes and this was in the middle of 1950, yes.;640;Creativity
So you ended up on this attic?;So ended up in this attic and the attic was very interesting because it was a long corridor, at one pole there was Lwoff and his group, at the other was Monod and his group, and in the middle people were always meeting, talking, discussing, trying to put down the experiment of the other and criticising each other. It was extremely lively and extremely active and in this attic a large number of foreign people, as I said, was coming every year. So it was fantastically intellectual living place.;640;Career Development
Yes, and you had also many contacts with the American scientists?;Yes, there were many American scientists coming in, either professor for sabbatical year or post doc students.;640;Motivation
And you used also to go to Cold Spring Harbor?;Yes, I went to Cold Spring Harbor for the first time in 1953 and it was very interesting. I mean the students and the whole atmosphere was very different from what was existing in France.;640;Life
In what way?;In France when the professor had said something the student said Ok, well good, very good and in the States it was very funny. They were criticising strongly the professors and arguing with them. It was a very different climate but very interesting and when we went there in the States we tried to import in Europe, in France anyway, the American way of teaching and all this, yes.;640;Environment
How do you remember Jacques Monod and André Lwoff as persons?;"They were very different from each other, although Lwoff was some kind of an artist, actually he liked also to paint and he painted a lot and he had the intuition of the important problems. When he started with certain scientific problem and he went deeply in, but when you arrive at a certain success and a certain discovery then he stopped and he changed and went to another problem and he changed; I don’t know four, five times in his life and every time very successfully. He started with the vitamins and he explained what vitamins was and he came to viruses and bacteriophages showing that the genes of a virus can become part of a bacteria gene chromosome. Then he turned to other viruses, so changed he a lot.
Monod was completely the opposite. If he stared in one problem, which were his doctoral thesis then he went on all his life going deeper and deeper on this particular problem. So they were completely different but extremely good friends.";640;Creativity
And you were the third one I would say in this trio, the youngest one and what kind of scientist are you?;"Oh, I wonder. I was in the middle. I worked with Lwoff finally after this, but I said that I’d be going every month to him. Finally, he told me one day, You know we have found the induction of the prophage. I said, Oh. I was very admirative, but I didn’t understand a word of what he was saying and when I came out of that I just went to library and I couldn’t find out what a prophage or induction of a prophage was. Finally, I understood later on, but I told him: I am dying to do that with you, and so he accepted me and I began to work there. So I worked with him and did my thesis with him but after that I worked with Elie Wollman, who was just a little bit older than I was and we worked on the genetics of bacteria and we were able to analyse the whole genetic system, the way bacteria can copulate.  It was a system which had been found by Josh Lederberg and we analysed in detail.
… that was my role – to be in between and put the two things together …
But once we had this system in hand it was clear that it was a fantastic tool to analyse any function of the bacterial cell. So it turned out that it was important for the kind of problem that Monod was investigating, which was how the genes activity respond to environment, that our system of bacteria copulation was a very good tool to analyse that so I turned and worked with Monod at that time. And it turned out a very funny thing that Monod was working at one side on enzymes and disease and Lwoff was working on viruses and it turned out that the system were extremely similar, extremely alike and then you could make a general model of the way gene activity is regulated by using either system, that was my role – to be in between and put the two things together.";640;Motivation
"Yes, in one corridor. You did also write about the way science works and you use these words that you can divide science in two parts; one is day science and one is night science. Can you elaborate a bit on that?";That’s right. When you look at books or you look at papers people write you find that science is a nice treat, that you can go from one point to another in a very classical way and very profound way but I don’t think it’s the way science is. In fact, by night, when you are in your bed and you don’t sleep you wonder what you are doing, you hesitate to do this, is what I do reasonable? And it has nothing to do with the habitual description of the glory that you have, “la jardin française”, where you can walk, it’s very different from that and that’s what I call day science, which is the finished science, that’s what you look in the books and the night science which is the actual way when you fight with everything and wonder and being sure to be wrong, in fact.;640;Creativity
This time in science where you entered it in 1950s, this was really a time of revolution in biology. How do you view the development of biology since then?;"Well, there are two points which are important I think. One was that going on with the success beginning of molecular biology was to work with bacteria and viruses because it was very simple. You could analyse very simply and you could find a lot of mutants, you could make a lot of combinants, you could go to the genetic material itself, find out how it works; that was very nice and extremely successful. But when you wanted to apply these techniques to higher organisms, actually we were interested in ourselves finally, you couldn’t do that, and it became possible through genetic engineering and genetic engineering came out in the beginning of the 1970s.
It happened that you could isolate DNA, sequence DNA, pick up a gene, look at the presence of a gene, put him in a different organism or bacteria. You could do a lot of things, and then this gave access to higher organisms, that was essentially at the 1970s, and it became possible at the beginning of 1980s to tackle another absolutely fundamental problem of biology, which is embryonic development. That is how does it happen that you take a sperm cell, an egg cell, put them together, you have an egg and this gives two cells, four cells, eight cells and this gives you or me, that’s really the most fantastic problem you can imagine, that you have this four cells, eight cells; and then you have a small part which happened which has become distinct, a group of cells which is going to give the brain with which you learn to talk, to write, to come to Stockholm or to go through the street.
This was just impossible to believe 20 years ago …
This was really one of the big mysteries and it was impossible to handle seriously before this genetic engineering was possible and this we have learnt a lot and we have learnt incredible things, things which were completely incredible 20 years ago. For instance, that the same genes which make the plan of an insect, of a “drosophile”, the fly, the same gene make the plan for a human being or mouse or well … This was just impossible to believe 20 years ago.";640;Future research
Can you see something that will come? Can you speculate on that?;No. I mean I am not Madam Soleil. In France we have a very famous predictor who’s called Madam Soleil, Mrs Sun, and she sees anything, you can say “n’importe quoi” but if you make prediction you’re sure to be wrong, that’s the only thing you can say. Except one thing that probably the brain will be the main… because the brain is the thing which know the least and probably this will be the main object of the coming year.;640;Life
You have had a long scientific career, and I know that you have thought a lot about how science is being performed and also have written once an article with the title Forgetfulness in Science.;"Yes.I’ve come across serious examples of forgetfulness repeatedly in relation to my own work. First example, I think, was in relation to the work for which Alan Hodgkin and I had shares in the prize of 1963 and though that work was about the mechanism by which a nerve conducts its impulse. And just before the war, when I had just finished undergraduate work, I accompanied Alan Hodgkin to the Marine Laboratory at Plymouth to do experiments on this giant nerve fibre that squids have so we could put an electrode down inside. And we found that the action potential, the change of electric potential inside the fibre, was very much bigger than we’d expected or than was possible under the current theory.
On the current theory the inside potential should have gone from negative to approximately zero, we found it went substantially positive. And at that time, we had no explanation and we got onto the right explanation in 1945, which is that the membrane becomes momentarily a very permeable to sodium ions which are positively charged and they’re much more concentrated outside cells than inside. So when the membrane became permeable, these irons diffused in making it go positive inside.";647;Career Development
So you have something like the electricity?;Where that generated the electric change that’s been, well its existence has been known for about a hundred years and it was only after that the we came across a paper by Overton, an English scientist who worked first in Germany and then in Sweden. actually at Lund, and this was published in 1902 with the title in Germany on the Indispensability of Sodium or Lithium Irons for the Contraction of Muscle and how muscles work as their regards their excitability, they’re very similar to nerve. If we had known of this paper in 1939 I am sure we would have immediately realised what it was that made the inside of the fibre go positive.;647;Creativity
Why was not his paper famous?;He tried to repeat the experiment on nerve as well as on muscle and it didn’t work. He could put it in a sodium free solution and the nerve would go on working for hours. But actually in that paper he gave the correct explanation which seems not to have been accepted – I don’t know why – which is that every nerve, a group of a large number of nerve fibres, but each actual nerve is surrounded by sheath which holds the sodium salts in around the fibres. This sheath had been known from 1870 another paper in the 1890s, and Overton refers to this but nevertheless the work got forgotten. I don’t really know how, but anyway that was my first example.;647;Career Development
So how would you explain that there is such regular forgetfulness in science? Is it too much work or it’s just wrong time to get out?;"Certainly in some of the other, well one or two of the other examples I have in mind, it’s due to a new discovery which becomes popular and overshadows other aspects of the particular topic and causes the old ideas to be, well, I don’t know whether one should say just forgotten or suppressed. After Hodgkin and I had finished our work on nerve, we couldn’t see what to do next in relation to nerve. Huge advances dependent on discoveries, improvement in electronics and on, well, the development of molecular genetics, Watson and Cricks work and everything that followed from it, that was all later, so we couldn’t see what to do and I moved into muscle.
… we immediately saw some things that were contrary to what was in all the text books …
And I’ve always had an interest in microscopy and I developed a new sort of microscope for looking at living muscle isolated muscle fibres and our voluntary muscle, each fibre is crossed by little bends that you can see with the microscope. And we immediately saw some things that were contrary to what was in all the text books and my collaborator Dr Niedergerke from Germany remembered that he had come across some papers of the mid-19th century, notably by Kraus about the striations …";647;Career Development
So they were like 100 years old?;"Yes, nearly a 100 years old, 1870, and we were doing this in the early 1950s and I followed this up and beautiful work showing the things that Niedergerke and I had discovered and been surprised by, which lead on to the current theory of muscle contraction, which is that there are two lots of filaments that slide past each other. And another great coincident at that time is that this same theory was reached by a namesake of mine, Hugh Huxley, no detectable relative, by a quite different approach by electron microscopy. But as regards the old work being forgotten, I think the main reason why it was forgotten is the rise of classical biochemistry which got going round about 1900.
Influential papers say contractility must be a molecular process, you can’t see molecules with a light microscope, which is perfectly true, but then drawing the conclusion that you won’t learn anything from what you can see with the light microscope which as it happens is not true because there’s this larger scale of things representing well the lengths of these filaments which are clearly visible in the microscope. They were first seen by van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century and this was what we had been measuring and dutiful measurements had been made back in the 19th century, Kraus notably Engelmann but this got forgotten because primarily I think because of the switch of interest to the molecular level.";647;Creativity
So this sounds like there was space on it for one idea at the time, you don’t have two ideas in parallel?;Yes, the same thing happened in relation to genetics. I’ve not been personally involved in this but of course there was Darwin’s theory published in 1859 and by the end of the 19th century that was universally accepted that evolution was mostly due to natural selection, survival of the fittest. But then Mendel’s papers on the mechanism of heredity were rediscovered in 1900 and the science of genetics was started by that and the early geneticists insisted that evolution was driven by the particular mutations that happened to happen and this was the generally accepted idea and for 30 years after that rediscovery, Darwinian natural selection was, well not entirely disregarded, but the majority of people in the field did not think of it as the important thing.;647;Research
But this sounds also that the young people that are fostered into doing research and into science they are also fostered to be quite opportunistic.;Yes, well that’s natural and inevitable. Because it’s difficult to make the history of science interesting to the young, it’s very difficult to avoid making it seem that people who had well what are believed that any one time to be wrong ideas, it’s difficult not to make it appear that those people were stupid. I mean, well, ideas like flogiston and so on tend to be laughed at. But at the time they were very reasonable.;647;Motivation
I would like to ask you about your family, your father, your grandfather, two of your half-brothers are very famous persons, can you tell us something about them?;"Yes, well, my grandfather was T H Huxley, Thomas Henry Huxley, commonly known as’ Darwin’s bulldog’ and notable for defending Darwin in the controversies, that were very strong for a short time after the publication of On the Origin of Species, they didn’t go on very long in The Origin of Species, the only reference I think to possible human origin is in the final sentence where I think Darwin says: Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history or something of that kind.
But it was obvious to everybody that the implication was that we are descended from apes and Darwin had avoided this topic because he knew it would be controversial, but he published a full length, very important book called The Descent of Man only just over 10 years later, I think, it was published in 1870, and the storm was over by then. And in 1880 my grandfather gave a lecture which was published in printed form entitled The Coming of Age of the Origin of Species, it was 21 years after the publication and he says it’s now difficult to realize the strength of feeling that there was in the first few years, these things now seem like prehistoric discussions and I think it’s not often realised how short lived the serious objections were.";647;Life
Arthur Kornberg, welcome back to Stockholm again, another family get-together in Stockholm. You were here with your son Roger when you received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 and now you’re back to see him receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry this year, the sixth father/son team to do this. It must be very pleasant to be back?;Yes, it’s a great, great pleasure to be resurrected after all these years through Roger’s awesome achievements. He’s done things that I could have dreamed of but never accomplished and without going into great detail, he’s moved from biochemistry, taking genetics along with it and onto structural studies of crystallography and x-ray defraction which he learned entirely on his own and put this piece together. That is, I would say, perfectly awesome. Very proud.;655;Impact of Nobel prize on you
In some ways your beginnings were similar in that you both came from a chemistry background and when I spoke with Roger yesterday he was saying that chemistry was really the fundamental thing you needed to know in order to understand biology and he said that in very elegant terms. I presume, since you majored in chemistry yourself, that you’d agree with him totally?;"That’s not quite correct. Roger has had, I might say, almost a royal training in chemistry because I arranged, during his high school and college years, to spend summers working with distinguished chemists and biochemists and geneticists. I never had that background. When I entered college, I didn’t know what I would do. When I left college, I had a chemistry major but a very mild one and almost by defect, went into medicine. Medicine was not chemical and trained as an internist after medical school and really came into chemistry by a wide detour. Shall I go on and tell you the…?
When I was given leave to complete my clinical training after 1941, outside of war. I then in July of that year was mustered into the coastguard as a doctor and I was then part of a navy and so I was on ships for about six months, as the doctor on the ship. Then through some devious way in which some research that I’d done as a medical student gained me an invitation to come to the National Institute of Health. I was assigned to rat nutrition, which I did for three years. Then got bored with feeding rats and counting the sick and dead ones, became convinced that I needed to understand what vitamins did, which I was feeding them and keeping some alive including folic acid as an important component and gained a special dispensation from the NIH, still in uniform, to work in an entomology laboratory of Severo Ochoa, who later I shared the prize with in 1959. He was very kind and patient and I learned the rudiments and then progressed to doing something more meaningful. Then he persuaded me, and I didn’t need that much persuasion, to borrow another half year from the NIH, still in uniform, to work with two Nobelists later, Carl and Gerty Cori in St Louis. That was again a major episode that utterly separated me from ever returning to medicine, let alone things that are more physiological. Returning to the NIH, I then took up a privilege that had been given to me to start a laboratory of entomology and from there on, I’ll say briefly, I fell in love with enzymes.";655;Motivation
Your path really took you from an applied approach to research back to a very basic approach. I’ve read that you described your approach to physiology as being to isolate the actors with which you can then investigate the dramas they perform. That’s a direct quote from you.;Aren’t you nice to remember that?Yes, and I still find that in essence what one needs to do, faced with a biologic event, but I’ve come around in recent years to appreciate that that’s only part of the story. That one has ultimately to put it into the context of a functioning entity, a cell, because many of the players have been eliminated in that reduction to simplicity of an enzyme reaction or even an enzyme pathway. And also, I’ve been persuaded that even with bacteria, which I’ve worked with almost all my life, that they have a defined ultra structure, they’re not simply a bag of enzymes, but unfortunately it’s too late in life to make up for all that lost ground but it’s part of our future in biology and science.;655;Career Development
Sure, but despite your being persuaded that there’s more than the reductionist approach, which of course you knew, there is nevertheless I think now quite a rush towards in vivo work. And does that, do you think confuse issues, the fact that people want to get into the animal as quickly as they can?;It’s worse than that. In trying to see a broad picture, the power of genomics and proteomics and metabolomics and economics. All of that has contrived to separate people from what I’d say the wet nature of life. We may pick this up later, the subject that I’m working on intensely now, or try to. I appreciate how little has been done at that level of breaking the cell open perturbing it minimally, but still being able to introduce and extract things from that broken cell, that has a world of mystery in it.;655;Environment
In thinking about the appeal of science to people coming into the subject, do you think that the move towards genomics and metabolomics and the rest of it, has in some way distanced people from the ability to become excited by science?;Oh, I can’t comment on that. People doing the current work and sitting at the front of their computers, which is now commonplace in my lab and department, and not over an ice bucket with chilled reagents and pipetting from one to another. They’re so different and I’m not prepared to say that this generation has gone off the deep end, but it will have to come back. I don’t think any system as refined as genomics can be, and I’ve used it because it’s so informative about other aspects of living systems that relate to what you’re doing. Still the urgency, let’s say in Roger’s work, which I won’t for a moment denigrate in any way. But when I’ve talked to him about the subject that I’m interested in and I told you I’d get to it, polyphosphate, it’s there, /- – -/ in abundance but they’re not in the reduced, refined, almost atomically resolved system for which he’s getting this highly deserved credit. So that’s your mode and who might be doing that kind of work. I had breakfast with Dave Bushnell, a very devoted and highly capable research associate of Roger’s and checked with him, David, is anyone even thinking about that, oh no, it’s another world.;655;CPS
Tell us a little bit about the work that you’re currently doing then?;"I didn’t think you’d get around to asking me so soon. I don’t want to extend this, as you said earlier, having in many people’s minds the image of a molecular fossil. But in fact let me reflect on when I first heard the word. It was in the laboratory of Carl and Gerty Cori in 1947. It was that second interval or half year bonus that I had to study entomology. A Belgian came through, Wiame, and he brought the news that a particle had been known from the turn of the century, called Viatine, which had the property of metachromatic staining. It was prominent in many organisms, abundance and less so. No one knew what it did. They had discovered in that Belgian laboratory that it was inorganic polyphosphate. At that time, the nature of those bonds which are high energy phosphor and hydroid bonds, we didn’t know about mitochondria. We knew about ATP but in 1947, we didn’t know about mitochondria and immediately set to wonder, could this inorganic polyphosphate be somehow involved in the generation of ATP. As it turned out, that was not a part of the picture. ATP and ATP synthase and ultimately the proton motive force that drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP was elucidated and the ATP synthase, the enzyme because better known and polyphosphate was forgotten.
In fact, when I was in St Louis, about that time, it coincided with an asbestos scare. People were being diagnosed and dying from asbestosis, which was being used to coat all kinds of ducts and insulating infants clothing from fire. It was a determined that people were dying of asbestosis, a pulmonary disease in the shedding of the asbestos from industrial and even domestic use. Monsanto set about to replace asbestos with some mineral fibre and that was polyphosphate and you could make polyphosphate, much like it was made on Earth billions of years ago, by heating phosphate rock and you get long chains of polyphosphate. The cost was pennies a pound and so they developed very good technology for making fibrous constructions out of this polyphosphate. Until the marketing people said it won’t sell, it won’t go because it’s a fibre. The fact that it’s biodegradable in your body and nature and the fact now that it’s used in making meats resistant to bacteria, packed meats commonly had polyphosphate. They glisten as a result of it and many dental flosses, toothpastes have polyphosphate. It’s utterly innocuous but it has origins and has kinds of either utter indifference or even fear that’s made its marketing and acceptance so delayed.";655;Research
So, polyphosphates are with us all the time, despite the fact that scientifically they’ve been somewhat ignored?;"More than that, I conjecture, no-one knows how life started but I would think polyphosphate would have been an ideal candidate for the first vesicle that surrounded something and called a cell because it’s a phosphorylating agent, it helps in the creation of peptides and fatty acids, it’s a reservoir of energy, it makes ATP, it phosphorylates sugars and it’s responsive to the environment. It grows and recedes of course by adding enzymes and permeases and what not, but enough of that. But incidentally, people who write about the origin of life and speculate about it, rarely mention polyphosphate, isn’t that astonishing?
Yes, exactly, but long before there was an RNA world or a carbon word, poly P was there. And the fact is, and this is what persuaded me, polyphosphate is in every cell in nature. Every bacterium, fungus, plant, every animal, every tissue, every sub-cellular element in a cell, in the nervous system, it’s chains of thousands and it’s in the nuclei, the mitochondria, attached to the ribosomes, a variety of vesicles, it’s everywhere.";655;Creativity
You see it now as a very good candidate for a drug target in microbiology?;I came about, I should say, blossomed. We then made our bug as E. coli. We’ve done so much with it and DNA replication and we could show that when we deprive this bacterium of these enzyme, we established the enzyme that makes it called PPK, polyphosphate kinase, converts ATP, takes the phosphate ATP, puts it on a growing chain and it just whizzes off and we really don’t know the intimate details of how that process goes from one to many. We were able to purify the enzyme, characterise it and make mutants of it. We found very early on that they didn’t survive. They might grow through the typical expediential phase, but they couldn’t survive and then they couldn’t swim. They couldn’t talk to each other and make biofilms and eventually we moved more towards Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a fascinating organism, and found that it was not pathogenic and that’s a bad bug because it kills children with cystic fibrosis, with pneumonia. It’s the bane of surgeons because it causes wounds that cannot be healed and it makes such firm biofilms.;655;Creativity
Biofilms are another area that hasn’t been very investigated.;"Biofilms is what bugs behave in almost 98% of the time. They’re not simple little rods or spheres, they collect under a variety of circumstances and aggregate as a film, which they have totally different properties and very resistant to antibodies. Anyway, you need poly P, we’ll call it poly P then, shall we, to make biofilms and pseudomonas, that is deprived of the kinase that makes polyphosphate is no longer pathogenic. We’re not sure that’s true, salmonella, shigella, vibrio cholerae, helical bacteria that forms peptic ulcers /- – -/ for cancer. Each of these when we isolate the enzyme, mutate it, these bugs no longer are pathogens. Which brings me to my current involvement, which is really current, I’ve been in touch with people several days last week, tuberculosis. It so happens that mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent that causes tuberculosis, has firstly the same enzyme as the one in E. coli, that enzyme has been conserved in terms of its amino acid chain almost intact.
That enzyme could be a target and we arranged some years ago through friends and contacts, to have a company call ICOS in Washington, near Seattle, to screen libraries for their capacity of hundreds of thousands of compounds to inhibit that enzyme with a very high affinity. Found many, many, more important they had 62 compounds that they could play with and this may not, digress for a moment, two things happened in that history of … that’s socially interesting, their Chief Scientific Advisor of ICOS, very good friend of mine, Stanley Falkow at Stanford advised that the FDA, The Federal Drug Administration, likely wouldn’t approve a drug that wasn’t killing bugs, it’s seen that polyphosphate was a bacteria static drug. I’m not sure, FDA has now for some time been happy to give approval to compounds that weaken the organism and could be used in conjunction with another drug. The second thing is that ICOS had a contract with Lilly to produce Cialis. Cialis is the Viagra drug and two weeks ago, Lilly bought out ICOS for two billion dollars and just dissolved the company. Anyway, so polyphosphate didn’t do well on either score…";655;Creativity
Except you have your candidate molecules.;But the tubercle bacillus, and this comes now very recently, there are two groups in India, Datta, Santanu Datta, who’s at the AstraZeneca in Bangalore and Kundu, now I can’t remember, it’s M, rather a long name, in Bose Institute in Calcutta and they’ve been showing now something extraordinary. Tuberculosis is difficult to treat because it has such a long growth period, not minutes and hours but days and weeks and then it needs a given level of ATP to keep growing and polyphosphate is essential for that. So PPK, which we understand very well is a wonderful target and the face of a global problem of drug resistant tuberculosis, kills millions in underdeveloped countries or India and incompromise people, immunologically compromise. So that’s what I mentioned was the current, the excitement at the level of marketing. Marketing, by that I mean giving advice and there’s a global alliance that the Gates Foundation has and another group, again Gates sponsored for diarrhoeal diseases that kill children. Anyway, we’ve gotten away from science, but not really.;655;Research
No, no, not at all. The ICOS story in particular raises the spectre of biotech and the enzymes you discovered are at the very heart of the biotechnology industry and you yourself have been very intimately involved in it. Would it be fair to ask you what influence you think biotech has had on the practice of life science?;I’ve written about that and whatever I’ve written is probably changing or has changed a lot. As you mentioned, I was involved in starting a biotech company or two and was with them and to date I’m on the board of directors of Xoma, which is a biotech company. I’d say that biotechnology, in fact, Thomas Friedman who writes op-ed articles for the New York Times, three times a week I always read Tom Friedman. I don’t know him and I don’t write letters to the editor but in this case, I thought there was an occasion when he talks about global problems, which he does. The occasion was to mention that biotech was important now and would be even more so in dictating the practice of medicine and all kinds of real life problems and he wrote me a note saying thank you for your letter and I haven’t heard that he’s mentioned anything like that since. Biotech by definition, it’s etymology, it’s a hybrid of biology and technology and they really don’t belong together. Biology, we want to find out how nature is put together and how it operates, we don’t want to be annoyed with what use to which that information can be put, exaggerated. Technology is, can we get a market or marketable product to use this information for the public welfare and to make a profit? They’re really socially distinct but yet they do blend in some very meaningful ways. Biology is basic to what technology can do to define the molecules, the enzymes, the targets, the receptors. Technology has done wonders for biology by providing and accelerating the genomics and the proteomics and the reagents we have and the instruments we have. There wouldn’t be a market for a very specialised instrument if it weren’t that the biotech industry drove it, so I say it could be a very happy marriage, but with care.;655;Role of Science
Do you think the climate of funding academic research is changing towards favouring?;It’s always in danger. I know this again intimately from recent days in which a very talented, accomplished post-doctoral fellow from Spain, Maria Rosario Gomez-Garcia. I’ve been trying very hard to get her a place to do research in Europe which she contributed enormously from her background and her ability, very tough, very tough. It isn’t simply maintaining the status of basic science is preventing an erosion of it that is frightening. I once wrote an essay for Science I think called ‘NIH Alma Mater’ because I wanted to give proper due to what the NIH did for me, to create me as a scientist and I’ve mentioned that I came from a coastguard and did rat research and until a couple of years ago, there was a drive and I tried to be helpful in that, to double the NIH budget. Now in doing so you realise there are twenty-seven disease institutes within the NIH, there’s one called GMS, General Medical Sciences, which has about one tenth of that budget or less. The other institutes are quite good too because they do have a reasonable regard for the basic chemistry and physiology that underlies cancer and heart disease and stroke. Now with this squeeze, the budget’s been reduced in effect because of the expansion of cost of technology and worst of all, people are running scared. My NIH grant was terminated a year ago. It was a very mild, small grant and people increasingly, one of my son’s, Roger’s younger brother, who does excellent work on the development of Drosophila, had three modest grants. They were terminated and he’s now been able to wangle, wangle might be a good word, two back to a moderate level but not to support his research programme which was vigorous. So, with the threat of losing support, people make more applications, and the applications are increasingly safe rather than adventurous.;655;Environment
…and think about the almost 50 years since you were awarded the Nobel Prize and I’d like to ask you what you think the influence of the Nobel Prize is on the subject in which it’s awarded, so in particular in medicine and physiology, how do you think the Nobel Prize influences the progresses of research?;"I would hope and I’m going to be daring, that it has no influence on the investigator. That’s of course extreme. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry, I have a special liking for that because in a number of cases, someone’s been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and the chemist don’t even know because it’s been a tradition that the committee regards biochemistry as a form of chemistry. In Roger’s case, he was trained as a chemist and I don’t think there’s any confusion about that but my colleague, a very close colleague and former post-doc of mine, Paul Berg got a prize in chemistry for recombinant DNA. Chemists in the major departments, Stanford, Harvard, Yale, anywhere, never heard of it.
I wouldn’t say large but a reasonable percentage. So that’s going very well. The medicine prize, with which I’m much more familiar, has on occasion gone to someone who’s done something notable or saleable or in the news without a sufficient background in the fundamentals of that discovery or any future beyond that award and I’m not going to name them, there are very few, very, very few.";655;Impact of Nobel prize on you
That’s for another day. I think you were going to use the word notoriety there and I wanted to ask you whether you have any advice for your son about how to balance the notoriety that the prize would bring?;I don’t have anything to offer him in the way of advice. From the time he was a youngster, he knew what he wanted to do and all I could do was watch it and admire it. I saw him a few minutes ago and he seemed worn and tired and concerned about the wear and tear that’s been going on for two months.;655;Meaning(Values) of Work
Your Nobel Prize is of course associated with a couple of interesting numbers. This is the hundredth time, I am sure you’ve heard, that the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded and also this is the first time ever that two women have been co-recipients of the same Nobel Prize in the sciences, and telomere research in general is one where the proportion of women is more normal, if you like, its more representable of the maked up society. Is there a reason for that, do you think?;Elizabeth Blackburn: I think we should turn it around and ask why everybody else is so aberrant, seriously, because I think that actually might frame the question a little bit more instructively as to why things are not, as you said, the biological or societal representation of women. We can point to various sorts of things such as the fact that some of who have been in the field are females, but actually there are plenty of men in the field as well and I think what stands out is that the numbers are a little different, but certainly, having examples of women who have done well in science – we all know that kind of example does make it more encouraging for others, younger people, to visualize themselves being successful in science – and so I think there has been a kind of perpetuating effect there, but I do like to think that this is the normal way it can be and perhaps we should think about, well, how do we make this more normal in other fields of science.;535;Diversity in Science
We will pick up your question, why is it aberrant in other fields do you think?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: Somebody else can take that one.
Jack Szostak: There is obviously a lot of historical reasons, bias, familiar /- – -/ that takes a long time to get rid of and a lot of good role models to get rid of.";535;Motivation
Have you found it difficult being a woman in science?;Carol Greider: No, I have not found it difficult, but I think that one of the things that I have always done is sort of put blinders on and done what I wanted to do, but it was when I then started to get to the higher levels in ranks that I could then look back and see what the data was. At graduate school there were 50% women, at graduate school there was postdoc fellows usually 50% and then as you get higher and higher up the representation is lower. I didn’t feel like I personally had experienced any big obstacles, I am a scientist, I can look at the data and see that there is something that is not quite representative, as one moves up the higher ranks. I think that role models are one good thing, that the more people there are in the higher ranks the more the younger people can look up and say Yes, there is something that I can do, and it doesn’t seem like an impossible task.;535;Advice for female scientists
Is there more that needs to be done than role models? I mean, would it naturally change, or does it have to be aggressively tackled do you think?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I think aggressive tackling is good. Look at something like smoking, it took very aggressive actions to make smoking less of a wide-spread practice and certain amount of imposition of things. I don’t think it will happen organically completely from within. When you talk to colleagues, individually they are very well disposed to the idea that they see the value of having more women and more diverse groups of people’s insights, because like any enterprise the more diverse sorts of backgrounds come into it, the better way the problems can be solved. I think there is not a lack of good will among a lot of people to do this. It is a question of how do you do it, and then I am sure a mixture of various sorts of strategies will be hopeful, not least education and not least just seeing a woman there sort of makes it more possible. I think we are very visual species, and you look at something and that’s evidence in front of you, that you seem to think Oh, that’s me. If you were a young woman, I could do this.
I think further that we have to make the career structure a little bit more flexible because there has been a one size fits all model for careers in science which have been very much that based on a man having a supportive wife or partner or something to take care of life and family and that’s been something that has been daunting, we find, to young women. I personally found it very daunting as a young woman into the career structure, not the science, but the career structure, and so I think we can be much more imaginative about how we make sure women don’t leave sciences during the time when they have preoccupations with family or with elderly parents who need long term care, the sort of things that women often do.";535;Mentors (Role models)
Yes, that requires one to have really quite a strong support structure within science.;"Jack Szostak: A lot more broadly than that, there are a lot of things done here in Sweden that would be kind of chocking in the United States.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, absolutely!
Carol Greider: A support in terms of general /- – -/ support.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, because I think the seeking point for many women, at least in my personal experience from what I see is, they say “I just can’t see being a scientist and I also do want to have a life” and I think that that is something that we shouldn’t say to young people. “Oh no, you can’t have a life and be a scientist” and yet that is the perception that they have. I think as senior scientists we could do a lot more to try to think of active ways in which this one kind of career structure model that we have could be thought of more imaginatively. And I just know examples of women who have gone part-time as their families and other needs have happened, and then they go back in full time and they just come roaring back and have done really well, and they are not all in the United States unfortunately, which again tells us something about the United States situation and support.";535;Environment
I think it’s your own phrase … I have heard you say it. They were known in the 1930s, it was known that they had an important protective role of the chromosomes, but people didn’t know what they were. It was you in the late 1970s that sorted out the molecular nature.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: Began to, its still an on-going saga, none of us are out of jobs yet. That’s right. I think it was so wonderful the science that was done /- – -/ genetically in which such deductions were made about what’s going on with chromosomes and their inheritance. Now we look back at it and we say they didn’t know it was DNA and yet the thinking about what was observed, and I particularly enjoyed McClintock’s work because that’s what I got more familiar with. It was so elegant and there are so many treasures in there, of insights into what turns out to be going on in meiosis and as it turned out with what’s going on with telomeres, although her fame more broadly was, I think, perhaps more for jumping genes for many years. What she said, something written in 1931, about a telomere being distinctive, and she didn’t call it a telomere, was so clear and I think very important and it was just lack of the research tools of the time.
Jack Szostak: Molecular understanding was there …
Elizabeth Blackburn: Right they had microscopes, they had genes, phenotypes, they had really wonderful other kinds of thinking, but they were not playing with the same sort of toys in the lab that we have played with.";535;Creativity
Ahead of time … Then you two met at this Gordon conference in 1980 and it’s sort of the way science is supposed to happen, two people meet each other, have an idea, do an experiment and prove something wonderful.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: And then … nobody pays for it, but they do pay for it, no they pay for a broad sort of setting in which you can go and do experiments and explore and ask questions without somebody saying, Oh, is this going to be useful for this year’s economy or for somebody’s /- – -/ medicine. I think that is really important, I mean we thought that was something … we didn’t really think about it at the time, it was such a given that you can do an experiment with broad funding that is never going to be wasted. Scientists don’t throw away money, they work very hard and giving scientists money to ask questions that hadn’t been planned, it’s really important.
Jack Szostak: That meeting, or that kind of meeting, it’s great for bringing people together, who are working on different things.
Elizabeth Blackburn: These meetings are famous for …
Carol Greider: You had met each other before?
Jack Szostak: No, that’s how we met. After your talk I came up …
Elizabeth Blackburn: We walked across this lawn and just talked and talked.
Jack Szostak: Because I was working on broken DNA molecules’ ends and then Liz had these ends that behaved completely differently, and it was just a contrast that was kind of chocking so we had to talk about it and see what we could do to figure out what was going on.
Carol Greider: So Liz, you gave your talk first?
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes.";535;Creativity
It was after the talk the two of you teamed up?;Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, I talked about what we knew about the molecular nature of these DNA molecules. You know the ends, you could get your hands physically on.;535;Creativity
We will turn to the experiment in a minute, but I just want to ask you in general about choosing companions in science, because it is so important to get the right people to work with. Is there some, and of course one works with lots of different people throughout one’s career, but are there some criteria that you applied choosing companions to work out with?;"Jack Szostak: I think it’s mostly a matter of, you know, is there an interesting experiment that actually can get done?
Elizabeth Blackburn: And then if you have the luxury of choice, yes, you do want to work with people who really do rigorous science, I think, and that can be very different kinds of science, can be done with rigour, but I think that’s important as one collaborates with people outside new areas. Jack and I, we were really much in the same sort of area, it was a molecular genetic tradition, but when you collaborate even further out, now you don’t have the deep expertise, then I think you have to have a real respect for that person’s quality of their research.
Jack Szostak: And you also need to have someone who is fun to talk to and you can exchange ideas with, each way. Some people are better at that than others. More fun to work with.
Elizabeth Blackburn: But you are right, if the scientist is really exciting you will make it happen.
Jack Szostak: You will find a way.";535;Competencies
And when you are picking companions who don’t have a track record, students that come in into the lab, what do you look for in them?;Carol Greider: Really, it’s just the excitement of what they are doing and they simply need to communicate that excitement back and forth and I think if people really are interested and care, just interacting with them over a period of a few weeks, one can tell whether or not there is a compatible set of interest that are there. So usually there is an opportunity to do that when students may be coming into the lab, you have a chance to get to know them a little bit and see where the capabilities are on both sides. It’s not just a mentor choosing a student for a very … there is opportunities for students to go around and choose mentors and make sure that they are compatible with them as well, and I think both of those things are important.;535;Competencies
I was going to go on to ask what do you think are the important characteristics of being a mentor, what do you try and provide for the student?;Carol Greider: Again, it’s all about the science and it’s about being a /- – -/, sit down and have a conversation and really understand that person’s interest. Some problems are very interesting, but somebody may approach it from a particular angle and somebody else approach it from a different angle and then when those two people talk it may not be as easy to understand, but a third angle, there may be a shared understanding like, you know, languages, if somebody speaks a language that is close to a language, if somebody speaks Italian and Spanish, maybe they will understand each other better than somebody speaking some other languages. So I think that that is true in terms of people in their interpersonal interactions as well, so finding those compatibilities is just a matter of spending some time together and talking about their science.;535;Mentors (Role models)
I don’t know if you want to add anything?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: And finding their strengths too, which is something I learned not by being clever, but somebody once said to me that Shirley Tilghman, who is now the President of Princeton, but she is a very accomplished molecular geneticist, and somebody who knew her very well in her science days said she always is very good finding what people are good at and then making sure that gets used very well. It’s not an altruistic thing necessarily, she is making sure they thrive and do the best in science and I thought that was a really good hint and I try and look for that as well because some people have real strengths in some areas, some will ask all these questions all the time and they will never do this experiment, but its also important that they are doing that. Others will say, Yes, I will do the experiment but also be critical. Carol was actually somebody in the latter, she said, “I will do the experiment” and be very smart and critical at the same time. But other people will question, question, question, and if you can make use of that and say, this is really good that someone’s bringing into their really critical thinking and not say, Well, I really want you to do it this way and stopping it, and think, Ah this person actually is smart and they probably got some good reasons for what they are thinking about and so try and use what strengths you feel you discern in people is important.
Jack Szostak: I like to find people who are pretty independent and have some initiative and the best students are the ones where I can tell them that’s never going to work and then they go and do it and show that it does work.
Elizabeth Blackburn: My problem is that I always think that it is going to work, and they are the ones who say, Well actually …. It goes both ways and you have to have both going on and you have to have the sort of Let’s try it, and things that you really have reasoned through very well, that sometimes is the route to doing something new as you reason something very well and you do that and then something new comes of that too, so both ways in biology really can work and you can’t always predict which is going to be the formula.";535;Future research
Presumably it often takes quite a long time to find out what people are good at, because there must be a lot of graduate students who start and then find they don’t hit the ground running, it takes time to get going. That can be quite a dissolution at time, so it’s important for people to understand it can take time for one to work out what one should be doing.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I think people’s quality of thinking that emerges relatively easily I think, now as you say what unfolds in the experiment can of course be very slow because you know by definition you are doing things that are difficult. If they are easy someone would have done them, and so that’s I think the hard, unpredictable road for graduate students. Back to your questions of mentoring, that’s were you have to realize that that’s going on and that people will go through periods in science as we all have done, when you’re just seeming to fail all the time and the experiments don’t work, sometimes for reasons that are boring, but sometimes for reasons that are significant. You have to be able to fail a lot of the time, scientists just have to be terrific at getting slapped back on the face by nature all the time.
Carol Greider: I have told my students and I am famous in the lab for saying “That’s why they call it research” because somebody would come into my office and we will be talking about an experiment with a great result and I say “Great, go and do it again!” Somebody would come into my office and say “Nothing worked at all, nothing worked at all”. “Great, go and try it again!” And I say that’s why it is called re-search, you always have to do it again.
Elizabeth Blackburn: I realized the opposite because somebody said it isn’t research because somebody already searched for the /- – -/ rediscovering it or something. I like yours better.
Carol Greider: You have to repeat that good experiment just like you have to try again at the failed experiment.";535;Advice  for young scientists
Yes, Carol’s is less depressing, yes. So back to the experiment, together you demonstrated that telomeres from one species could protect DNA from an entirely unrelated species and thus the mechanism of the telomere protection was more fundamental than perhaps one might have though initially. And that result was very clear, you understood that immediately so where you aware of what an important piece of information you had just discovered at the time?;"Jack Szostak: I think we knew that it was going to open up a lot of new experiments, because we could use all the tools available in yeast as well as you could do in Tetrahymena and then in other organisms. So we knew that it was going to allow more progress.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And I think it also felt somewhat fundamental in the sense … you know molecular biology was very dominated by there will be universal solutions for things because we were so influenced by the genetic code, DNA, everything was very universal and so when you saw something crossing lines of phylogenetic divisions … Don’t you think there was a bit of a sense when we found the sequences looked similar and they looked like there is something fairly deeply universal in the eucariotic world.
Jack Szostak: That is an important point, because it was already clear that in bacteria and many viruses there were lots of different solutions, so it didn’t have to turn out to be universal.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, it was completely nonintuitive what would go on in terms of actually more the replication problem in terms of … and protection too.";535;Meaning(Values) of Work
And you also observed that the telomeres in yeast were lengthening and that something had to be causing that lengthening and that’s when you come into the story, because you set out to find the activity that was causing the lengthening.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: By chemically speaking yes, because I thought that was … I am sort of a biochemist, somewhat by training I suppose and I had gone through biochemistry and then molecular biology and so it felt natural to try and say this is very direct, you know, reactions take place in real time sort of more or less in front of your eyes in sort of, you know, biochemical way.
Jack Szostak: You had the right organism for doing the right chemistry.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And the organism was right and it turned out … There was a biology of the organism that set this burst of telomere synthesis that takes place and there was an abundance, relatively speaking, of telomeres and so that all pointed to, well, this is a good system to try and answer questions and I had been trained in the lab of Joe Gall, which is where I actually did the sequencing of the telomeric ends, as we now call them, the DNA ends of the mini-chromosomes in the ciliated protozoans. Joe had very much always said that you should find this system in which you would answer the question best, what I think is a fundamental idea. Things will be pretty conserved throughout much of life and so this idea that find the good system was very much in my mind so I started out doing a little out of foray into things, got ten years, felt brave and Carol joined the lab and felt really brave.";535;Meaning(Values) of Work
She was one of your unusual students who took one of your ideas and said, Yes I can do that and off she went.;Elizabeth Blackburn: I had actually offered it to a postdoc who turned it down: Very nice Liz, but I think I will do something different. It was very politely, but.;535;Mentors (Role models)
And you got this now famous Christmas present in 1984, the first indication that you got your hands on the activity that was causing the lengthening of the telomeres.;"Carol Greider: Yes, I was doing experiments, it was about nine months of trying various things. Liz and Jack had proposed that there may be something that would lengthen the telomeres and so, not knowing exactly what that is or what the properties were. We would just try different things and Liz and I would talk to each other every day or so and say, Okay let’s try this, like cooking, you add some ingredients and you taste it and that doesn’t taste so good so you add a little bit more salt. After trying various things there was one particular change that I made in the experiment. I was just interested in … It was an exciting time to do an experiment and then a few days later, it would take several days for the experiment to sit on an autoradiograph and so I went back in on Christmas day to develop the results of the experiment that I had done several days before and that’s when I saw this very clear repeating pattern on the autoradiograph that just looked like a six-base repeating pattern that you would expect of a telomere repeat.
That first instinct is like, Wow, this might really be what we think, of course, then after the excitement there is the, Well, are we being fooled? And so then has to follow all of the ways where we would then be our own worst critics in a sense. It’s like how could we be being fooled by this? Maybe it’s really some normal polymerase that is copying something that is a repetitive sequence in the extract. So that is were the real work of the self criticism is very important and so that is why the discovery was Christmas 1984, but the paper was published in December -85.
Elizabeth Blackburn: It just shows how fast these things go actually.";535;Meaning(Values) of Work
It is an obvious point, but obviously you were enjoying yourself tremendously and going in on Christmas morning was just something that was natural and the enjoyment of what you do is key, is absolutely the essence of it. Its not work, its enjoyable, I presume.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: That’s right, it’s the best kept secret in science. We never tell people what fun we are having and maybe we are a little afraid because somehow society will frown upon the idea that you actually really … And yet at serious play, but it’s completely the element and the resources, I wonder what, because often the trajectory of the experiments, you find out something the next day because something has rather been incubating or autoradiograms exposing, things like this. There is often this thing where you would leave something and the next day come in and I have just been driving to Berkeley and I am driving up university avenue, really impatient because the traffic would get very slow off the free way, and you knew there would be something at the end of that university avenue when you got out of the car and went into the lab.
Carol Greider: That’s why I lived up on the hill and I came down on my bike.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, you came down on your bike fast, that’s right. And you had a Volkswagen once. At least you were on the bike, that’s good. But I think that’s really an important point because many young people are saying, Oh you know science is so hard, its so true, and we all complain bitterly because we just take completely for granted the fact that we are having such a good time so we sort of have the luxury to complain about the other stuff. But it’s a really good career and very autonomous, nobody tells us what to do in terms of our choice of research and when you think about how many jobs that’s true for it’s a mince and its not as if scientists waste money. We really are so driven, we want to find things.
Carol Greider: I remember when I was a graduate student and it was the first time that I was sort of on my own and supporting myself, and I was like, Wow, they are going to pay me to come in and play everyday ,and I was being paid now what would now be you know, but it was great and I thought Wow, this is just amazing. Maybe if I just keep it up, and it’s worked so far.
Elizabeth Blackburn: No, it’s true, as an Assistant Professor you’re suddenly given this playground. They really trust me to do this – that was my feeling. And Berkeley was very /- – -/ actually and they sort of really trust you to go out and … I think now mentorship in young peoples careers is much more thoughtfully done and maybe that’s not always good because we had huge freedom just as Assistant Professors, right?
Jack Szostak: We just had the resources to go.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, you have to gather the resources, but then you work really hard because you are just driven.";535;Creativity
Perhaps it’s too big a question to ask whether its changing for the good or for the bad. Its presumably going in both directions in the same time.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I think those who love science are still driven in the same way.
Jack Szostak: I don’t know, it might be, it probably takes more time and effort to raise the money to support lab. There are more frustrations there, maybe its more bureaucratic than it use to be, but if you really want to do it, you can still do it and then you have the luxury of doing whatever experiments you think are the most interesting.";535;Motivation
Okay, so back to the enzyme, the enzyme you discovered was unusual, it was a reverse transcriptase with extra protein and RNA and it took some time to sort all that out. When you did sort it out, it turned out that it solved the end replication problem because this problem had been laying around for a while unsolved of how DNA polymerase, well the fact that DNA polymerase could not, on its own, synthesize both chains of DNA to the end. And it seems strange that that problem had been there without anybody being able to solve it for quite a long time. DNA polymerase was revealed in 1958 by Kornberg and it was pointed out in what 1970 or so, 1972 by Watson and others, there was this problem. And it was the late 80s or mid 80s the solution came.;"Carol Greider: There were solutions in other organisms as Jack had alluded to, that various viruses … what wasn’t known was how the eucariotic chromosomes solved the problem and that did wait for the sequences, until Liz found the sequences you couldn’t really ask the question until you had the actual molecular details.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And there was some peculiarities about the sequences, there were different numbers of repeats of the ends of different molecules in a population of molecules. This wasn’t like viruses although there are some viruses in which they do have recombination at the ends and they have some end repeats as well, so there were solutions that looked very plausible, that the viruses of bacteria had already evolved to have. It was really various lines of evidence that sort of said, Aha, this does not seem to be the kind of solution that new eucariots have.
Jack Szostak: But if you go back and read all our early papers we were through a lot of models, they were mostly based on recombination-like mechanisms and we held on to those to the bitter end until the sequences said that can’t possibility be.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Because people could draw beautiful diagrams, right, and the literature was, you did …, I don’t know how to draw beautiful ones. No but there was definitely some ideas out there and some of them have turned out to be quite applicable actually to some viruses and stuff like that, so the ideas were not completely useless.
Carol Greider: … applicable to telomerase in theory, as well.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes!
Jack Szostak: Yes, that’s right.
Carol Greider: There really were two answers, it’s just that one turned out to be a little bit more dominant then the other.
Elizabeth Blackburn: A lot more dominant.
Carol Greider: A lot more dominant, yes!
Elizabeth Blackburn: As almost universal eucariots, with exceptions, and exceptions are always instructive, that is sort of the richness of the question because there is such a lot that goes on in what seems very simple, but technically a different chromosome, it sounds like you just stick a fortress around and that’s okay, but its much more interesting and dynamic than one had thought, which again makes it fascinating.";535;Meaning(Values) of Work
It is fascinating, is it interesting because one tends to tell the story of science in retrospect as being a problem followed by a solution and its not quite that, is it? Its much more complicated.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: And often observations come and then they are what you expect and then you start thinking about them and what they might mean and then realize, Yes, that might be providing a solution to something. You know it doesn’t happen in …
Carol Greider: But there are also possible solutions that aren’t correct, or pursue things, that’s not how they found out, that’s not how it works and you go back and pursue a different angle and what you end up hearing about historically is those things that were correct, so it seems like a linear path when actually it was a branch in a tree of which were interesting ideas. They just didn’t turn out to be how it actually worked.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes! Or at least not in that situation.
Carol Greider: Yes, that particular situation.
Jack Szostak: And also you get a solution to say the problem that you were thinking very originally, but once you have that solution you realize, Oh, now there is three other problems you hadn’t even thought of before and so it goes. And that is really true in the case of like human telomeres where the biochemistry is unbelievably complicated.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And yet there is an inevitability to the complexity because people say, Well, if you want a very robust sort of system it has to be inherently complex and so suddenly it makes sense in a way that we didn’t think of. We really simplified the question where we just said, we are just going to think about the DNA and the enzyme that does it and just so, you have to do that, I think, up to a point, you have to take away the irrelevancy, but always knowing that it is taking place in a cell, an incredibly complex entity which is a cell inside an incredibly complex identity which is, in our case a human, and yet you can take these things and sort of push them up to a point and then you have to realize when you have to take the blinders off, that’s the key. But again, the inherent complexity of it, its not like a curse, its sort of like, This is the way it is, because the really interesting reasons why systems have to be that way and yet we have to, on the other hand, sort of reject the complexity at certain stages in the research.";535;Motivation
20 years on you are still working on telomeres and telomerase and sorting out the system and one thing that … Oh yes, I am coming to Jack, I’m coming back to that. One aspect that is growing up is the therapeutic implications of the fact that telomere shortening was seen to be associated with the disease states and indeed the maintenance of telomere length in both directions seems to be important, maintained equilibrium is important. What do you feel are the potential therapeutic benefits of studying telomerase and telomeres?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: It is usually divided into two general categories, one is the rather hyperactive telomerase that characterizes the great majority of human cancers, on the other hand the telomerase that is presents in much more regulated form in the natural cells of the body. The normal cells, the telomerase is present in much more regulated form in normal cells of the body and various indications, such as the associations you mentioned of short telomeres with many disease states or risks of it that’s intriguing this genetic data in cases of insufficient telomerase action which says that clearly is not good for humans to not have enough telomerase in their normal cells that have to replenish to decades of adult life if we are fortune enough to move past our re-productive years and we are looking at old age, we are interested in what our health is like for that. So understanding what’s going on in cells at this fundamental level, I think you really do understand this, just to understand what’s going on in the trajectory of humans as we age, because all of the social and other settings are now letting us age, we have this sort of unexpected biological reality to live with, so we are understanding that first of all.
Now, are there quick-fixers magic pills? Not tomorrow, but maybe there is interesting things that could keep telomerase a little more active, but you have to be careful and I like to think it’s like aspirin, you take two aspirins – good – take a bottle, that’s bad. Clearly any measure would have to be carefully thought through how you would, if you want to keep telomere maintenance better, not to push it too far, because too much telomerase can help cancer cells, but I mean, really a lot to much. Then the question of course is can you exploit the high telomerase in cancer cells to selectively target cancer cells and there is beginning efforts in industry to do very early stages, to look at these kinds of things. But I think just understanding what’s going on is actually really important in understanding human ageing.
Carol Greider: And it’s not just telomerase, because one of the things that we have learned in the research over the years is really that’s the short telomeres that cause the end effect and as Jack has mentioned, any time you ask a question and you find out the answer there is many more other questions to ask. There are various regulatory mechanisms that allow the telomere length to be maintained at a certain equilibrium and telomeres is essential to provide the raw material to do that, but both the telomere is regulated as well as the proteins that are on the telomeres, that the telomeres has to interact with. I think that really understanding those details of all of the components and the complexity that goes in to the regulation will tell us a lot about these diseases, these age related degenerated diseases that may not be just telomerase related but they may be a number of other genes that one can look at that may be associated with these degenerated diseases that aren’t directly the telomerase, so there is a lot of interesting avenues to pursue still, to really understand the different directions these diseases may come from.";535;Meaning(Values) of Work
Because there was a great deal of therapeutic excitement about telomerase and telomeres early on and there still is. Was there an initial kind of pressure on you suddenly, that everybody was getting excited about the potential? Does it make life difficult if people’s expectations are a little bit too elevated early on?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I work in the basic science area, so I felt immune from that.
Carol Greider: It’s all the companies that have to worry about that kind of expectations because we never really said as scientists that there was going to be that kind of therapy to come in tomorrow because we didn’t have the vested interest to be doing that.
Elizabeth Blackburn: I think it is good to have these avenues explored for sure and I think that the fact that it hasn’t gone all that fast is actually not to do with the science or other sorts of things. In the meantime it’s really important to try and understand what is going on because any therapeutic is going to be all the better for having a better sense of what underlies the usefulness and where its danger points might be. It’s not clear how we think about these issues of long term diseases that affect huge numbers of people, you don’t necessarily put everybody on statins, that’s a common thing, but perhaps that equivalent isn’t necessarily the best way to go either, although we tend to be a very ‘take a pill’ oriented society and nothing wrong with that, I mean. I am all for western medicine, believe me, but I am just saying that we don’t want to limit our thinking I think to that …
Jack Szostak: And jump into something too quick and not recognize a problem.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Exactly, that’s right.";535;Creativity
I wanted to end just by dealing with these questions of staying with your subject or not. You two have stayed with the subject …;Carol Greider: That’s debatable, the subject really has changed continuously;535;Creativity
I am sorry, the subject expands…;"Carol Greider: Yes, I was a biochemist you know and now I am working on recombination and human disease and various other things.
Elizabeth Blackburn: I work with clinicians on chronic psychological stress, but the point is I am not the expert. I bring my expertise and they bring theirs, so it stays very fresh by keeping one’s expertise that you really have. Now interfacing with other expertise’s so it’s actually a very broad topic. Anything that says our cells are going to be able to keep replenishing got a lot of broad implications even though we are focused on one part of it.";535;Career Devleopment
Maybe I will discover my questions completely redundant, but let’s say you two are at least following the questioning in the same general vein and yes, it’s taking you to new places. You, on the other hand, have seemed to jump from one question to another, but there is almost a clear break between one question and the next and they seem from the outside the two different ways to do science. One is to say, There is a problem, I will work on it for a while and then I will look for another problem, actively go and find a different problem. Would that be fair to say?;Jack Szostak: I think you could find lots of examples of people who you know have one system and they use it to address lots of different questions and that can be extremely productive and then there are other people who just like to find interesting questions in different areas and go for it.;535;Creativity
But what I was going to ask was what for you is the attraction of jumping from question to question.;Jack Szostak: Well its fun to think about new things, get into an area where you don’t really know very much so you don’t have to be fooled by the preconceptions that might dominate the field so you might have a chance of making a contribution in a different way. So that is part of the attraction.;535;Creativity
Is there also an attraction in going to less populated places?;"Jack Szostak: For me, I don’t like to be working in an area where there are a lot of other people who are going to do the same experiment at the same time or a few months later. I find it more fun to be doing something that is probably unique.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And that’s what telomeres were initially to. Nobody was asking these questions and it is a the most fun way to do science actually. I agree with you.
Jack Szostak: In the mid or late 1980s I think the implications of all the telomere work were becoming clear and it was I think clear that a lot of people would be going into that field and so I think that helped to make me look around for other areas and all the stuff about ribozymes was very new and exciting and I was very surprised that there were very few people going into that area so I thought that we might …
Carol Greider: You had already got the Nobel Prize by that time?
Jack Szostak: That was 1989 and we started working on it in actually -85.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And how life begins, I mean that’s a pretty important question.
Jack Szostak: It’s a lot of questions when you start to break it into pieces, it’s a lot of interesting questions, so that has come to dominate what we do today.";535;Research
Your Nobel Prize is of course associated with a couple of interesting numbers. This is the hundredth time, I am sure you’ve heard, that the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded and also this is the first time ever that two women have been co-recipients of the same Nobel Prize in the sciences, and telomere research in general is one where the proportion of women is more normal, if you like, its more representable of the maked up society. Is there a reason for that, do you think?;Elizabeth Blackburn: I think we should turn it around and ask why everybody else is so aberrant, seriously, because I think that actually might frame the question a little bit more instructively as to why things are not, as you said, the biological or societal representation of women. We can point to various sorts of things such as the fact that some of who have been in the field are females, but actually there are plenty of men in the field as well and I think what stands out is that the numbers are a little different, but certainly, having examples of women who have done well in science – we all know that kind of example does make it more encouraging for others, younger people, to visualize themselves being successful in science – and so I think there has been a kind of perpetuating effect there, but I do like to think that this is the normal way it can be and perhaps we should think about, well, how do we make this more normal in other fields of science.;536;Diversity in Science
We will pick up your question, why is it aberrant in other fields do you think?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: Somebody else can take that one.
Jack Szostak: There is obviously a lot of historical reasons, bias, familiar /- – -/ that takes a long time to get rid of and a lot of good role models to get rid of.";536;Motivation
Have you found it difficult being a woman in science?;Carol Greider: No, I have not found it difficult, but I think that one of the things that I have always done is sort of put blinders on and done what I wanted to do, but it was when I then started to get to the higher levels in ranks that I could then look back and see what the data was. At graduate school there were 50% women, at graduate school there was postdoc fellows usually 50% and then as you get higher and higher up the representation is lower. I didn’t feel like I personally had experienced any big obstacles, I am a scientist, I can look at the data and see that there is something that is not quite representative, as one moves up the higher ranks. I think that role models are one good thing, that the more people there are in the higher ranks the more the younger people can look up and say Yes, there is something that I can do, and it doesn’t seem like an impossible task.;536;Advice for female scientists
Is there more that needs to be done than role models? I mean, would it naturally change, or does it have to be aggressively tackled do you think?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I think aggressive tackling is good. Look at something like smoking, it took very aggressive actions to make smoking less of a wide-spread practice and certain amount of imposition of things. I don’t think it will happen organically completely from within. When you talk to colleagues, individually they are very well disposed to the idea that they see the value of having more women and more diverse groups of people’s insights, because like any enterprise the more diverse sorts of backgrounds come into it, the better way the problems can be solved. I think there is not a lack of good will among a lot of people to do this. It is a question of how do you do it, and then I am sure a mixture of various sorts of strategies will be hopeful, not least education and not least just seeing a woman there sort of makes it more possible. I think we are very visual species, and you look at something and that’s evidence in front of you, that you seem to think Oh, that’s me. If you were a young woman, I could do this.
I think further that we have to make the career structure a little bit more flexible because there has been a one size fits all model for careers in science which have been very much that based on a man having a supportive wife or partner or something to take care of life and family and that’s been something that has been daunting, we find, to young women. I personally found it very daunting as a young woman into the career structure, not the science, but the career structure, and so I think we can be much more imaginative about how we make sure women don’t leave sciences during the time when they have preoccupations with family or with elderly parents who need long term care, the sort of things that women often do.";536;Mentors (Role models)
Yes, that requires one to have really quite a strong support structure within science.;"Jack Szostak: A lot more broadly than that, there are a lot of things done here in Sweden that would be kind of chocking in the United States.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, absolutely!
Carol Greider: A support in terms of general /- – -/ support.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, because I think the seeking point for many women, at least in my personal experience from what I see is, they say “I just can’t see being a scientist and I also do want to have a life” and I think that that is something that we shouldn’t say to young people. “Oh no, you can’t have a life and be a scientist” and yet that is the perception that they have. I think as senior scientists we could do a lot more to try to think of active ways in which this one kind of career structure model that we have could be thought of more imaginatively. And I just know examples of women who have gone part-time as their families and other needs have happened, and then they go back in full time and they just come roaring back and have done really well, and they are not all in the United States unfortunately, which again tells us something about the United States situation and support.";536;Environment
I think it’s your own phrase … I have heard you say it. They were known in the 1930s, it was known that they had an important protective role of the chromosomes, but people didn’t know what they were. It was you in the late 1970s that sorted out the molecular nature.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: Began to, its still an on-going saga, none of us are out of jobs yet. That’s right. I think it was so wonderful the science that was done /- – -/ genetically in which such deductions were made about what’s going on with chromosomes and their inheritance. Now we look back at it and we say they didn’t know it was DNA and yet the thinking about what was observed, and I particularly enjoyed McClintock’s work because that’s what I got more familiar with. It was so elegant and there are so many treasures in there, of insights into what turns out to be going on in meiosis and as it turned out with what’s going on with telomeres, although her fame more broadly was, I think, perhaps more for jumping genes for many years. What she said, something written in 1931, about a telomere being distinctive, and she didn’t call it a telomere, was so clear and I think very important and it was just lack of the research tools of the time.
Jack Szostak: Molecular understanding was there …
Elizabeth Blackburn: Right they had microscopes, they had genes, phenotypes, they had really wonderful other kinds of thinking, but they were not playing with the same sort of toys in the lab that we have played with.";536;Creativity
Ahead of time … Then you two met at this Gordon conference in 1980 and it’s sort of the way science is supposed to happen, two people meet each other, have an idea, do an experiment and prove something wonderful.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: And then … nobody pays for it, but they do pay for it, no they pay for a broad sort of setting in which you can go and do experiments and explore and ask questions without somebody saying, Oh, is this going to be useful for this year’s economy or for somebody’s /- – -/ medicine. I think that is really important, I mean we thought that was something … we didn’t really think about it at the time, it was such a given that you can do an experiment with broad funding that is never going to be wasted. Scientists don’t throw away money, they work very hard and giving scientists money to ask questions that hadn’t been planned, it’s really important.
Jack Szostak: That meeting, or that kind of meeting, it’s great for bringing people together, who are working on different things.
Elizabeth Blackburn: These meetings are famous for …
Carol Greider: You had met each other before?
Jack Szostak: No, that’s how we met. After your talk I came up …
Elizabeth Blackburn: We walked across this lawn and just talked and talked.
Jack Szostak: Because I was working on broken DNA molecules’ ends and then Liz had these ends that behaved completely differently, and it was just a contrast that was kind of chocking so we had to talk about it and see what we could do to figure out what was going on.
Carol Greider: So Liz, you gave your talk first?
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes.";536;Creativity
It was after the talk the two of you teamed up?;Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, I talked about what we knew about the molecular nature of these DNA molecules. You know the ends, you could get your hands physically on.;536;Creativity
We will turn to the experiment in a minute, but I just want to ask you in general about choosing companions in science, because it is so important to get the right people to work with. Is there some, and of course one works with lots of different people throughout one’s career, but are there some criteria that you applied choosing companions to work out with?;"Jack Szostak: I think it’s mostly a matter of, you know, is there an interesting experiment that actually can get done?
Elizabeth Blackburn: And then if you have the luxury of choice, yes, you do want to work with people who really do rigorous science, I think, and that can be very different kinds of science, can be done with rigour, but I think that’s important as one collaborates with people outside new areas. Jack and I, we were really much in the same sort of area, it was a molecular genetic tradition, but when you collaborate even further out, now you don’t have the deep expertise, then I think you have to have a real respect for that person’s quality of their research.
Jack Szostak: And you also need to have someone who is fun to talk to and you can exchange ideas with, each way. Some people are better at that than others. More fun to work with.
Elizabeth Blackburn: But you are right, if the scientist is really exciting you will make it happen.
Jack Szostak: You will find a way.";536;Competencies
And when you are picking companions who don’t have a track record, students that come in into the lab, what do you look for in them?;Carol Greider: Really, it’s just the excitement of what they are doing and they simply need to communicate that excitement back and forth and I think if people really are interested and care, just interacting with them over a period of a few weeks, one can tell whether or not there is a compatible set of interest that are there. So usually there is an opportunity to do that when students may be coming into the lab, you have a chance to get to know them a little bit and see where the capabilities are on both sides. It’s not just a mentor choosing a student for a very … there is opportunities for students to go around and choose mentors and make sure that they are compatible with them as well, and I think both of those things are important.;536;Competencies
I was going to go on to ask what do you think are the important characteristics of being a mentor, what do you try and provide for the student?;Carol Greider: Again, it’s all about the science and it’s about being a /- – -/, sit down and have a conversation and really understand that person’s interest. Some problems are very interesting, but somebody may approach it from a particular angle and somebody else approach it from a different angle and then when those two people talk it may not be as easy to understand, but a third angle, there may be a shared understanding like, you know, languages, if somebody speaks a language that is close to a language, if somebody speaks Italian and Spanish, maybe they will understand each other better than somebody speaking some other languages. So I think that that is true in terms of people in their interpersonal interactions as well, so finding those compatibilities is just a matter of spending some time together and talking about their science.;536;Mentors (Role models)
I don’t know if you want to add anything?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: And finding their strengths too, which is something I learned not by being clever, but somebody once said to me that Shirley Tilghman, who is now the President of Princeton, but she is a very accomplished molecular geneticist, and somebody who knew her very well in her science days said she always is very good finding what people are good at and then making sure that gets used very well. It’s not an altruistic thing necessarily, she is making sure they thrive and do the best in science and I thought that was a really good hint and I try and look for that as well because some people have real strengths in some areas, some will ask all these questions all the time and they will never do this experiment, but its also important that they are doing that. Others will say, Yes, I will do the experiment but also be critical. Carol was actually somebody in the latter, she said, “I will do the experiment” and be very smart and critical at the same time. But other people will question, question, question, and if you can make use of that and say, this is really good that someone’s bringing into their really critical thinking and not say, Well, I really want you to do it this way and stopping it, and think, Ah this person actually is smart and they probably got some good reasons for what they are thinking about and so try and use what strengths you feel you discern in people is important.
Jack Szostak: I like to find people who are pretty independent and have some initiative and the best students are the ones where I can tell them that’s never going to work and then they go and do it and show that it does work.
Elizabeth Blackburn: My problem is that I always think that it is going to work, and they are the ones who say, Well actually …. It goes both ways and you have to have both going on and you have to have the sort of Let’s try it, and things that you really have reasoned through very well, that sometimes is the route to doing something new as you reason something very well and you do that and then something new comes of that too, so both ways in biology really can work and you can’t always predict which is going to be the formula.";536;Future research
Presumably it often takes quite a long time to find out what people are good at, because there must be a lot of graduate students who start and then find they don’t hit the ground running, it takes time to get going. That can be quite a dissolution at time, so it’s important for people to understand it can take time for one to work out what one should be doing.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I think people’s quality of thinking that emerges relatively easily I think, now as you say what unfolds in the experiment can of course be very slow because you know by definition you are doing things that are difficult. If they are easy someone would have done them, and so that’s I think the hard, unpredictable road for graduate students. Back to your questions of mentoring, that’s were you have to realize that that’s going on and that people will go through periods in science as we all have done, when you’re just seeming to fail all the time and the experiments don’t work, sometimes for reasons that are boring, but sometimes for reasons that are significant. You have to be able to fail a lot of the time, scientists just have to be terrific at getting slapped back on the face by nature all the time.
Carol Greider: I have told my students and I am famous in the lab for saying “That’s why they call it research” because somebody would come into my office and we will be talking about an experiment with a great result and I say “Great, go and do it again!” Somebody would come into my office and say “Nothing worked at all, nothing worked at all”. “Great, go and try it again!” And I say that’s why it is called re-search, you always have to do it again.
Elizabeth Blackburn: I realized the opposite because somebody said it isn’t research because somebody already searched for the /- – -/ rediscovering it or something. I like yours better.
Carol Greider: You have to repeat that good experiment just like you have to try again at the failed experiment.";536;Advice  for young scientists
Yes, Carol’s is less depressing, yes. So back to the experiment, together you demonstrated that telomeres from one species could protect DNA from an entirely unrelated species and thus the mechanism of the telomere protection was more fundamental than perhaps one might have though initially. And that result was very clear, you understood that immediately so where you aware of what an important piece of information you had just discovered at the time?;"Jack Szostak: I think we knew that it was going to open up a lot of new experiments, because we could use all the tools available in yeast as well as you could do in Tetrahymena and then in other organisms. So we knew that it was going to allow more progress.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And I think it also felt somewhat fundamental in the sense … you know molecular biology was very dominated by there will be universal solutions for things because we were so influenced by the genetic code, DNA, everything was very universal and so when you saw something crossing lines of phylogenetic divisions … Don’t you think there was a bit of a sense when we found the sequences looked similar and they looked like there is something fairly deeply universal in the eucariotic world.
Jack Szostak: That is an important point, because it was already clear that in bacteria and many viruses there were lots of different solutions, so it didn’t have to turn out to be universal.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, it was completely nonintuitive what would go on in terms of actually more the replication problem in terms of … and protection too.";536;Meaning(Values) of Work
And you also observed that the telomeres in yeast were lengthening and that something had to be causing that lengthening and that’s when you come into the story, because you set out to find the activity that was causing the lengthening.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: By chemically speaking yes, because I thought that was … I am sort of a biochemist, somewhat by training I suppose and I had gone through biochemistry and then molecular biology and so it felt natural to try and say this is very direct, you know, reactions take place in real time sort of more or less in front of your eyes in sort of, you know, biochemical way.
Jack Szostak: You had the right organism for doing the right chemistry.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And the organism was right and it turned out … There was a biology of the organism that set this burst of telomere synthesis that takes place and there was an abundance, relatively speaking, of telomeres and so that all pointed to, well, this is a good system to try and answer questions and I had been trained in the lab of Joe Gall, which is where I actually did the sequencing of the telomeric ends, as we now call them, the DNA ends of the mini-chromosomes in the ciliated protozoans. Joe had very much always said that you should find this system in which you would answer the question best, what I think is a fundamental idea. Things will be pretty conserved throughout much of life and so this idea that find the good system was very much in my mind so I started out doing a little out of foray into things, got ten years, felt brave and Carol joined the lab and felt really brave.";536;Meaning(Values) of Work
She was one of your unusual students who took one of your ideas and said, Yes I can do that and off she went.;Elizabeth Blackburn: I had actually offered it to a postdoc who turned it down: Very nice Liz, but I think I will do something different. It was very politely, but.;536;Mentors (Role models)
And you got this now famous Christmas present in 1984, the first indication that you got your hands on the activity that was causing the lengthening of the telomeres.;"Carol Greider: Yes, I was doing experiments, it was about nine months of trying various things. Liz and Jack had proposed that there may be something that would lengthen the telomeres and so, not knowing exactly what that is or what the properties were. We would just try different things and Liz and I would talk to each other every day or so and say, Okay let’s try this, like cooking, you add some ingredients and you taste it and that doesn’t taste so good so you add a little bit more salt. After trying various things there was one particular change that I made in the experiment. I was just interested in … It was an exciting time to do an experiment and then a few days later, it would take several days for the experiment to sit on an autoradiograph and so I went back in on Christmas day to develop the results of the experiment that I had done several days before and that’s when I saw this very clear repeating pattern on the autoradiograph that just looked like a six-base repeating pattern that you would expect of a telomere repeat.
That first instinct is like, Wow, this might really be what we think, of course, then after the excitement there is the, Well, are we being fooled? And so then has to follow all of the ways where we would then be our own worst critics in a sense. It’s like how could we be being fooled by this? Maybe it’s really some normal polymerase that is copying something that is a repetitive sequence in the extract. So that is were the real work of the self criticism is very important and so that is why the discovery was Christmas 1984, but the paper was published in December -85.
Elizabeth Blackburn: It just shows how fast these things go actually.";536;Meaning(Values) of Work
It is an obvious point, but obviously you were enjoying yourself tremendously and going in on Christmas morning was just something that was natural and the enjoyment of what you do is key, is absolutely the essence of it. Its not work, its enjoyable, I presume.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: That’s right, it’s the best kept secret in science. We never tell people what fun we are having and maybe we are a little afraid because somehow society will frown upon the idea that you actually really … And yet at serious play, but it’s completely the element and the resources, I wonder what, because often the trajectory of the experiments, you find out something the next day because something has rather been incubating or autoradiograms exposing, things like this. There is often this thing where you would leave something and the next day come in and I have just been driving to Berkeley and I am driving up university avenue, really impatient because the traffic would get very slow off the free way, and you knew there would be something at the end of that university avenue when you got out of the car and went into the lab.
Carol Greider: That’s why I lived up on the hill and I came down on my bike.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, you came down on your bike fast, that’s right. And you had a Volkswagen once. At least you were on the bike, that’s good. But I think that’s really an important point because many young people are saying, Oh you know science is so hard, its so true, and we all complain bitterly because we just take completely for granted the fact that we are having such a good time so we sort of have the luxury to complain about the other stuff. But it’s a really good career and very autonomous, nobody tells us what to do in terms of our choice of research and when you think about how many jobs that’s true for it’s a mince and its not as if scientists waste money. We really are so driven, we want to find things.
Carol Greider: I remember when I was a graduate student and it was the first time that I was sort of on my own and supporting myself, and I was like, Wow, they are going to pay me to come in and play everyday ,and I was being paid now what would now be you know, but it was great and I thought Wow, this is just amazing. Maybe if I just keep it up, and it’s worked so far.
Elizabeth Blackburn: No, it’s true, as an Assistant Professor you’re suddenly given this playground. They really trust me to do this – that was my feeling. And Berkeley was very /- – -/ actually and they sort of really trust you to go out and … I think now mentorship in young peoples careers is much more thoughtfully done and maybe that’s not always good because we had huge freedom just as Assistant Professors, right?
Jack Szostak: We just had the resources to go.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, you have to gather the resources, but then you work really hard because you are just driven.";536;Creativity
Perhaps it’s too big a question to ask whether its changing for the good or for the bad. Its presumably going in both directions in the same time.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I think those who love science are still driven in the same way.
Jack Szostak: I don’t know, it might be, it probably takes more time and effort to raise the money to support lab. There are more frustrations there, maybe its more bureaucratic than it use to be, but if you really want to do it, you can still do it and then you have the luxury of doing whatever experiments you think are the most interesting.";536;Motivation
Okay, so back to the enzyme, the enzyme you discovered was unusual, it was a reverse transcriptase with extra protein and RNA and it took some time to sort all that out. When you did sort it out, it turned out that it solved the end replication problem because this problem had been laying around for a while unsolved of how DNA polymerase, well the fact that DNA polymerase could not, on its own, synthesize both chains of DNA to the end. And it seems strange that that problem had been there without anybody being able to solve it for quite a long time. DNA polymerase was revealed in 1958 by Kornberg and it was pointed out in what 1970 or so, 1972 by Watson and others, there was this problem. And it was the late 80s or mid 80s the solution came.;"Carol Greider: There were solutions in other organisms as Jack had alluded to, that various viruses … what wasn’t known was how the eucariotic chromosomes solved the problem and that did wait for the sequences, until Liz found the sequences you couldn’t really ask the question until you had the actual molecular details.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And there was some peculiarities about the sequences, there were different numbers of repeats of the ends of different molecules in a population of molecules. This wasn’t like viruses although there are some viruses in which they do have recombination at the ends and they have some end repeats as well, so there were solutions that looked very plausible, that the viruses of bacteria had already evolved to have. It was really various lines of evidence that sort of said, Aha, this does not seem to be the kind of solution that new eucariots have.
Jack Szostak: But if you go back and read all our early papers we were through a lot of models, they were mostly based on recombination-like mechanisms and we held on to those to the bitter end until the sequences said that can’t possibility be.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Because people could draw beautiful diagrams, right, and the literature was, you did …, I don’t know how to draw beautiful ones. No but there was definitely some ideas out there and some of them have turned out to be quite applicable actually to some viruses and stuff like that, so the ideas were not completely useless.
Carol Greider: … applicable to telomerase in theory, as well.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes!
Jack Szostak: Yes, that’s right.
Carol Greider: There really were two answers, it’s just that one turned out to be a little bit more dominant then the other.
Elizabeth Blackburn: A lot more dominant.
Carol Greider: A lot more dominant, yes!
Elizabeth Blackburn: As almost universal eucariots, with exceptions, and exceptions are always instructive, that is sort of the richness of the question because there is such a lot that goes on in what seems very simple, but technically a different chromosome, it sounds like you just stick a fortress around and that’s okay, but its much more interesting and dynamic than one had thought, which again makes it fascinating.";536;Meaning(Values) of Work
It is fascinating, is it interesting because one tends to tell the story of science in retrospect as being a problem followed by a solution and its not quite that, is it? Its much more complicated.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: And often observations come and then they are what you expect and then you start thinking about them and what they might mean and then realize, Yes, that might be providing a solution to something. You know it doesn’t happen in …
Carol Greider: But there are also possible solutions that aren’t correct, or pursue things, that’s not how they found out, that’s not how it works and you go back and pursue a different angle and what you end up hearing about historically is those things that were correct, so it seems like a linear path when actually it was a branch in a tree of which were interesting ideas. They just didn’t turn out to be how it actually worked.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes! Or at least not in that situation.
Carol Greider: Yes, that particular situation.
Jack Szostak: And also you get a solution to say the problem that you were thinking very originally, but once you have that solution you realize, Oh, now there is three other problems you hadn’t even thought of before and so it goes. And that is really true in the case of like human telomeres where the biochemistry is unbelievably complicated.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And yet there is an inevitability to the complexity because people say, Well, if you want a very robust sort of system it has to be inherently complex and so suddenly it makes sense in a way that we didn’t think of. We really simplified the question where we just said, we are just going to think about the DNA and the enzyme that does it and just so, you have to do that, I think, up to a point, you have to take away the irrelevancy, but always knowing that it is taking place in a cell, an incredibly complex entity which is a cell inside an incredibly complex identity which is, in our case a human, and yet you can take these things and sort of push them up to a point and then you have to realize when you have to take the blinders off, that’s the key. But again, the inherent complexity of it, its not like a curse, its sort of like, This is the way it is, because the really interesting reasons why systems have to be that way and yet we have to, on the other hand, sort of reject the complexity at certain stages in the research.";536;Motivation
20 years on you are still working on telomeres and telomerase and sorting out the system and one thing that … Oh yes, I am coming to Jack, I’m coming back to that. One aspect that is growing up is the therapeutic implications of the fact that telomere shortening was seen to be associated with the disease states and indeed the maintenance of telomere length in both directions seems to be important, maintained equilibrium is important. What do you feel are the potential therapeutic benefits of studying telomerase and telomeres?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: It is usually divided into two general categories, one is the rather hyperactive telomerase that characterizes the great majority of human cancers, on the other hand the telomerase that is presents in much more regulated form in the natural cells of the body. The normal cells, the telomerase is present in much more regulated form in normal cells of the body and various indications, such as the associations you mentioned of short telomeres with many disease states or risks of it that’s intriguing this genetic data in cases of insufficient telomerase action which says that clearly is not good for humans to not have enough telomerase in their normal cells that have to replenish to decades of adult life if we are fortune enough to move past our re-productive years and we are looking at old age, we are interested in what our health is like for that. So understanding what’s going on in cells at this fundamental level, I think you really do understand this, just to understand what’s going on in the trajectory of humans as we age, because all of the social and other settings are now letting us age, we have this sort of unexpected biological reality to live with, so we are understanding that first of all.
Now, are there quick-fixers magic pills? Not tomorrow, but maybe there is interesting things that could keep telomerase a little more active, but you have to be careful and I like to think it’s like aspirin, you take two aspirins – good – take a bottle, that’s bad. Clearly any measure would have to be carefully thought through how you would, if you want to keep telomere maintenance better, not to push it too far, because too much telomerase can help cancer cells, but I mean, really a lot to much. Then the question of course is can you exploit the high telomerase in cancer cells to selectively target cancer cells and there is beginning efforts in industry to do very early stages, to look at these kinds of things. But I think just understanding what’s going on is actually really important in understanding human ageing.
Carol Greider: And it’s not just telomerase, because one of the things that we have learned in the research over the years is really that’s the short telomeres that cause the end effect and as Jack has mentioned, any time you ask a question and you find out the answer there is many more other questions to ask. There are various regulatory mechanisms that allow the telomere length to be maintained at a certain equilibrium and telomeres is essential to provide the raw material to do that, but both the telomere is regulated as well as the proteins that are on the telomeres, that the telomeres has to interact with. I think that really understanding those details of all of the components and the complexity that goes in to the regulation will tell us a lot about these diseases, these age related degenerated diseases that may not be just telomerase related but they may be a number of other genes that one can look at that may be associated with these degenerated diseases that aren’t directly the telomerase, so there is a lot of interesting avenues to pursue still, to really understand the different directions these diseases may come from.";536;Meaning(Values) of Work
Because there was a great deal of therapeutic excitement about telomerase and telomeres early on and there still is. Was there an initial kind of pressure on you suddenly, that everybody was getting excited about the potential? Does it make life difficult if people’s expectations are a little bit too elevated early on?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I work in the basic science area, so I felt immune from that.
Carol Greider: It’s all the companies that have to worry about that kind of expectations because we never really said as scientists that there was going to be that kind of therapy to come in tomorrow because we didn’t have the vested interest to be doing that.
Elizabeth Blackburn: I think it is good to have these avenues explored for sure and I think that the fact that it hasn’t gone all that fast is actually not to do with the science or other sorts of things. In the meantime it’s really important to try and understand what is going on because any therapeutic is going to be all the better for having a better sense of what underlies the usefulness and where its danger points might be. It’s not clear how we think about these issues of long term diseases that affect huge numbers of people, you don’t necessarily put everybody on statins, that’s a common thing, but perhaps that equivalent isn’t necessarily the best way to go either, although we tend to be a very ‘take a pill’ oriented society and nothing wrong with that, I mean. I am all for western medicine, believe me, but I am just saying that we don’t want to limit our thinking I think to that …
Jack Szostak: And jump into something too quick and not recognize a problem.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Exactly, that’s right.";536;Creativity
I wanted to end just by dealing with these questions of staying with your subject or not. You two have stayed with the subject …;Carol Greider: That’s debatable, the subject really has changed continuously;536;Creativity
I am sorry, the subject expands…;"Carol Greider: Yes, I was a biochemist you know and now I am working on recombination and human disease and various other things.
Elizabeth Blackburn: I work with clinicians on chronic psychological stress, but the point is I am not the expert. I bring my expertise and they bring theirs, so it stays very fresh by keeping one’s expertise that you really have. Now interfacing with other expertise’s so it’s actually a very broad topic. Anything that says our cells are going to be able to keep replenishing got a lot of broad implications even though we are focused on one part of it.";536;Career Devleopment
Maybe I will discover my questions completely redundant, but let’s say you two are at least following the questioning in the same general vein and yes, it’s taking you to new places. You, on the other hand, have seemed to jump from one question to another, but there is almost a clear break between one question and the next and they seem from the outside the two different ways to do science. One is to say, There is a problem, I will work on it for a while and then I will look for another problem, actively go and find a different problem. Would that be fair to say?;Jack Szostak: I think you could find lots of examples of people who you know have one system and they use it to address lots of different questions and that can be extremely productive and then there are other people who just like to find interesting questions in different areas and go for it.;536;Creativity
But what I was going to ask was what for you is the attraction of jumping from question to question.;Jack Szostak: Well its fun to think about new things, get into an area where you don’t really know very much so you don’t have to be fooled by the preconceptions that might dominate the field so you might have a chance of making a contribution in a different way. So that is part of the attraction.;536;Creativity
Is there also an attraction in going to less populated places?;"Jack Szostak: For me, I don’t like to be working in an area where there are a lot of other people who are going to do the same experiment at the same time or a few months later. I find it more fun to be doing something that is probably unique.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And that’s what telomeres were initially to. Nobody was asking these questions and it is a the most fun way to do science actually. I agree with you.
Jack Szostak: In the mid or late 1980s I think the implications of all the telomere work were becoming clear and it was I think clear that a lot of people would be going into that field and so I think that helped to make me look around for other areas and all the stuff about ribozymes was very new and exciting and I was very surprised that there were very few people going into that area so I thought that we might …
Carol Greider: You had already got the Nobel Prize by that time?
Jack Szostak: That was 1989 and we started working on it in actually -85.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And how life begins, I mean that’s a pretty important question.
Jack Szostak: It’s a lot of questions when you start to break it into pieces, it’s a lot of interesting questions, so that has come to dominate what we do today.";536;Research
Your Nobel Prize is of course associated with a couple of interesting numbers. This is the hundredth time, I am sure you’ve heard, that the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded and also this is the first time ever that two women have been co-recipients of the same Nobel Prize in the sciences, and telomere research in general is one where the proportion of women is more normal, if you like, its more representable of the maked up society. Is there a reason for that, do you think?;Elizabeth Blackburn: I think we should turn it around and ask why everybody else is so aberrant, seriously, because I think that actually might frame the question a little bit more instructively as to why things are not, as you said, the biological or societal representation of women. We can point to various sorts of things such as the fact that some of who have been in the field are females, but actually there are plenty of men in the field as well and I think what stands out is that the numbers are a little different, but certainly, having examples of women who have done well in science – we all know that kind of example does make it more encouraging for others, younger people, to visualize themselves being successful in science – and so I think there has been a kind of perpetuating effect there, but I do like to think that this is the normal way it can be and perhaps we should think about, well, how do we make this more normal in other fields of science.;537;Diversity in Science
We will pick up your question, why is it aberrant in other fields do you think?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: Somebody else can take that one.
Jack Szostak: There is obviously a lot of historical reasons, bias, familiar /- – -/ that takes a long time to get rid of and a lot of good role models to get rid of.";537;Motivation
Have you found it difficult being a woman in science?;Carol Greider: No, I have not found it difficult, but I think that one of the things that I have always done is sort of put blinders on and done what I wanted to do, but it was when I then started to get to the higher levels in ranks that I could then look back and see what the data was. At graduate school there were 50% women, at graduate school there was postdoc fellows usually 50% and then as you get higher and higher up the representation is lower. I didn’t feel like I personally had experienced any big obstacles, I am a scientist, I can look at the data and see that there is something that is not quite representative, as one moves up the higher ranks. I think that role models are one good thing, that the more people there are in the higher ranks the more the younger people can look up and say Yes, there is something that I can do, and it doesn’t seem like an impossible task.;537;Advice for female scientists
Is there more that needs to be done than role models? I mean, would it naturally change, or does it have to be aggressively tackled do you think?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I think aggressive tackling is good. Look at something like smoking, it took very aggressive actions to make smoking less of a wide-spread practice and certain amount of imposition of things. I don’t think it will happen organically completely from within. When you talk to colleagues, individually they are very well disposed to the idea that they see the value of having more women and more diverse groups of people’s insights, because like any enterprise the more diverse sorts of backgrounds come into it, the better way the problems can be solved. I think there is not a lack of good will among a lot of people to do this. It is a question of how do you do it, and then I am sure a mixture of various sorts of strategies will be hopeful, not least education and not least just seeing a woman there sort of makes it more possible. I think we are very visual species, and you look at something and that’s evidence in front of you, that you seem to think Oh, that’s me. If you were a young woman, I could do this.
I think further that we have to make the career structure a little bit more flexible because there has been a one size fits all model for careers in science which have been very much that based on a man having a supportive wife or partner or something to take care of life and family and that’s been something that has been daunting, we find, to young women. I personally found it very daunting as a young woman into the career structure, not the science, but the career structure, and so I think we can be much more imaginative about how we make sure women don’t leave sciences during the time when they have preoccupations with family or with elderly parents who need long term care, the sort of things that women often do.";537;Mentors (Role models)
Yes, that requires one to have really quite a strong support structure within science.;"Jack Szostak: A lot more broadly than that, there are a lot of things done here in Sweden that would be kind of chocking in the United States.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, absolutely!
Carol Greider: A support in terms of general /- – -/ support.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, because I think the seeking point for many women, at least in my personal experience from what I see is, they say “I just can’t see being a scientist and I also do want to have a life” and I think that that is something that we shouldn’t say to young people. “Oh no, you can’t have a life and be a scientist” and yet that is the perception that they have. I think as senior scientists we could do a lot more to try to think of active ways in which this one kind of career structure model that we have could be thought of more imaginatively. And I just know examples of women who have gone part-time as their families and other needs have happened, and then they go back in full time and they just come roaring back and have done really well, and they are not all in the United States unfortunately, which again tells us something about the United States situation and support.";537;Environment
I think it’s your own phrase … I have heard you say it. They were known in the 1930s, it was known that they had an important protective role of the chromosomes, but people didn’t know what they were. It was you in the late 1970s that sorted out the molecular nature.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: Began to, its still an on-going saga, none of us are out of jobs yet. That’s right. I think it was so wonderful the science that was done /- – -/ genetically in which such deductions were made about what’s going on with chromosomes and their inheritance. Now we look back at it and we say they didn’t know it was DNA and yet the thinking about what was observed, and I particularly enjoyed McClintock’s work because that’s what I got more familiar with. It was so elegant and there are so many treasures in there, of insights into what turns out to be going on in meiosis and as it turned out with what’s going on with telomeres, although her fame more broadly was, I think, perhaps more for jumping genes for many years. What she said, something written in 1931, about a telomere being distinctive, and she didn’t call it a telomere, was so clear and I think very important and it was just lack of the research tools of the time.
Jack Szostak: Molecular understanding was there …
Elizabeth Blackburn: Right they had microscopes, they had genes, phenotypes, they had really wonderful other kinds of thinking, but they were not playing with the same sort of toys in the lab that we have played with.";537;Creativity
Ahead of time … Then you two met at this Gordon conference in 1980 and it’s sort of the way science is supposed to happen, two people meet each other, have an idea, do an experiment and prove something wonderful.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: And then … nobody pays for it, but they do pay for it, no they pay for a broad sort of setting in which you can go and do experiments and explore and ask questions without somebody saying, Oh, is this going to be useful for this year’s economy or for somebody’s /- – -/ medicine. I think that is really important, I mean we thought that was something … we didn’t really think about it at the time, it was such a given that you can do an experiment with broad funding that is never going to be wasted. Scientists don’t throw away money, they work very hard and giving scientists money to ask questions that hadn’t been planned, it’s really important.
Jack Szostak: That meeting, or that kind of meeting, it’s great for bringing people together, who are working on different things.
Elizabeth Blackburn: These meetings are famous for …
Carol Greider: You had met each other before?
Jack Szostak: No, that’s how we met. After your talk I came up …
Elizabeth Blackburn: We walked across this lawn and just talked and talked.
Jack Szostak: Because I was working on broken DNA molecules’ ends and then Liz had these ends that behaved completely differently, and it was just a contrast that was kind of chocking so we had to talk about it and see what we could do to figure out what was going on.
Carol Greider: So Liz, you gave your talk first?
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes.";537;Creativity
It was after the talk the two of you teamed up?;Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, I talked about what we knew about the molecular nature of these DNA molecules. You know the ends, you could get your hands physically on.;537;Creativity
We will turn to the experiment in a minute, but I just want to ask you in general about choosing companions in science, because it is so important to get the right people to work with. Is there some, and of course one works with lots of different people throughout one’s career, but are there some criteria that you applied choosing companions to work out with?;"Jack Szostak: I think it’s mostly a matter of, you know, is there an interesting experiment that actually can get done?
Elizabeth Blackburn: And then if you have the luxury of choice, yes, you do want to work with people who really do rigorous science, I think, and that can be very different kinds of science, can be done with rigour, but I think that’s important as one collaborates with people outside new areas. Jack and I, we were really much in the same sort of area, it was a molecular genetic tradition, but when you collaborate even further out, now you don’t have the deep expertise, then I think you have to have a real respect for that person’s quality of their research.
Jack Szostak: And you also need to have someone who is fun to talk to and you can exchange ideas with, each way. Some people are better at that than others. More fun to work with.
Elizabeth Blackburn: But you are right, if the scientist is really exciting you will make it happen.
Jack Szostak: You will find a way.";537;Competencies
And when you are picking companions who don’t have a track record, students that come in into the lab, what do you look for in them?;Carol Greider: Really, it’s just the excitement of what they are doing and they simply need to communicate that excitement back and forth and I think if people really are interested and care, just interacting with them over a period of a few weeks, one can tell whether or not there is a compatible set of interest that are there. So usually there is an opportunity to do that when students may be coming into the lab, you have a chance to get to know them a little bit and see where the capabilities are on both sides. It’s not just a mentor choosing a student for a very … there is opportunities for students to go around and choose mentors and make sure that they are compatible with them as well, and I think both of those things are important.;537;Competencies
I was going to go on to ask what do you think are the important characteristics of being a mentor, what do you try and provide for the student?;Carol Greider: Again, it’s all about the science and it’s about being a /- – -/, sit down and have a conversation and really understand that person’s interest. Some problems are very interesting, but somebody may approach it from a particular angle and somebody else approach it from a different angle and then when those two people talk it may not be as easy to understand, but a third angle, there may be a shared understanding like, you know, languages, if somebody speaks a language that is close to a language, if somebody speaks Italian and Spanish, maybe they will understand each other better than somebody speaking some other languages. So I think that that is true in terms of people in their interpersonal interactions as well, so finding those compatibilities is just a matter of spending some time together and talking about their science.;537;Mentors (Role models)
I don’t know if you want to add anything?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: And finding their strengths too, which is something I learned not by being clever, but somebody once said to me that Shirley Tilghman, who is now the President of Princeton, but she is a very accomplished molecular geneticist, and somebody who knew her very well in her science days said she always is very good finding what people are good at and then making sure that gets used very well. It’s not an altruistic thing necessarily, she is making sure they thrive and do the best in science and I thought that was a really good hint and I try and look for that as well because some people have real strengths in some areas, some will ask all these questions all the time and they will never do this experiment, but its also important that they are doing that. Others will say, Yes, I will do the experiment but also be critical. Carol was actually somebody in the latter, she said, “I will do the experiment” and be very smart and critical at the same time. But other people will question, question, question, and if you can make use of that and say, this is really good that someone’s bringing into their really critical thinking and not say, Well, I really want you to do it this way and stopping it, and think, Ah this person actually is smart and they probably got some good reasons for what they are thinking about and so try and use what strengths you feel you discern in people is important.
Jack Szostak: I like to find people who are pretty independent and have some initiative and the best students are the ones where I can tell them that’s never going to work and then they go and do it and show that it does work.
Elizabeth Blackburn: My problem is that I always think that it is going to work, and they are the ones who say, Well actually …. It goes both ways and you have to have both going on and you have to have the sort of Let’s try it, and things that you really have reasoned through very well, that sometimes is the route to doing something new as you reason something very well and you do that and then something new comes of that too, so both ways in biology really can work and you can’t always predict which is going to be the formula.";537;Future research
Presumably it often takes quite a long time to find out what people are good at, because there must be a lot of graduate students who start and then find they don’t hit the ground running, it takes time to get going. That can be quite a dissolution at time, so it’s important for people to understand it can take time for one to work out what one should be doing.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I think people’s quality of thinking that emerges relatively easily I think, now as you say what unfolds in the experiment can of course be very slow because you know by definition you are doing things that are difficult. If they are easy someone would have done them, and so that’s I think the hard, unpredictable road for graduate students. Back to your questions of mentoring, that’s were you have to realize that that’s going on and that people will go through periods in science as we all have done, when you’re just seeming to fail all the time and the experiments don’t work, sometimes for reasons that are boring, but sometimes for reasons that are significant. You have to be able to fail a lot of the time, scientists just have to be terrific at getting slapped back on the face by nature all the time.
Carol Greider: I have told my students and I am famous in the lab for saying “That’s why they call it research” because somebody would come into my office and we will be talking about an experiment with a great result and I say “Great, go and do it again!” Somebody would come into my office and say “Nothing worked at all, nothing worked at all”. “Great, go and try it again!” And I say that’s why it is called re-search, you always have to do it again.
Elizabeth Blackburn: I realized the opposite because somebody said it isn’t research because somebody already searched for the /- – -/ rediscovering it or something. I like yours better.
Carol Greider: You have to repeat that good experiment just like you have to try again at the failed experiment.";537;Advice  for young scientists
Yes, Carol’s is less depressing, yes. So back to the experiment, together you demonstrated that telomeres from one species could protect DNA from an entirely unrelated species and thus the mechanism of the telomere protection was more fundamental than perhaps one might have though initially. And that result was very clear, you understood that immediately so where you aware of what an important piece of information you had just discovered at the time?;"Jack Szostak: I think we knew that it was going to open up a lot of new experiments, because we could use all the tools available in yeast as well as you could do in Tetrahymena and then in other organisms. So we knew that it was going to allow more progress.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And I think it also felt somewhat fundamental in the sense … you know molecular biology was very dominated by there will be universal solutions for things because we were so influenced by the genetic code, DNA, everything was very universal and so when you saw something crossing lines of phylogenetic divisions … Don’t you think there was a bit of a sense when we found the sequences looked similar and they looked like there is something fairly deeply universal in the eucariotic world.
Jack Szostak: That is an important point, because it was already clear that in bacteria and many viruses there were lots of different solutions, so it didn’t have to turn out to be universal.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, it was completely nonintuitive what would go on in terms of actually more the replication problem in terms of … and protection too.";537;Meaning(Values) of Work
And you also observed that the telomeres in yeast were lengthening and that something had to be causing that lengthening and that’s when you come into the story, because you set out to find the activity that was causing the lengthening.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: By chemically speaking yes, because I thought that was … I am sort of a biochemist, somewhat by training I suppose and I had gone through biochemistry and then molecular biology and so it felt natural to try and say this is very direct, you know, reactions take place in real time sort of more or less in front of your eyes in sort of, you know, biochemical way.
Jack Szostak: You had the right organism for doing the right chemistry.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And the organism was right and it turned out … There was a biology of the organism that set this burst of telomere synthesis that takes place and there was an abundance, relatively speaking, of telomeres and so that all pointed to, well, this is a good system to try and answer questions and I had been trained in the lab of Joe Gall, which is where I actually did the sequencing of the telomeric ends, as we now call them, the DNA ends of the mini-chromosomes in the ciliated protozoans. Joe had very much always said that you should find this system in which you would answer the question best, what I think is a fundamental idea. Things will be pretty conserved throughout much of life and so this idea that find the good system was very much in my mind so I started out doing a little out of foray into things, got ten years, felt brave and Carol joined the lab and felt really brave.";537;Meaning(Values) of Work
She was one of your unusual students who took one of your ideas and said, Yes I can do that and off she went.;Elizabeth Blackburn: I had actually offered it to a postdoc who turned it down: Very nice Liz, but I think I will do something different. It was very politely, but.;537;Mentors (Role models)
And you got this now famous Christmas present in 1984, the first indication that you got your hands on the activity that was causing the lengthening of the telomeres.;"Carol Greider: Yes, I was doing experiments, it was about nine months of trying various things. Liz and Jack had proposed that there may be something that would lengthen the telomeres and so, not knowing exactly what that is or what the properties were. We would just try different things and Liz and I would talk to each other every day or so and say, Okay let’s try this, like cooking, you add some ingredients and you taste it and that doesn’t taste so good so you add a little bit more salt. After trying various things there was one particular change that I made in the experiment. I was just interested in … It was an exciting time to do an experiment and then a few days later, it would take several days for the experiment to sit on an autoradiograph and so I went back in on Christmas day to develop the results of the experiment that I had done several days before and that’s when I saw this very clear repeating pattern on the autoradiograph that just looked like a six-base repeating pattern that you would expect of a telomere repeat.
That first instinct is like, Wow, this might really be what we think, of course, then after the excitement there is the, Well, are we being fooled? And so then has to follow all of the ways where we would then be our own worst critics in a sense. It’s like how could we be being fooled by this? Maybe it’s really some normal polymerase that is copying something that is a repetitive sequence in the extract. So that is were the real work of the self criticism is very important and so that is why the discovery was Christmas 1984, but the paper was published in December -85.
Elizabeth Blackburn: It just shows how fast these things go actually.";537;Meaning(Values) of Work
It is an obvious point, but obviously you were enjoying yourself tremendously and going in on Christmas morning was just something that was natural and the enjoyment of what you do is key, is absolutely the essence of it. Its not work, its enjoyable, I presume.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: That’s right, it’s the best kept secret in science. We never tell people what fun we are having and maybe we are a little afraid because somehow society will frown upon the idea that you actually really … And yet at serious play, but it’s completely the element and the resources, I wonder what, because often the trajectory of the experiments, you find out something the next day because something has rather been incubating or autoradiograms exposing, things like this. There is often this thing where you would leave something and the next day come in and I have just been driving to Berkeley and I am driving up university avenue, really impatient because the traffic would get very slow off the free way, and you knew there would be something at the end of that university avenue when you got out of the car and went into the lab.
Carol Greider: That’s why I lived up on the hill and I came down on my bike.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, you came down on your bike fast, that’s right. And you had a Volkswagen once. At least you were on the bike, that’s good. But I think that’s really an important point because many young people are saying, Oh you know science is so hard, its so true, and we all complain bitterly because we just take completely for granted the fact that we are having such a good time so we sort of have the luxury to complain about the other stuff. But it’s a really good career and very autonomous, nobody tells us what to do in terms of our choice of research and when you think about how many jobs that’s true for it’s a mince and its not as if scientists waste money. We really are so driven, we want to find things.
Carol Greider: I remember when I was a graduate student and it was the first time that I was sort of on my own and supporting myself, and I was like, Wow, they are going to pay me to come in and play everyday ,and I was being paid now what would now be you know, but it was great and I thought Wow, this is just amazing. Maybe if I just keep it up, and it’s worked so far.
Elizabeth Blackburn: No, it’s true, as an Assistant Professor you’re suddenly given this playground. They really trust me to do this – that was my feeling. And Berkeley was very /- – -/ actually and they sort of really trust you to go out and … I think now mentorship in young peoples careers is much more thoughtfully done and maybe that’s not always good because we had huge freedom just as Assistant Professors, right?
Jack Szostak: We just had the resources to go.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes, you have to gather the resources, but then you work really hard because you are just driven.";537;Creativity
Perhaps it’s too big a question to ask whether its changing for the good or for the bad. Its presumably going in both directions in the same time.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I think those who love science are still driven in the same way.
Jack Szostak: I don’t know, it might be, it probably takes more time and effort to raise the money to support lab. There are more frustrations there, maybe its more bureaucratic than it use to be, but if you really want to do it, you can still do it and then you have the luxury of doing whatever experiments you think are the most interesting.";537;Motivation
Okay, so back to the enzyme, the enzyme you discovered was unusual, it was a reverse transcriptase with extra protein and RNA and it took some time to sort all that out. When you did sort it out, it turned out that it solved the end replication problem because this problem had been laying around for a while unsolved of how DNA polymerase, well the fact that DNA polymerase could not, on its own, synthesize both chains of DNA to the end. And it seems strange that that problem had been there without anybody being able to solve it for quite a long time. DNA polymerase was revealed in 1958 by Kornberg and it was pointed out in what 1970 or so, 1972 by Watson and others, there was this problem. And it was the late 80s or mid 80s the solution came.;"Carol Greider: There were solutions in other organisms as Jack had alluded to, that various viruses … what wasn’t known was how the eucariotic chromosomes solved the problem and that did wait for the sequences, until Liz found the sequences you couldn’t really ask the question until you had the actual molecular details.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And there was some peculiarities about the sequences, there were different numbers of repeats of the ends of different molecules in a population of molecules. This wasn’t like viruses although there are some viruses in which they do have recombination at the ends and they have some end repeats as well, so there were solutions that looked very plausible, that the viruses of bacteria had already evolved to have. It was really various lines of evidence that sort of said, Aha, this does not seem to be the kind of solution that new eucariots have.
Jack Szostak: But if you go back and read all our early papers we were through a lot of models, they were mostly based on recombination-like mechanisms and we held on to those to the bitter end until the sequences said that can’t possibility be.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Because people could draw beautiful diagrams, right, and the literature was, you did …, I don’t know how to draw beautiful ones. No but there was definitely some ideas out there and some of them have turned out to be quite applicable actually to some viruses and stuff like that, so the ideas were not completely useless.
Carol Greider: … applicable to telomerase in theory, as well.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes!
Jack Szostak: Yes, that’s right.
Carol Greider: There really were two answers, it’s just that one turned out to be a little bit more dominant then the other.
Elizabeth Blackburn: A lot more dominant.
Carol Greider: A lot more dominant, yes!
Elizabeth Blackburn: As almost universal eucariots, with exceptions, and exceptions are always instructive, that is sort of the richness of the question because there is such a lot that goes on in what seems very simple, but technically a different chromosome, it sounds like you just stick a fortress around and that’s okay, but its much more interesting and dynamic than one had thought, which again makes it fascinating.";537;Meaning(Values) of Work
It is fascinating, is it interesting because one tends to tell the story of science in retrospect as being a problem followed by a solution and its not quite that, is it? Its much more complicated.;"Elizabeth Blackburn: And often observations come and then they are what you expect and then you start thinking about them and what they might mean and then realize, Yes, that might be providing a solution to something. You know it doesn’t happen in …
Carol Greider: But there are also possible solutions that aren’t correct, or pursue things, that’s not how they found out, that’s not how it works and you go back and pursue a different angle and what you end up hearing about historically is those things that were correct, so it seems like a linear path when actually it was a branch in a tree of which were interesting ideas. They just didn’t turn out to be how it actually worked.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Yes! Or at least not in that situation.
Carol Greider: Yes, that particular situation.
Jack Szostak: And also you get a solution to say the problem that you were thinking very originally, but once you have that solution you realize, Oh, now there is three other problems you hadn’t even thought of before and so it goes. And that is really true in the case of like human telomeres where the biochemistry is unbelievably complicated.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And yet there is an inevitability to the complexity because people say, Well, if you want a very robust sort of system it has to be inherently complex and so suddenly it makes sense in a way that we didn’t think of. We really simplified the question where we just said, we are just going to think about the DNA and the enzyme that does it and just so, you have to do that, I think, up to a point, you have to take away the irrelevancy, but always knowing that it is taking place in a cell, an incredibly complex entity which is a cell inside an incredibly complex identity which is, in our case a human, and yet you can take these things and sort of push them up to a point and then you have to realize when you have to take the blinders off, that’s the key. But again, the inherent complexity of it, its not like a curse, its sort of like, This is the way it is, because the really interesting reasons why systems have to be that way and yet we have to, on the other hand, sort of reject the complexity at certain stages in the research.";537;Motivation
20 years on you are still working on telomeres and telomerase and sorting out the system and one thing that … Oh yes, I am coming to Jack, I’m coming back to that. One aspect that is growing up is the therapeutic implications of the fact that telomere shortening was seen to be associated with the disease states and indeed the maintenance of telomere length in both directions seems to be important, maintained equilibrium is important. What do you feel are the potential therapeutic benefits of studying telomerase and telomeres?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: It is usually divided into two general categories, one is the rather hyperactive telomerase that characterizes the great majority of human cancers, on the other hand the telomerase that is presents in much more regulated form in the natural cells of the body. The normal cells, the telomerase is present in much more regulated form in normal cells of the body and various indications, such as the associations you mentioned of short telomeres with many disease states or risks of it that’s intriguing this genetic data in cases of insufficient telomerase action which says that clearly is not good for humans to not have enough telomerase in their normal cells that have to replenish to decades of adult life if we are fortune enough to move past our re-productive years and we are looking at old age, we are interested in what our health is like for that. So understanding what’s going on in cells at this fundamental level, I think you really do understand this, just to understand what’s going on in the trajectory of humans as we age, because all of the social and other settings are now letting us age, we have this sort of unexpected biological reality to live with, so we are understanding that first of all.
Now, are there quick-fixers magic pills? Not tomorrow, but maybe there is interesting things that could keep telomerase a little more active, but you have to be careful and I like to think it’s like aspirin, you take two aspirins – good – take a bottle, that’s bad. Clearly any measure would have to be carefully thought through how you would, if you want to keep telomere maintenance better, not to push it too far, because too much telomerase can help cancer cells, but I mean, really a lot to much. Then the question of course is can you exploit the high telomerase in cancer cells to selectively target cancer cells and there is beginning efforts in industry to do very early stages, to look at these kinds of things. But I think just understanding what’s going on is actually really important in understanding human ageing.
Carol Greider: And it’s not just telomerase, because one of the things that we have learned in the research over the years is really that’s the short telomeres that cause the end effect and as Jack has mentioned, any time you ask a question and you find out the answer there is many more other questions to ask. There are various regulatory mechanisms that allow the telomere length to be maintained at a certain equilibrium and telomeres is essential to provide the raw material to do that, but both the telomere is regulated as well as the proteins that are on the telomeres, that the telomeres has to interact with. I think that really understanding those details of all of the components and the complexity that goes in to the regulation will tell us a lot about these diseases, these age related degenerated diseases that may not be just telomerase related but they may be a number of other genes that one can look at that may be associated with these degenerated diseases that aren’t directly the telomerase, so there is a lot of interesting avenues to pursue still, to really understand the different directions these diseases may come from.";537;Meaning(Values) of Work
Because there was a great deal of therapeutic excitement about telomerase and telomeres early on and there still is. Was there an initial kind of pressure on you suddenly, that everybody was getting excited about the potential? Does it make life difficult if people’s expectations are a little bit too elevated early on?;"Elizabeth Blackburn: I work in the basic science area, so I felt immune from that.
Carol Greider: It’s all the companies that have to worry about that kind of expectations because we never really said as scientists that there was going to be that kind of therapy to come in tomorrow because we didn’t have the vested interest to be doing that.
Elizabeth Blackburn: I think it is good to have these avenues explored for sure and I think that the fact that it hasn’t gone all that fast is actually not to do with the science or other sorts of things. In the meantime it’s really important to try and understand what is going on because any therapeutic is going to be all the better for having a better sense of what underlies the usefulness and where its danger points might be. It’s not clear how we think about these issues of long term diseases that affect huge numbers of people, you don’t necessarily put everybody on statins, that’s a common thing, but perhaps that equivalent isn’t necessarily the best way to go either, although we tend to be a very ‘take a pill’ oriented society and nothing wrong with that, I mean. I am all for western medicine, believe me, but I am just saying that we don’t want to limit our thinking I think to that …
Jack Szostak: And jump into something too quick and not recognize a problem.
Elizabeth Blackburn: Exactly, that’s right.";537;Creativity
I wanted to end just by dealing with these questions of staying with your subject or not. You two have stayed with the subject …;Carol Greider: That’s debatable, the subject really has changed continuously;537;Creativity
I am sorry, the subject expands…;"Carol Greider: Yes, I was a biochemist you know and now I am working on recombination and human disease and various other things.
Elizabeth Blackburn: I work with clinicians on chronic psychological stress, but the point is I am not the expert. I bring my expertise and they bring theirs, so it stays very fresh by keeping one’s expertise that you really have. Now interfacing with other expertise’s so it’s actually a very broad topic. Anything that says our cells are going to be able to keep replenishing got a lot of broad implications even though we are focused on one part of it.";537;Career Devleopment
Maybe I will discover my questions completely redundant, but let’s say you two are at least following the questioning in the same general vein and yes, it’s taking you to new places. You, on the other hand, have seemed to jump from one question to another, but there is almost a clear break between one question and the next and they seem from the outside the two different ways to do science. One is to say, There is a problem, I will work on it for a while and then I will look for another problem, actively go and find a different problem. Would that be fair to say?;Jack Szostak: I think you could find lots of examples of people who you know have one system and they use it to address lots of different questions and that can be extremely productive and then there are other people who just like to find interesting questions in different areas and go for it.;537;Creativity
But what I was going to ask was what for you is the attraction of jumping from question to question.;Jack Szostak: Well its fun to think about new things, get into an area where you don’t really know very much so you don’t have to be fooled by the preconceptions that might dominate the field so you might have a chance of making a contribution in a different way. So that is part of the attraction.;537;Creativity
Is there also an attraction in going to less populated places?;"Jack Szostak: For me, I don’t like to be working in an area where there are a lot of other people who are going to do the same experiment at the same time or a few months later. I find it more fun to be doing something that is probably unique.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And that’s what telomeres were initially to. Nobody was asking these questions and it is a the most fun way to do science actually. I agree with you.
Jack Szostak: In the mid or late 1980s I think the implications of all the telomere work were becoming clear and it was I think clear that a lot of people would be going into that field and so I think that helped to make me look around for other areas and all the stuff about ribozymes was very new and exciting and I was very surprised that there were very few people going into that area so I thought that we might …
Carol Greider: You had already got the Nobel Prize by that time?
Jack Szostak: That was 1989 and we started working on it in actually -85.
Elizabeth Blackburn: And how life begins, I mean that’s a pretty important question.
Jack Szostak: It’s a lot of questions when you start to break it into pieces, it’s a lot of interesting questions, so that has come to dominate what we do today.";537;Research
The work for which the prize has been awarded was done a good quarter of a century ago, and so I imagine you’ve all allowed yourselves the luxury of imagining yourself here once or twice, so is it a huge surprise to find yourselves here?;Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: For me yes, yes it is, I never thought before, to be here one day. Surely because working on the HIV/AIDS I thought that probably you will need a vaccine to have a Nobel Prize one day for this disease.;538;Impact of the Nobel on you
Again, something we’ll come to in a little while. This year’s prize has been awarded for work on two viruses, human papilloma virus, HPV, and human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, and the work on these two viruses indicates two very different timelines of research for discovery. in HPVs case it took you, Professor zur Hausen, a full decade to convince the community that your hunch that HPV was responsible for most cervical cancers was correct. How did it feel to have a hunch that you had to keep for ten years while working on it?;Harald zur Hausen: Let me say it this way, it’s true what you said, I mean it took about ten years or so before we were able also to prove our point, but in a way there’s some, in my opinion, there’s some similarity between AIDS and cervical cancer research said this way. It’s of course a problem of enormous magnitude, particularly in the ECS right now, killing an enormous number of people. Cervical cancer has been a problem of enormous magnitude over decades, a million year really, because it’s probably with us since the early time of mankind. In a way these are both conditions which are quite important, the agents causing them are quite different, I mean they are really different, and so research followed different pathways in a way, but I think looking at it from the viewpoint of public health these are both problems of certain importance.;538;Creativity
Certainly, yes, that unites the discoveries. But just getting back to this timeline thing, were there times during your ten-year search for the proof that you thought of abandoning the project?;Harald zur Hausen: No, not really, because I must say I was very convinced that we were on the right track from the beginning really, because first of all we had seen that the existing number of anecdotal reports are from malignant conversion of genital warts, and secondly already since the 1930s there are examples available where at least in animal systems papilloma virus has caused cancer. So it was not that farfetched to research carefully in human cancers as well, and cervical cancer was a good example. It was not well received in the early days it’s true, because another virus had been suspected at that time, namely inner genital herpes simplex type II infections, but I must say really we were convinced during this period that this was the right way to go and so we pursued it intensively.;538;Creativity
It became, as many people have reported, quite a competitive area later on, but at that point, when the epidemic was just beginning, was it a very collaborative field to be in? Were people helping each other?;Luc Montagnier: Yes, I think it was actually, we had a very good relationship with Dr Gallo and his colleagues at the NIH in the United States, and we had access to his reagent to show this virus was different from HTLV-I for the first human T-cell leukaemia virus found in men. And also we had as Françoise said, a good contact with clinicians who we are working now on AIDS, there were very few in France because in that time maybe there were other cases of AIDS, but not in France. We had also the collaboration of a very good electron microscopist, could see the first viral particle one month after we had the culture, and after that we extended our collaboration with immunologists and epidemiologists so that we could have a group which could concur to find this virus as /- – -/ because it was the main … of course /- – -/ virus is good, but was it passenger virus, was it something else, where did it go, this is where the main problem, and in that of course, and my /- – -/ colleagues also quickly contributed.;538;Creativity
What have we learnt so far from those patients?;Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: We already learn the patients that are called HIV controllers is less than 2% of people that are infected, they control perfectly well their viral load, and we already learned that at least some of these controllers have developed a sub-population of T cells which are capable to eliminate infected cells. We know that this sub-population of T cells is less activated that the cells that we found in most HIV patients that progress to disease. What we don’t know yet is why this proportion of patients are developing this response, what are the signals that in use this sub-population of efficient CD8 cells, we know that there is some genetic factors that are probably associated, genetic factor does not explain all of it because not all HIV controllers are HLAB 27, B57, and to speak into English, into scientific language, but whatever, that means that genetic factors are probably involved.;538;Environment
Right. Thank you. A question for any and all of you, do you think that viruses will come to play a more important role in cancer in the future? Do you think that we don’t yet fully understand how important viruses are in causing cancer?;"Luc Montagnier: I think the candidates retroviruses is also for breast cancer, prostate cancer, it’s possible, and probably also we have to look at infectious bacteria, the microbes, not only the viruses, because cancer to be some factors, you know, to be termed not the only factor, but since cancer is multifactorial probably there are some infectious agents probably like the stomach cancer where you’ve got Helicobacter pylori also.
Also a Nobel Prize …
Luc Montagnier: … two years ago, so I think yes, we should look for more infectious agents in cancer, it’s a way also to protect because we have needs to counteract the effect on viruses, vaccine but also antiviral drugs so there are many possibilities to find viruses and micro variations as well by antibiotics for instance.
Harald zur Hausen: I agree with what Luc Montagnier said a moment ago. Indeed, in my opinion too there are good chances that additional cancers will be linked to viruses in the future. If you look into the discovery of new viruses potentially linked to human cancer it becomes apparent that during the past two years four new types in the papilloma virus group popped up, one by the way here in Sweden. One of them is also linked to a specific type of human cancer, namely the so-called Merkel cell tumours, a relatively rare tumour arising on the immune suppression in the skin and your endocrine tumour. I personally believe that besides breast cancer I also strongly feel that there’s very good reason to search very intensively for viral etiology, leukemias, lymphomas, really cancers where you have very good reasons to search for agents, so right now from epidemiological grounds.
I also feel, which relates to what Professor Montagnier said a moment ago, to look more carefully in cancers where we know already since a long time that genetic modifications play a major role, because there’s no infections linked to cancer at this moment without additional genetic modifications in the host cell, that’s an interplay between the infections and modifications of the host cell genome. For those reasons I personally also suspect that cancer of the colon is interesting and looking for it for quite a number of variety, in fact I will allude to this in my Nobel Lecture a little bit, and I think it’s still an open question to which extent that it affects a link to human cancer. If you look at it globally and if you include the old /- – -/ cancers right now identified besides Helicobacter pylori in gastric cancer also 10% of gastric cancers are linked to /- – -/ bowel infections you come up to a figure of about 20-21% of the global cancer incidents. I personally believe that this is not the end of the story, and that we are still in for further surprises.
Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: I totally share with what has been said and we have already a lot of viruses that are related to cancer and we will discover more in the future. I just would like maybe one point that we have to consider with the virus HIV, under treatment. For example there is more and more complications that we could see in HIV patients including cancer, and I personally believe that we have to understand better what’s’ going on, why when a patient restores an immunity that he develops cancer, and probably we will discover also several agents that are responsible for cancer.
Harald zur Hausen: I mean to add one point, if you identify infectious agents of human cancer then of course as Professor Montagnier said before, we have not only a better possibility in prevention but also for therapy because in many of these cancers we can identify exactly the molecules that are responsible for the malignant growths. In cervical cancer for instance, if you switch off the two viral genes which are active the cells revert to a quasi-normal state, and so these are, you identify targets and you can much better cope with those types of diseases in the end if you try to develop a targeted chemotherapy in those cases.";538;Creativity
You mentioned the search for infective agents, is there a sufficiently good apparatus in place do you think to search for the agents?;"Harald zur Hausen: In my opinion it’s an underdeveloped area in the research on the whole, I mean globally, because there are a couple of laboratories working on these questions, but on the whole the interest decreased rapidly in the 1970s, between 1970s and 80s, with the discovery of onco-genes and tumour suppressor genes, because at that time quite a number of scientists believed there was no need any more for infectious agents. You could explain cancer quite readily by a failing interplay between oncogenes and chemo suppressive genes, but that story turns out to be not as simple as it was thought during this period, and many of the former virologists turned into cell biologists during this period. I think it’s a gradually now an awakening interest again in these questions and I hope it will go on in the future.
Luc Montagnier: Yes, we have a much better technology now to identify new agents than we had in the 80s, much more powerful.
Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: We will probably learn from the genomics I think, the new technology will be very helpful to discover new agents responsible for disease.
Luc Montagnier: We don’t intercultivate viruses anymore, it’s /- – -/ in the case, because we can cultivate the papilloma viruses in vitro but all the /- – -/ techniques you can …
Harald zur Hausen: Without molecular biology we wouldn’t have been able to identify the HIVs /- – -/ than without techniques.";538;Advice  for young scientists
So as some last thoughts, what advice would you offer to young people who want to come into the area and search for causative agents for these diseases?;"Luc Montagnier: The very first to say there are still plenty of things to find, new /- – -/ objects, which already exist, we don’t know. Actually probably some people say we know only 10% of the virus world, and so there are many other viruses to come, new epidemics perhaps but also plenty of work to do, and probably quicker, in a much quicker than we did in the past. I think it’s a very interesting field, and also for helping humankind because cancer is the main cause of death and disease and it’s a very terrible disease and we have to find all the agents including viruses and microbes.
Harald zur Hausen: If you ask me, I will say develop original and slightly unorthodox ideas, avoid to believe too much in dogmas, and be persistent, and either prove or disprove your own hypothesis.
Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: I totally agree, about dogma, and be very persistent, but also don’t be afraid to work in multi-disciplinary approaches, this is a road for success indeed.";538;Advice for young scientists

Were people helping each other?;Luc Montagnier: Yes, I think it was actually, we had a very good relationship with Dr Gallo and his colleagues at the NIH in the United States, and we had access to his reagent to show this virus was different from HTLV-I for the first human T-cell leukaemia virus found in men. And also we had as Françoise said, a good contact with clinicians who we are working now on AIDS, there were very few in France because in that time maybe there were other cases of AIDS, but not in France. We had also the collaboration of a very good electron microscopist, could see the first viral particle one month after we had the culture, and after that we extended our collaboration with immunologists and epidemiologists so that we could have a group which could concur to find this virus as /- – -/ because it was the main … of course /- – -/ virus is good, but was it passenger virus, was it something else, where did it go, this is where the main problem, and in that of course, and my /- – -/ colleagues also quickly contributed.;539;Creativity
What have we learnt so far from those patients?;Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: We already learn the patients that are called HIV controllers is less than 2% of people that are infected, they control perfectly well their viral load, and we already learned that at least some of these controllers have developed a sub-population of T cells which are capable to eliminate infected cells. We know that this sub-population of T cells is less activated that the cells that we found in most HIV patients that progress to disease. What we don’t know yet is why this proportion of patients are developing this response, what are the signals that in use this sub-population of efficient CD8 cells, we know that there is some genetic factors that are probably associated, genetic factor does not explain all of it because not all HIV controllers are HLAB 27, B57, and to speak into English, into scientific language, but whatever, that means that genetic factors are probably involved.;539;Environment
Right. Thank you. A question for any and all of you, do you think that viruses will come to play a more important role in cancer in the future? Do you think that we don’t yet fully understand how important viruses are in causing cancer?;"Luc Montagnier: I think the candidates retroviruses is also for breast cancer, prostate cancer, it’s possible, and probably also we have to look at infectious bacteria, the microbes, not only the viruses, because cancer to be some factors, you know, to be termed not the only factor, but since cancer is multifactorial probably there are some infectious agents probably like the stomach cancer where you’ve got Helicobacter pylori also.
Also a Nobel Prize …
Luc Montagnier: … two years ago, so I think yes, we should look for more infectious agents in cancer, it’s a way also to protect because we have needs to counteract the effect on viruses, vaccine but also antiviral drugs so there are many possibilities to find viruses and micro variations as well by antibiotics for instance.
Harald zur Hausen: I agree with what Luc Montagnier said a moment ago. Indeed, in my opinion too there are good chances that additional cancers will be linked to viruses in the future. If you look into the discovery of new viruses potentially linked to human cancer it becomes apparent that during the past two years four new types in the papilloma virus group popped up, one by the way here in Sweden. One of them is also linked to a specific type of human cancer, namely the so-called Merkel cell tumours, a relatively rare tumour arising on the immune suppression in the skin and your endocrine tumour. I personally believe that besides breast cancer I also strongly feel that there’s very good reason to search very intensively for viral etiology, leukemias, lymphomas, really cancers where you have very good reasons to search for agents, so right now from epidemiological grounds.
I also feel, which relates to what Professor Montagnier said a moment ago, to look more carefully in cancers where we know already since a long time that genetic modifications play a major role, because there’s no infections linked to cancer at this moment without additional genetic modifications in the host cell, that’s an interplay between the infections and modifications of the host cell genome. For those reasons I personally also suspect that cancer of the colon is interesting and looking for it for quite a number of variety, in fact I will allude to this in my Nobel Lecture a little bit, and I think it’s still an open question to which extent that it affects a link to human cancer. If you look at it globally and if you include the old /- – -/ cancers right now identified besides Helicobacter pylori in gastric cancer also 10% of gastric cancers are linked to /- – -/ bowel infections you come up to a figure of about 20-21% of the global cancer incidents. I personally believe that this is not the end of the story, and that we are still in for further surprises.
Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: I totally share with what has been said and we have already a lot of viruses that are related to cancer and we will discover more in the future. I just would like maybe one point that we have to consider with the virus HIV, under treatment. For example there is more and more complications that we could see in HIV patients including cancer, and I personally believe that we have to understand better what’s’ going on, why when a patient restores an immunity that he develops cancer, and probably we will discover also several agents that are responsible for cancer.
Harald zur Hausen: I mean to add one point, if you identify infectious agents of human cancer then of course as Professor Montagnier said before, we have not only a better possibility in prevention but also for therapy because in many of these cancers we can identify exactly the molecules that are responsible for the malignant growths. In cervical cancer for instance, if you switch off the two viral genes which are active the cells revert to a quasi-normal state, and so these are, you identify targets and you can much better cope with those types of diseases in the end if you try to develop a targeted chemotherapy in those cases.";539;Creativity
You mentioned the search for infective agents, is there a sufficiently good apparatus in place do you think to search for the agents?;"Harald zur Hausen: In my opinion it’s an underdeveloped area in the research on the whole, I mean globally, because there are a couple of laboratories working on these questions, but on the whole the interest decreased rapidly in the 1970s, between 1970s and 80s, with the discovery of onco-genes and tumour suppressor genes, because at that time quite a number of scientists believed there was no need any more for infectious agents. You could explain cancer quite readily by a failing interplay between oncogenes and chemo suppressive genes, but that story turns out to be not as simple as it was thought during this period, and many of the former virologists turned into cell biologists during this period. I think it’s a gradually now an awakening interest again in these questions and I hope it will go on in the future.
Luc Montagnier: Yes, we have a much better technology now to identify new agents than we had in the 80s, much more powerful.
Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: We will probably learn from the genomics I think, the new technology will be very helpful to discover new agents responsible for disease.
Luc Montagnier: We don’t intercultivate viruses anymore, it’s /- – -/ in the case, because we can cultivate the papilloma viruses in vitro but all the /- – -/ techniques you can …
Harald zur Hausen: Without molecular biology we wouldn’t have been able to identify the HIVs /- – -/ than without techniques.";539;Advice  for young scientists
So as some last thoughts, what advice would you offer to young people who want to come into the area and search for causative agents for these diseases?;"Luc Montagnier: The very first to say there are still plenty of things to find, new /- – -/ objects, which already exist, we don’t know. Actually probably some people say we know only 10% of the virus world, and so there are many other viruses to come, new epidemics perhaps but also plenty of work to do, and probably quicker, in a much quicker than we did in the past. I think it’s a very interesting field, and also for helping humankind because cancer is the main cause of death and disease and it’s a very terrible disease and we have to find all the agents including viruses and microbes.
Harald zur Hausen: If you ask me, I will say develop original and slightly unorthodox ideas, avoid to believe too much in dogmas, and be persistent, and either prove or disprove your own hypothesis.
Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: I totally agree, about dogma, and be very persistent, but also don’t be afraid to work in multi-disciplinary approaches, this is a road for success indeed.";539;Advice for young scientists
The work for which the prize has been awarded was done a good quarter of a century ago, and so I imagine you’ve all allowed yourselves the luxury of imagining yourself here once or twice, so is it a huge surprise to find yourselves here?;Françoise Barré-Sinoussi: For me yes, yes it is, I never thought before, to be here one day. Surely because working on the HIV/AIDS I thought that probably you will need a vaccine to have a Nobel Prize one day for this disease.;540;Impact of the Nobel on you
Again, something we’ll come to in a little while. This year’s prize has been awarded for work on two viruses, human papilloma virus, HPV, and human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, and the work on these two viruses indicates two very different timelines of research for discovery. in HPVs case it took you, Professor zur Hausen, a full decade to convince the community that your hunch that HPV was responsible for most cervical cancers was correct. How did it feel to have a hunch that you had to keep for ten years while working on it?;Harald zur Hausen: Let me say it this way, it’s true what you said, I mean it took about ten years or so before we were able also to prove our point, but in a way there’s some, in my opinion, there’s some similarity between AIDS and cervical cancer research said this way. It’s of course a problem of enormous magnitude, particularly in the ECS right now, killing an enormous number of people. Cervical cancer has been a problem of enormous magnitude over decades, a million year really, because it’s probably with us since the early time of mankind. In a way these are both conditions which are quite important, the agents causing them are quite different, I mean they are really different, and so research followed different pathways in a way, but I think looking at it from the viewpoint of public health these are both problems of certain importance.;540;Creativity
Certainly, yes, that unites the discoveries. But just getting back to this timeline thing, were there times during your ten-year search for the proof that you thought of abandoning the project?;Harald zur Hausen: No, not really, because I must say I was very convinced that we were on the right track from the beginning really, because first of all we had seen that the existing number of anecdotal reports are from malignant conversion of genital warts, and secondly already since the 1930s there are examples available where at least in animal systems papilloma virus has caused cancer. So it was not that farfetched to research carefully in human cancers as well, and cervical cancer was a good example. It was not well received in the early days it’s true, because another virus had been suspected at that time, namely inner genital herpes simplex type II infections, but I must say really we were convinced during this period that this was the right way to go and so we pursued it intensively.;540;Creativity

Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, welcome to Stockholm. When we spoke a couple of months ago, just after you’d heard the news that you’d been awarded the Nobel Prize, you both sounded quite surprised that it had come as quickly as it has done. Has that surprise subsided at all?;"Andrew Z. Fire: I’m still surprised by the whole thing. It’s obviously a really major honour to be honoured by one’s colleagues in such a way but at the same time, there are a lot of other scientific discoveries and other contributions to the field we’re in that are probably no less deserving and so it’s an interesting situation to be in.
Craig Mello: I agree, every day I’m still not sure it’s really me that’s the recipient of this recognition. I really feel it’s more the prize is awarded for the science and in that respect we’re representing many researchers and it’s a great honour to be here to be spokespeople for the discovery and to bring some attention to the science and the fun of science.";544;Impact of the Nobel on you
How have the last couple of months been, have they been whirlwinds?;"Craig Mello: Very much so.
Andrew Z. Fire: Yes, we each have our scientific day to day lives and intertwined with that has been a lot of interesting other things and also planning a trip to Sweden, so the combination of things has made for a busy couple of months for both of us, I think.";544;Research
Craig Mello: Certainly not, because we still don’t understand how it works. I think it’s been very exciting and fun to be part of this field because of all of the interesting interrelationships between the RNA interference phenomenology and then the developmental mechanisms that are related to it. I think we have so much still to learn about the basic mechanism of gene regulation, even going beyond RNAi as playing a role in that process, but honestly I feel that it’s been exciting at many steps along the way, but I can’t think of a single point where we felt we understood the mechanism really. I still feel we don’t understand the mechanism fully, we have a much better idea about the underlying mechanism now but we have so much more to learn that it’s just still a lot of fun, it’s a very exciting field.;"Andrew Z. Fire: That’s certainly a major part of it. The other major part of it was that the groundwork that had already been laid in the puzzle, primarily by other people. A major part of it was the people that worked with us that all had put very significant contributions to it. It was really a matter of being in the right place at the right time, particularly the work that had been done in plant systems and in fungal systems and some of the work that was done elsewhere in the worm system by /- – -/ and other people really set it up so that we could just inject RNA that we would make in the lab and then get a result in a couple of days or a day. That happened and that made a very sort of efficient system to begin to test hypotheses.
Craig Mello: I think the understanding that there was an organismal response to the injected material was part of what was very exciting to me, even though I didn’t understand certainly what was happening. The observation that the silencing signal could spread from cell to cell and even be transmitted in the germ line were extremely exciting and yet we didn’t understand how the silencing was triggered. In fact, we were not focused on double stranded RNA, in my case we were thinking more in terms of double stranded RNA potentially as a replication intermediate or something that was produced during the amplification process that was necessary for the inheritance to occur. We thought more of double stranded RNA therefore as an intermediate in the silencing and Andy really deserves credit for thinking perhaps the double stranded RNA is an important trigger as well because in some organisms like ourselves, there’s clearly a double stranded RNA response that had been studied previously that’s involved in anti-viral mechanism.
We were thinking more of it as an intermediate, which it really is as well, it’s interesting, double stranded RNA is a trigger but it’s not the only trigger for this type of silencing. I think that also was an element that added to the confusion in the literature on the earlier work done in plants, because it wasn’t clear when a virus or a transgene was introduced into an organism, what the trigger was. I think the reason some of that confusion exists is because there are more than one trigger for this. It’s an interesting twist really that we still don’t understand all the different ways that you can trigger the silencing but double stranded RNA is in fact an intermediate in many of these related silencing pathways, so that’s one of the elements we still are very much in need of understanding.";544;Meaning(Values) of Work
You emphasised the basic science aspect of all this and that there’s a lot still to be understood. I suppose the world has really embraced RNAi as a technology and an application. Do you find that worrying that people leap on it in its partially understood form and want to use it?;"Craig Mello: I don’t find it a worry, I think it’s natural for people to want to use, especially when you have a sick family member, this sincere desire for some sort of a treatment or cure and I think it’s important for the scientist to make sure that that doesn’t get blown out of proportion, that that hope doesn’t get overstated. I can totally understand the excitement. I think that if anything, we really need to focus on, it really is an exciting discovery and there are many applications that it can be put to and I think we need to get that message out. I don’t think there’s anything to fear except perhaps going too far and being too hyperbolic in promoting it, but I do think we need to get the message out because it’s very important as a research tool, certainly and potentially as a therapeutic, so I think it’s important.
Andrew Z. Fire: It’s almost a humorous thing, but one of the things I found is that when I’ve gone to lecture in classical genetics which is many of the tools of which were pre-existed us by several decades and 100 years or whatever. One of the things I find is the students will suggest, why not do everything by RNAi? There’s still very much room for classical genetics, it’s really the basis for a lot of what we do and what we think about and other techniques of genetics that also have come up in the last few years. Targeted gene disruption, which is extremely valuable technology and useful and a number of other things. I think that students realise that when they get into the depths of research problems, that they really have to understand not only what’s been developed in the last few years but also things that were developed 100 years ago.";544;Role of Science
Do you think the funding climate is as accepting of basic research as it used to be?;"Craig Mello: I think that the funding climate is tight now, in part because of the tremendous wealth of information that we have about the human genome for example, the sequence of every gene. With that as background and the information technology that we have for searching that database I think it’s harder to get funding to do the kind of work that Andy and I did and quite often it’s a priority that has to be made whether to fund this or to fund that and both really should merit funding, but there just isn’t enough money. In a way I think we’re being strapped in part through the success of the scientific enterprise as a whole, creating more good science that can be done and I think that really can be looked at as an opportunity in the message that we have to get out to the people who make policy in terms of the politics and the funding decisions, that there is a great opportunity with the advances that have been made in medical research.
The genome sequence and the information technology that gene profiling technology for looking at the expression of genes in cells and things like RNA interference that allow you to shut off genes to study their function. These provide opportunities that make it actually harder to get basic science funding because now you can do a lot of these experiments in human cells and that’s not always good. The fact is, if you’re taking away the money from the very basic science, that could lead to new technologies, new discoveries that would be very hard to get in a vertebrate cell system. I think, as in the pre-review process, we’ve seen this, I know that I have, where you have to make a decision and there are just, several grants that should be funded and they’re just not going to make it, no matter what, because there are all these others that need to be funded. These priorities just becomes an impossible situation and to fix that we just need to get the message to the public to support science more, so that we can continue to get the funding we need.";544;Environment
Does your funding come mainly from basic research funding, from NIH or is there also an industrial component to what you do?;"Andrew Z. Fire: Our funding comes from non-profit sources, both completely are. My lab is funded completely by NIH and …
Craig Mello: I have funding also from the NIH and Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The work that was done really was funded privately, some private grants other than those mentioned as well, so philanthropic support for disease-oriented grants like the ACS, the March of Dimes funded some of my research and also the Pew Charitable Trust, so to mention I think all of them.
Andrew Z. Fire: Those are all charitable organisations and they’re public organisations but they’re all toward the goal of improving healthcare in a general way.";544;Environment
When you bring new people to work on the problem into the lab, I was interested to know what you look for in those students coming in?;"Andrew Z. Fire: I learnt a lesson from a mentor of mine, a gentleman named Donald Brown. If someone walked up to the door and said, I want to learn, that was a major feature, even if the person might not come in with the most spectacular of previous mentorship or whatever, that was a really major thing. I think that’s something that one looks for, someone that really wants to learn.
Craig Mello: It’s very hard I think, sometimes students who are very bright are not motivated enough. I think the major ingredient is motivation and a desire to follow through with an experiment. Those are qualities frankly that you cannot glean in an interview, so I think some of the best scientists have struggled sometimes getting into the lab because the interview process might weed them out, or they may not have the patience for it, in order to go through it. But I find, once you work with someone you really get to know what they’re like, so most laboratories have what we call a rotation process, so students will get an opportunity to work with you in the laboratory as they decide on which group they want to join during graduate work. I think that’s been for me the most important aspect, is having time to spend with the student in the laboratory, find out what they’re like.
I suppose that recommendation must become a very important part, if you’re looking for somebody’s long-term commitment to problems, you need to know that they’ve done that before.
Craig Mello: It can be but they’re so unreliable.
Andrew Z. Fire: Right, it’s hard because the recommendation letters often say as much about the person writing the letter, so you have to factor two different components into the equation. It’s sometimes too difficult to parse out which is which.
Craig Mello: Many letters from Asian laboratory heads are incredibly brief and it’s hard to read into the line what they really mean. I think it’s a stylistic choice that they make not to overstate anything and then sometimes in the US you get these letters that go on and on and on and you don’t know how much is genuine either, so I think there’s no perfect way, I really feel that it’s hard to tell in advance.";544;Competencies
You mentioned mentorship and obviously you’ve both been the recipients of great mentorship. What’s that taught you about your own practice of mentoring?;Craig Mello: I feel so fortunate to have had great mentors along the way and still colleagues that I’ve learnt so much from. It’s very, very important but I could spend hours talking about mentors but …;544;Mentors (Role models)
Could you summarise just a couple of the things perhaps that you try and practice as a mentor for your students?;"Andrew Z. Fire: It’s a hard question.
Craig Mello: Do you want to take a crack at that?
Andrew Z. Fire: I think that one tries to listen to what people are thinking because first of all that’s part of the mentorship process and second of all it’s part of the scientific process. No matter who it is, even somebody who’s just walked into the lab – we’ve had high school students working in the lab. The other thing is that you try and work with people as colleagues for each other and get them to ask each other questions because again, I don’t necessarily provide the best mentorship for people in the lab, the best advice and getting advice from each other has always been really critical and that’s one of the nice things about running a research lab in some cases. You can’t just sit back and let the ship run, but on the other hand there are a lot of cases where the really important, critical suggestions come because one person on one project suggests something to another person working on another project. It’s a really important aspect of it, to keep a collegial environment where people are comfortable talking to each other and suggesting things to each other. I’ve just been very fortunate in having had people in the lab who are both outstanding scientists and also outstanding mentors to each other and to me as well, in a lot of cases.
Craig Mello: Yes, I think it’s so important, the conversation that you have in the laboratory with your students or with your adviser as I can recall in my own past. Those are so important as a way of learning and as a way of coming up with ideas. It’s interesting because the two people walk into the room and the idea is not there, it’s not always brought there by one individual. Usually the idea materialises in the room or in the discussion group and the one thing that I really fear is coming in with my own idea that’s wrong and pushing it too hard. When you’re mentoring, it’s important not to be too forceful about pushing your idea and to try to let people know that they should voice their ideas. Sometimes that for me has been the most difficult part, is getting the people in the lab to say what their ideas are. A lot of times their idea’s wrong and my idea’s wrong and the other person’s idea’s wrong, but you put them all together and all of a sudden there’s a new idea.
Andrew Z. Fire: That might also be wrong, but it’s still a lot of fun.
Craig Mello: At least maybe there’s an experiment you can do that will distinguish. That’s the fun, that is really a fun part of the process and one thing I fear and I’ve heard that once you have this kind of a prize, that your students are too respectful and they won’t question. You say something and they’ll actually believe it.
Andrew Z. Fire: That’s scary.
Craig Mello: Science is all about questioning things and if you don’t question it …
Andrew Z. Fire: Doubt it.
Craig Mello: … doubt it, yes. I think we need to reinforce that message to our students after we come back from this brief period of celebration. We need to go back and make sure that we get right back to the questioning.";544;Advice  for young scientists
That neatly brings me onto the question of your youth, you’re both very young and this is going to bring considerably greater notoriety. How do you think it’s going to affect your future research paths and that question of distance from your students is certainly one aspect?;"Craig Mello: I hope not too much in that respect. I feel that it’s like having a new job, an additional job, in addition to running the lab and trying to be a good adviser and leader for your group, to have this new responsibility to be a spokesperson for the science and to try to do the right thing in terms of promoting and the understanding of the science which … We just had a very interesting discussion in parliament in that I actually felt a little bit guilty during the discussion because scientists really haven’t done a very good job of educating the public about science and that’s partly because it’s nobody’s job. They don’t really make that your job, somehow it’s supposed to be part of your job but that’s not the part that you get paid for, you get paid for doing the research and publishing the papers, which are read by your peers not by your neighbours. I think it’s an important responsibility I feel, but I hope it doesn’t distract too much from the science. I’m very excited all the time by what’s going on in the lab, want to get back to it.
Andrew Z. Fire: I really like my day-to-day life of teaching and research and family and that’s a pretty full life for both of us and so adding, as Craig says, an extra job to that, I’m not quite sure how it’s going to work but somehow we’ll probably manage.";544;Advice for young scientists
When you talk about educating people about science, is there a particular target group you think of, is there one group of people who you think need this more than any other?;"Craig Mello: No, I think it’s a lifelong process to be educating yourself constantly because science is a fluid thing and it’s not just science, it’s all realms of knowledge really. There’re all kinds of interesting things to learn in this world and I think we need to make our children into lifelong learners somehow, don’t lose them along the way, to the interesting world that you can expose them to and it’s very difficult. There’s no easy solution, I think, to this question of how best to educate and that’s what we also were talking about earlier today. I’d be interested to know how the Swedish people have solved that problem. It’s interesting to learn about different cultures and how they approach learning, but it’s very important.
Andrew Z. Fire: Yes indeed.";544;Creativity
What turned you on to being a lifelong learner? What was it that happened to you that made you? Was there a single event that made you want to learn?;"Andrew Z. Fire: I hate to say it was a single event because it’s a lifelong thing. I think one thing, in terms of lifelong learning is that it’s surprising how little you need to change a description of a piece of science between talking to the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institutet, which is one of the highest audiences in science and people that are extremely knowledgeable about everything you’re talking about, down to kindergarteners. If you just change some of the language, you can use almost the same discussion for both groups and have a significant fraction of them, probably, at least come away with some understanding of what you talked about, probably the same fraction in each case.
Craig Mello: I think science as a process though, it naturally tends to make you want to be a lifelong learner. If you’re going to enter into an enterprise where there really are no right answers, that’s what science is all about, it’s testing ideas, it’s trying to disprove an idea. Once you have an idea, the first thing you do is try to test it to see if it’s right and the most fun thing is when it’s wrong and then you have to come up with a new idea, so it’s a constant process. If you ever thought that you would understand everything, certainly that would be very boring to be part of a science that is now a complete understanding of a process. Fortunately, I don’t think that’s going to be our problem for many, many, many years to come, so I think it’s a natural process once you’ve decided that you would like to be involved in science.
The nice thing is, every day it’s an exploration, it’s a new discovery out there waiting to be made and just the process itself I think lends itself very well to the basic human nature of liking to explore and to understand and to see new things. That’s what science is all about, so I think we can do a lot better in terms of recruiting people into the sciences if we could somehow project that at an earlier level in education. Right now I think too much of our education is focussed on memorising facts and not enough on the exploratory process of science. What a real scientist does is so different from what you’re exposed to when you take science in high school or grade school. I feel that for me and my own understanding of what it would be like to be a scientist, I was fortunate to have a father who was a palaeontologist, so I was aware of science going on at this Smithsonian where he worked, the museum where he worked and going on field trips with him. Getting to see that real scientists don’t just read books, they actually do things, is so important.";544;Mentors (Role models)
I’m interested in this idea of being able to explain the work to any audience. I think Ernest Rutherford said that you shouldn’t be doing science if you couldn’t explain it to your tobacconist, which is a kind of antiquated concept nowadays perhaps, especially in the US. Your field doesn’t lend itself immediately to simple explanations, there’s a lot of jargon associated with it, so the fact that you feel that you can, with few alterations, explain it simply is a very encouraging message.;"Andrew Z. Fire: I think it takes a little bit of time. One of the things that’s challenging is to explain things in a very short time. You need to be able to go back through some of what’s been learned, often with a group that’s not as aware of the history and go through that. I think with that it becomes more straightforward. What I think is a challenge and it’s often impossible is just when people say, can you tell us in a few words. The one that struck me in the few days after the announcement of the award was thinking about the scientists or the mathematicians who solved the Poincaré conjecture, which is a very important conjecture in mathematics and thinking about someone walking up to them and say, Well, in a few words can you explain to the general audience both the conjecture and the proof of it? Of course that certainly is doable in a little bit of time but it’s difficult in a short period and when I thought about that, I was a little bit more relaxed about my somewhat ineptitude in one occasion when I’m asked to explain things in a few words, at being able to do that totally clearly to everybody, it can be a challenge.
Craig Mello: I think one of the real interesting things about talking to people about your work is, you’re right there’s a lot of jargon and a lot of times that’s just very distracting but I find that sometimes children even ask the better questions because they just don’t know what a word means for example and they say, Well, what is DNA? or What is RNA? What is a protein? You could then spend hours and hours discussing what it is and as long as the child or the adult continues to ask questions, you’ll find this wonderful conversation that can go on for quite a while. I agree with Andy, it just takes time and it takes the audience also being curious enough and not afraid of asking a question. I think most scientists are happy to spend some time discussing their work and quite often they wonder why no-one asks a question. They didn’t understand something very early in the talk and so they stopped listening and it’s important to raise your hand and say, But can you explain this one thing and quite often that’s a really good question. The hard part is losing people, and it’s a two-way thing. Conversations with a child can sometimes be even easier because you know how to track the conversation to keep them engaged.";544;Creativity
Terrifying, because they reveal the fact that one can’t explain it oneself but yes. One of the things we did this year for the first time was to invite some of the public to ask questions to you via the Internet and I’d like to, if I may, just pose a couple of those questions. First, a rather specific one from Kerry Austin in Texas who says, What application in genetics will offer the most effect use of RNA interference?;"Andrew Z. Fire: I think there are probably lots. In the field of genetics there are probably many different applications, again combined with the tools of both classical data genetics and the sort of more modern set of technologies that don’t necessarily involve RNA gene disruption. I think altogether they give us a really good toolbox. Not something that in 20 years we’re going to say, You’re doing that? You know these were the crude tools we had in 2006 to do experiments and I think that they’ll also improve over time, so I’m not sure they’ll be one best application in research genetics, I think there’ll be many applications but they’ll be combined with all the other tools and we’ll always be wanting better tools.
Craig Mello: Yes, certainly it is speeding, I think the use of vertebrate cells as genetic tools for studying the function of genes and there’s some really exciting technologies that have been developed that allow it to be applied fairly broadly in studying genes in cells in culture. I think that that’s helping a lot, but by itself it’s just the first step, so I think it’s being used primarily as an inexpensive but fairly rapid way of doing genetics and really needs to be backed up ultimately with other kinds of genetic tools such as real knockout cells and perhaps even animals to test these ideas before you really understand what’s happening. You have multiple lines of data or investigation that support your work, but RNA interference is an important tool I think for doing that first round of genetics where there are 20,000 genes and you want to know which ones are important in tumour or in some other disease. You have to sort through a lot and it’s a quick way of doing that, maybe a new way that would have been impossible earlier, so I think it’s providing an important function there.";544;Meaning(Values) of Work
There was a time when people were talking a lot about the need for standards for such experiments. Is that time passed, are they now widely accepted for the publication of RNA interference?;Andrew Z. Fire: I think there’s still a need for standards. There are publications that have a very high standard for proving something and those cases you really are quite sure that what they’re reporting is indeed due to a decrease in a specific gene. There are some cases where, because of the system, in a few cases where it’s quite difficult to do the kinds of controls you want to do and for other reasons too, you come away not being as sure of the results. You’re certainly sure that the observations are correct, but whether the results are indeed due to a specific gene. I think there’s an interesting give and take amongst people writing and doing work in the field.;544;Meaning(Values) of Work
Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, welcome to Stockholm. When we spoke a couple of months ago, just after you’d heard the news that you’d been awarded the Nobel Prize, you both sounded quite surprised that it had come as quickly as it has done. Has that surprise subsided at all?;"Andrew Z. Fire: I’m still surprised by the whole thing. It’s obviously a really major honour to be honoured by one’s colleagues in such a way but at the same time, there are a lot of other scientific discoveries and other contributions to the field we’re in that are probably no less deserving and so it’s an interesting situation to be in.
Craig Mello: I agree, every day I’m still not sure it’s really me that’s the recipient of this recognition. I really feel it’s more the prize is awarded for the science and in that respect we’re representing many researchers and it’s a great honour to be here to be spokespeople for the discovery and to bring some attention to the science and the fun of science.";545;Impact of the Nobel on you
How have the last couple of months been, have they been whirlwinds?;"Craig Mello: Very much so.
Andrew Z. Fire: Yes, we each have our scientific day to day lives and intertwined with that has been a lot of interesting other things and also planning a trip to Sweden, so the combination of things has made for a busy couple of months for both of us, I think.";545;Research
Craig Mello: Certainly not, because we still don’t understand how it works. I think it’s been very exciting and fun to be part of this field because of all of the interesting interrelationships between the RNA interference phenomenology and then the developmental mechanisms that are related to it. I think we have so much still to learn about the basic mechanism of gene regulation, even going beyond RNAi as playing a role in that process, but honestly I feel that it’s been exciting at many steps along the way, but I can’t think of a single point where we felt we understood the mechanism really. I still feel we don’t understand the mechanism fully, we have a much better idea about the underlying mechanism now but we have so much more to learn that it’s just still a lot of fun, it’s a very exciting field.;"Andrew Z. Fire: That’s certainly a major part of it. The other major part of it was that the groundwork that had already been laid in the puzzle, primarily by other people. A major part of it was the people that worked with us that all had put very significant contributions to it. It was really a matter of being in the right place at the right time, particularly the work that had been done in plant systems and in fungal systems and some of the work that was done elsewhere in the worm system by /- – -/ and other people really set it up so that we could just inject RNA that we would make in the lab and then get a result in a couple of days or a day. That happened and that made a very sort of efficient system to begin to test hypotheses.
Craig Mello: I think the understanding that there was an organismal response to the injected material was part of what was very exciting to me, even though I didn’t understand certainly what was happening. The observation that the silencing signal could spread from cell to cell and even be transmitted in the germ line were extremely exciting and yet we didn’t understand how the silencing was triggered. In fact, we were not focused on double stranded RNA, in my case we were thinking more in terms of double stranded RNA potentially as a replication intermediate or something that was produced during the amplification process that was necessary for the inheritance to occur. We thought more of double stranded RNA therefore as an intermediate in the silencing and Andy really deserves credit for thinking perhaps the double stranded RNA is an important trigger as well because in some organisms like ourselves, there’s clearly a double stranded RNA response that had been studied previously that’s involved in anti-viral mechanism.
We were thinking more of it as an intermediate, which it really is as well, it’s interesting, double stranded RNA is a trigger but it’s not the only trigger for this type of silencing. I think that also was an element that added to the confusion in the literature on the earlier work done in plants, because it wasn’t clear when a virus or a transgene was introduced into an organism, what the trigger was. I think the reason some of that confusion exists is because there are more than one trigger for this. It’s an interesting twist really that we still don’t understand all the different ways that you can trigger the silencing but double stranded RNA is in fact an intermediate in many of these related silencing pathways, so that’s one of the elements we still are very much in need of understanding.";545;Meaning(Values) of Work
You emphasised the basic science aspect of all this and that there’s a lot still to be understood. I suppose the world has really embraced RNAi as a technology and an application. Do you find that worrying that people leap on it in its partially understood form and want to use it?;"Craig Mello: I don’t find it a worry, I think it’s natural for people to want to use, especially when you have a sick family member, this sincere desire for some sort of a treatment or cure and I think it’s important for the scientist to make sure that that doesn’t get blown out of proportion, that that hope doesn’t get overstated. I can totally understand the excitement. I think that if anything, we really need to focus on, it really is an exciting discovery and there are many applications that it can be put to and I think we need to get that message out. I don’t think there’s anything to fear except perhaps going too far and being too hyperbolic in promoting it, but I do think we need to get the message out because it’s very important as a research tool, certainly and potentially as a therapeutic, so I think it’s important.
Andrew Z. Fire: It’s almost a humorous thing, but one of the things I found is that when I’ve gone to lecture in classical genetics which is many of the tools of which were pre-existed us by several decades and 100 years or whatever. One of the things I find is the students will suggest, why not do everything by RNAi? There’s still very much room for classical genetics, it’s really the basis for a lot of what we do and what we think about and other techniques of genetics that also have come up in the last few years. Targeted gene disruption, which is extremely valuable technology and useful and a number of other things. I think that students realise that when they get into the depths of research problems, that they really have to understand not only what’s been developed in the last few years but also things that were developed 100 years ago.";545;Role of Science
Do you think the funding climate is as accepting of basic research as it used to be?;"Craig Mello: I think that the funding climate is tight now, in part because of the tremendous wealth of information that we have about the human genome for example, the sequence of every gene. With that as background and the information technology that we have for searching that database I think it’s harder to get funding to do the kind of work that Andy and I did and quite often it’s a priority that has to be made whether to fund this or to fund that and both really should merit funding, but there just isn’t enough money. In a way I think we’re being strapped in part through the success of the scientific enterprise as a whole, creating more good science that can be done and I think that really can be looked at as an opportunity in the message that we have to get out to the people who make policy in terms of the politics and the funding decisions, that there is a great opportunity with the advances that have been made in medical research.
The genome sequence and the information technology that gene profiling technology for looking at the expression of genes in cells and things like RNA interference that allow you to shut off genes to study their function. These provide opportunities that make it actually harder to get basic science funding because now you can do a lot of these experiments in human cells and that’s not always good. The fact is, if you’re taking away the money from the very basic science, that could lead to new technologies, new discoveries that would be very hard to get in a vertebrate cell system. I think, as in the pre-review process, we’ve seen this, I know that I have, where you have to make a decision and there are just, several grants that should be funded and they’re just not going to make it, no matter what, because there are all these others that need to be funded. These priorities just becomes an impossible situation and to fix that we just need to get the message to the public to support science more, so that we can continue to get the funding we need.";545;Environment
Does your funding come mainly from basic research funding, from NIH or is there also an industrial component to what you do?;"Andrew Z. Fire: Our funding comes from non-profit sources, both completely are. My lab is funded completely by NIH and …
Craig Mello: I have funding also from the NIH and Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The work that was done really was funded privately, some private grants other than those mentioned as well, so philanthropic support for disease-oriented grants like the ACS, the March of Dimes funded some of my research and also the Pew Charitable Trust, so to mention I think all of them.
Andrew Z. Fire: Those are all charitable organisations and they’re public organisations but they’re all toward the goal of improving healthcare in a general way.";545;Environment
When you bring new people to work on the problem into the lab, I was interested to know what you look for in those students coming in?;"Andrew Z. Fire: I learnt a lesson from a mentor of mine, a gentleman named Donald Brown. If someone walked up to the door and said, I want to learn, that was a major feature, even if the person might not come in with the most spectacular of previous mentorship or whatever, that was a really major thing. I think that’s something that one looks for, someone that really wants to learn.
Craig Mello: It’s very hard I think, sometimes students who are very bright are not motivated enough. I think the major ingredient is motivation and a desire to follow through with an experiment. Those are qualities frankly that you cannot glean in an interview, so I think some of the best scientists have struggled sometimes getting into the lab because the interview process might weed them out, or they may not have the patience for it, in order to go through it. But I find, once you work with someone you really get to know what they’re like, so most laboratories have what we call a rotation process, so students will get an opportunity to work with you in the laboratory as they decide on which group they want to join during graduate work. I think that’s been for me the most important aspect, is having time to spend with the student in the laboratory, find out what they’re like.
I suppose that recommendation must become a very important part, if you’re looking for somebody’s long-term commitment to problems, you need to know that they’ve done that before.
Craig Mello: It can be but they’re so unreliable.
Andrew Z. Fire: Right, it’s hard because the recommendation letters often say as much about the person writing the letter, so you have to factor two different components into the equation. It’s sometimes too difficult to parse out which is which.
Craig Mello: Many letters from Asian laboratory heads are incredibly brief and it’s hard to read into the line what they really mean. I think it’s a stylistic choice that they make not to overstate anything and then sometimes in the US you get these letters that go on and on and on and you don’t know how much is genuine either, so I think there’s no perfect way, I really feel that it’s hard to tell in advance.";545;Competencies
You mentioned mentorship and obviously you’ve both been the recipients of great mentorship. What’s that taught you about your own practice of mentoring?;Craig Mello: I feel so fortunate to have had great mentors along the way and still colleagues that I’ve learnt so much from. It’s very, very important but I could spend hours talking about mentors but …;545;Mentors (Role models)
Could you summarise just a couple of the things perhaps that you try and practice as a mentor for your students?;"Andrew Z. Fire: It’s a hard question.
Craig Mello: Do you want to take a crack at that?
Andrew Z. Fire: I think that one tries to listen to what people are thinking because first of all that’s part of the mentorship process and second of all it’s part of the scientific process. No matter who it is, even somebody who’s just walked into the lab – we’ve had high school students working in the lab. The other thing is that you try and work with people as colleagues for each other and get them to ask each other questions because again, I don’t necessarily provide the best mentorship for people in the lab, the best advice and getting advice from each other has always been really critical and that’s one of the nice things about running a research lab in some cases. You can’t just sit back and let the ship run, but on the other hand there are a lot of cases where the really important, critical suggestions come because one person on one project suggests something to another person working on another project. It’s a really important aspect of it, to keep a collegial environment where people are comfortable talking to each other and suggesting things to each other. I’ve just been very fortunate in having had people in the lab who are both outstanding scientists and also outstanding mentors to each other and to me as well, in a lot of cases.
Craig Mello: Yes, I think it’s so important, the conversation that you have in the laboratory with your students or with your adviser as I can recall in my own past. Those are so important as a way of learning and as a way of coming up with ideas. It’s interesting because the two people walk into the room and the idea is not there, it’s not always brought there by one individual. Usually the idea materialises in the room or in the discussion group and the one thing that I really fear is coming in with my own idea that’s wrong and pushing it too hard. When you’re mentoring, it’s important not to be too forceful about pushing your idea and to try to let people know that they should voice their ideas. Sometimes that for me has been the most difficult part, is getting the people in the lab to say what their ideas are. A lot of times their idea’s wrong and my idea’s wrong and the other person’s idea’s wrong, but you put them all together and all of a sudden there’s a new idea.
Andrew Z. Fire: That might also be wrong, but it’s still a lot of fun.
Craig Mello: At least maybe there’s an experiment you can do that will distinguish. That’s the fun, that is really a fun part of the process and one thing I fear and I’ve heard that once you have this kind of a prize, that your students are too respectful and they won’t question. You say something and they’ll actually believe it.

They didn’t understand something very early in the talk and so they stopped listening and it’s important to raise your hand and say, But can you explain this one thing and quite often that’s a really good question. The hard part is losing people, and it’s a two-way thing. Conversations with a child can sometimes be even easier because you know how to track the conversation to keep them engaged.";545;Creativity
Terrifying, because they reveal the fact that one can’t explain it oneself but yes. One of the things we did this year for the first time was to invite some of the public to ask questions to you via the Internet and I’d like to, if I may, just pose a couple of those questions. First, a rather specific one from Kerry Austin in Texas who says, What application in genetics will offer the most effect use of RNA interference?;"Andrew Z. Fire: I think there are probably lots. In the field of genetics there are probably many different applications, again combined with the tools of both classical data genetics and the sort of more modern set of technologies that don’t necessarily involve RNA gene disruption. I think altogether they give us a really good toolbox. Not something that in 20 years we’re going to say, You’re doing that? You know these were the crude tools we had in 2006 to do experiments and I think that they’ll also improve over time, so I’m not sure they’ll be one best application in research genetics, I think there’ll be many applications but they’ll be combined with all the other tools and we’ll always be wanting better tools.
Craig Mello: Yes, certainly it is speeding, I think the use of vertebrate cells as genetic tools for studying the function of genes and there’s some really exciting technologies that have been developed that allow it to be applied fairly broadly in studying genes in cells in culture. I think that that’s helping a lot, but by itself it’s just the first step, so I think it’s being used primarily as an inexpensive but fairly rapid way of doing genetics and really needs to be backed up ultimately with other kinds of genetic tools such as real knockout cells and perhaps even animals to test these ideas before you really understand what’s happening. You have multiple lines of data or investigation that support your work, but RNA interference is an important tool I think for doing that first round of genetics where there are 20,000 genes and you want to know which ones are important in tumour or in some other disease. You have to sort through a lot and it’s a quick way of doing that, maybe a new way that would have been impossible earlier, so I think it’s providing an important function there.";545;Meaning(Values) of Work
There was a time when people were talking a lot about the need for standards for such experiments. Is that time passed, are they now widely accepted for the publication of RNA interference?;Andrew Z. Fire: I think there’s still a need for standards. There are publications that have a very high standard for proving something and those cases you really are quite sure that what they’re reporting is indeed due to a decrease in a specific gene. There are some cases where, because of the system, in a few cases where it’s quite difficult to do the kinds of controls you want to do and for other reasons too, you come away not being as sure of the results. You’re certainly sure that the observations are correct, but whether the results are indeed due to a specific gene. I think there’s an interesting give and take amongst people writing and doing work in the field.;545;Meaning(Values) of Work
Welcome to meet the Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine 2004, Richard Axel and Linda Buck. First of course like everyone else, congratulations to the prize. You have heard this millions of times in the past days I suppose. This is the afternoon, the day after the big event, so what about the big event yesterday, what are the most memorable moments of the day, Linda?;"Linda Buck: The whole thing was very dramatic and unusual, and it was wonderful to have my family and friends there. It was a once in a lifetime experience.
Richard Axel?
Richard Axel: I thought that the whole day, the ceremony, the formalism of the ceremony and the grandeur of the evening added a spectacular dimension to what we do, and what we do is try and understand how the world works, how the brain works and to have our work, which we do on a daily basis, celebrated in so grand a fashion, really added a very nice dimension.";548;Impact of Nobel on you
One of the things that really strikes you when you read about your science is the huge proportion of one genome that is used for constructing the nose or the olfactory system. Linda Buck, how come, why do we use so much of our genome for the nose?;Linda Buck: I think the way evolution works is that if something happens and if it’s useful then it remains in the genome. I think that during evolution of the sense of smell, multiple genes were made, it was advantageous, and they were capped, and you see that some of the genes are disappearing, there are remnants of genes encoding candidate pheromone receptors in humans and those genes are for the most part intact in mice and most of them have become pseudo genes in humans. Now in addition to that though it does seem that in certain invertebrate organisms there are also very large gene families that are used for smell and so it does seem to be a strategy that has worked, perhaps been developed independently in different organisms …;548;Meaning(Values) of Work
But happened to be exactly the same systems, in …;Linda Buck: Yes, but the genes are not really related, they’re genes that encode proteins of the same type but are really quite different. So it does seem to be a strategy that’s perhaps been developed independently several times.;548;Creativity
Was the sensory organ maybe the first … When you look upon evolution, the way to perceive, to react to the external world, chemotaxis came long before phototaxium and maybe phonotaxis if there is any phonotaxium in the biological world. Is that the right, that the smell, the senses of smell was the first one?;Richard Axel: Chemosensation as you say certainly is the first one. I mean back, every organism, even the most primitive and humble bacterium have to have a way to respond to sense what is in the world around them because that determines how they are going to survive, it determines what their food supply is, how they have to metabolise their food, it determines aversive environments. So all organisms have to have a way to sense the chemical environment and the way they sense the chemical environment has evolved and so we indeed sense it in a different way than does a bacterium but the principle of communicating and responding to the environment is very primitive.;548;Creativity
Anyhow, how is this perception of the chemical environment, how is it mediated into action, how can it be translated to action? What mechanisms is life using?;Linda Buck: I think in mammals and also in many invertebrate organisms the information travels through a series of relay stations, if you will, in the nervous system and that allows the information from hundreds or a thousand different receptors to be organised in progressively more sophisticated ways and also in different ways. In the mammalian cortex what we see is that there are distinct anatomical areas in the olfactory cortex that are getting information from the odorant receptor family in the nose and those different areas of the olfactory cortex send information to different areas of the brain. We think what maybe happening is that the information from the receptors is being organised, combined, or perhaps modulated in different ways in those different areas before being sent on to yet other brain areas. This parallel processing of information is something that is seen in other parts of the nervous system as well so you can take the same sensory information from the external world and then you can process it in different ways in different parts of the brain to use that information for different things.;548;Research
And how do the animals or we perceive all this process? Is it through emotions?;Linda Buck: The information is targeted to different parts of the brain and some of those structures in the olfactory cortex send information on to higher cortical areas, both directly and indirectly through the thalamus, but in addition there are some parts of the olfactory cortex that send information to the hypothalamus and certain parts of the amygdala and those are parts of the brain that control physiological effects, emotional responses and instinctive behaviours. In fact, we think that using the sense of smell, and using molecular approaches, we can gain access to neurons and neural circuits in those very primitive parts of the brain and perhaps begin to obtain information about the neurons and the neural circuits that control instinctive behaviours and emotions.;548;Creativity
Does that mean that the olfactory system is also sending signals to the brain that we are not aware of, through unconscious levels of our brain? What do you think Richard Axel?;"Richard Axel: That’s a hard question to answer; I mean how do we know that there is the unconscious recognition of scent? We do know, as Linda pointed out, that smell is recognised by cells that project to different areas in the cortex and some of those areas, some of those areas are new brain, cognitive brain and others are old brain, emotive brain. One might think that the odours that activate emotive brain might illicit emotions and innate behavioural responses and neural endocrinal responses without the conscious awareness of those signals. For instance, in animals we know that certain odours can reorganise the time of puberty, can reorganise the menstrual cycle and can illicit or prevent mating. There are studies in humans which are far more difficult to control to suggest that there are olfactory driven changes in the menstrual cycle, there’s a very famous study out of Chicago suggesting that women in a dormitory tend to synchronise their cycles and that’s thought to be olfactory, but those studies are psychophysical not biophysical and they’re much more difficult to prove with certainty.";548;Creativity
What about more everyday life events, is it possible that fear can smell and happiness can smell? That we can register emotions in the room without being really aware of it? Is that a too spectacular question?;Linda Buck: People talk about it, I think more in literature than in science, the smell of fear and so on and I don’t know, I think maybe that has to do with components of human sweat or it’s not really, it’s not something that we investigate really and I suppose …;548;Creativity
Because in one of your Nobel lectures or Nobel symposia, you talk about your great interest in trying to elucidate how subordination maybe mediated through smells and also aggressiveness and …;"Linda Buck: We are actually looking, using mice, we’re using odours that have particular effects on the animals, we’re just starting to do that now. We’re looking at activation in the brain by a fox odour that causes a stereotype fear response. We’re also looking at effects of different kinds of odorants on the behaviour of the animal and looking at parts of the brain that are activated and we do see that mice don’t like skunk odour any better than we do and there are quite dramatic behavioural differences between their responses to skunk, skunk, fox odour and vanilla so they’ll actually try to get to an input tube that’s, through which there’s vanilla odour and they try to hide from the skunk. They try to hide from the skunk and in response to the fox odour; they just become paralysed with fear.";548;Meaning(Values) of Work
Do we know that useful things tend to be preserved throughout the biological fear and maybe …;Linda Buck: That’s right and it’s clear that in the hypothalamus … The hypothalamus is basically the major control centre of the brain, it’s very primitive, it’s there in animals, it’s there in human and it’s highly conserved in its structure and also in the genes are expressed there and in the neural circuits and most, if not all, instinctive behaviours and emotional responses are controlled by the hypothalamus.;548;Future research
And the hypothalamus has a direct contact with the nose?;"Linda Buck: There are inputs from, yes; there are inputs from the nose. The hypothalamus actually collects information from all sensory systems, from the other parts of the brain and from the body. It gets input not only from the nervous system, that of course connects the entire body but also through the bloodstream. It measures the temperature, it measures the composition of the blood, it measures sex hormone levels, it controls the menstrual cycle, it controls the stress response. So it’s basically the main control system and of course because odours can cause stress, fear, pheromones and maybe some odours can control sexual behaviour, we can use the olfactory system to try to gain information about those circuits and start dissecting the neural circuits and the individual neurons including the genes that they express, that control those very basic emotional responses and behaviours. That’s where we’re going next.";548;Future research
Another fascinating information that comes from your science is how the olfactory system is translating scattered molecules of sense into an organised map in the brain, it turns into a physical map, Richard Axel, but who is watching the map inside your brain? How do you make sense out of a physical map from these molecules?;Richard Axel: That’s a central issue that neuroscientists would like to address and have been attempting to investigate for a very long time as you’ve heard me put it before. This is a central issue in all senses that is the way… There seems to be a conceptual thread that runs through the different senses and that is that in olfaction as well as in vision the image, whether it be a chemical in olfaction or a visual image in sight, is very complex and it needs to be deconstructed into its components before it can be re-established in the brain as something meaningful. So in vision for example, the individual components of a visual image, that is colour, movement, edges, form texture even at the level of the retina in the eye are deconstructed and carried to the brain by parallel pathways. They are relayed in different regions of the brain so there are regions of the brain that are responsive to movement and not colour, other regions responsive to edge and not movement and at some point, there must be an area which consists of ensembles of neurons that can put this information back together. Now the analogy to the olfactory system as a consequence of the efforts of a number of people including Linda, suggest that you transform chemical space into brain space in the very same way that a given odour, even a single molecular species in an odour, will have the capability of fitting into multiple different receptors and those receptors project to different points in the brain so that those points, the receptors that an odour can interact with and the points which they activate in the brain, form a signature and then as you point out, you’re left with the problem.;548;Meaning(Values) of Work
Who is watching?;"Richard Axel: The problem of who looks down on these points? Who listens to the music, who sees the activation? As I’ve put it before, it’s an old problem, it’s the problem of the ghost and the machine and philosophers have been addressing this problem now since Plato.
Linda Buck: I think this is a challenge for neuroscience in the future and it’s been recognised for a very long time that we do not know how it is that neurons firing in different parts of the brain, active in different parts of the brain, somehow constitute a perception, a percept because it’s clear that not all the information is going to come together in a grandmother cell and when that cell is activated you think “grandmother”. There are indeed neurons that are activated through, in many different parts of the brain and somehow that constitutes a cohesive perception.";548;Free time
But do you really think …;Linda Buck: And there’s nobody looking, it’s the way it works. There’s no one who will be looking, it’s the way the brain works, and I think that it is a scientific problem in terms of how physically that might happen but it’s also a philosophical problem, a conceptual problem because I think it’s difficult for scientists to conceptualise how it is that neurons that are dispersed in different parts of the brain could form a percept and it could be that it’s just going to take some kind of a conceptual or philosophical step for people to say, That’s not a problem, we accept that.;548;Creativity

Today it’s the afternoon, the day after the big day, it’s almost a little cruel to ask you to come here to answer a lot of questions but what are your feelings today after this big event?;I’m beginning to believe it’s real. It’s a very overwhelming experience, the whole week, which is almost over, but my wife and I were discussing just last night that there is a sense of unreality almost, because of course not our usual working day or week and you never know exactly what it is going to be like.;550;Creativity
What will be the strongest memories you will bring back home from these days?;The first thing that comes to mind is some of the guests I arranged to come here, some people I’d not seen in many cases for many years who were very important in my early work and making it possible and encouraging me and collaborating with me. In general I was happy to see them all and happy that they all enjoyed one another’s company as well.;550;Life
One of the strongest memories I will remember is the way you described how your science emerged and the sort of struggle between the chemist and physicist in the early days.;Oh yes. Of course I’m happy that the Nobel organization has been relaxed about the official designation of laureates in various categories, which it was not always I understand from history, 50–100 years ago, there were sometimes serious debates about whether someone is a proper scientist of a certain kind but so far as I could tell from the selection of laureates in recent years the Nobel people really do understand in their hearts how unified the various disciplines are.;550;Creativity
It has passed some time since the first ideas come up and the first experiments were done so there is the possibility to put this into perspective. What would you say is the greatest significance of the possibility of using magnetic resonance imaging?;The first reaction at least was always scepticism, including the reactions of Nobel Laureates. However, unlike some other people the second reaction, sometimes within minutes, was I was mistaken. Now that shows a quality of mind that was able to live with the fact that you have made a public error in a major matter and to apologise for it immediately. Not everyone has the self-confidence and largess of spirit to make it possible for them to do that. Some of the most vigorous objections were some people who quickly became the most intelligent about it.;550;Future research
But it was a very big shift in paradigm going from radiology to magnetic phenomena?;The shift of paradigm was that there was no previous example of applying the kind of techniques to making images that I was proposing and, as is the case with any good idea, one of the first responses of many people was oh of course, why not, those who were not totally sceptical but that again is a well-known phenomenon that the better the idea is the more simple and intuitive it seems to be to some people which makes them think it’s trivial. However, if it really is trivial why did not some of the best people in the world who are doing the work think of it in the previous 20 years?;550;Meaning(Values) of Work
And why didn’t they?;Because they were thinking about physics in a too limited way. As I used to say, it was good to be working with undergraduates in my laboratory because they had not yet learned too much to believe in what we were doing.;550;Creativity
Ignorance might sometimes be a help.;People who are intentionally educated but have not risen beyond their education have a tendency to mistake practical approximations in using calculations for fundamental principles. That is one of the things that you try to bring to students in a proper education and it doesn’t always work but it’s a difficult trick of mind to have worked hundreds of homework problems with a professor telling you you’re making mistakes about something and then to have someone propose something that says all of this work that you’ve been doing is simply a practical approximation to a calculation trick and you’re supposed to think beyond that, which is not always easy. That’s why there’s a long apprenticeship in science and most people continue even after years relying upon what is called in English, I don’t know about Swedish, a rule of thumb, approximations that simple calculations and problems to make them easier to do but that is not the real science, that is just a helpful trick.;550;Advice for young scientists
The history of science is very often connected to new instruments and hands shift in paradigm or quite a new way of looking on the world. I mean Galileo and the telescope and Leeuwenhoek and the microscope. So what about the MRI and Lauterbur?;Not quite the same. There are many ways of doing science but I had been working with the basics of nuclear magnetic resonance essentially all of my professional life and doing chemical structure and analytical measurements using nuclear magnetic resonance with no reference whatsoever to imaging because if anyone thought about it they didn’t even think it was impossible, it did not occur to them whether there was anything there to think about.;550;Meaning(Values) of Work
But in what way do you think that the possibility of looking into the body and looking into the brain, will it in a way change the way we look upon ourselves and the life we live or give us new explanations?;"What forced me to think about the problem seriously was that I saw that such a non-invasive method would be very useful, but I had never heard of any way of solving that problem, not a hint. The actual idea formulated itself in a way that does have some generality, that is by looking at a problem metaphorically instead of right side up, upside down. I was in the middle
of a sentence, which one of my guests here, who was there at the time, reminded me of. I was describing how it was impossible to do any such thing because of certain problems with the physics of the measurements. Halfway through that sentence I realised that those problems were in fact the solution to the fundamental problem. At that point, right in the middle of a sentence was a paradigm shift and of course it took more than just one instant to work out a lot of the practical details but there was a moment where essentially was seeing a problem has actually been its own solution.";550;Creativity
Which is chemistry. Have you started to formulate some new hypothesis about how life originated on earth?;"Yes, but it’s very early. It’s something I’ve been officially working on only for about two years or so and so it’s premature to talk about.
You couldn’t give us a hint?
Paul Lauterbur: It’s very technical also. It involves a part of chemistry that people have known about for some years but no-one has thought was any significance and so there’s a paradigm shift there too but really I’d rather not talk about it because we’re trying to do some of the necessary experiments in my laboratory right now. I don’t know if at this exact moment, but I hope my students are working hard back home but if there’s one thing that you learn, you know, a lifetime in science, even though an idea seems very good to you, the personification of nature, mother nature, can say, Naughty boy, you have not been listening to me, you are totally wrong and you always have to go back to what nature is able to do.";550;Motivation
But let’s, for a short while go back then to magnetic imaging. What is your prospect for the future? I mean how far can imaging be done? Or can you always find some new phenomena that could be used for imaging?;There are many kinds of results that are being found in a preliminary way, which I’m not actively involved with at the moment. I don’t have even a normal understanding of where some of these very new things will go since I have not been following them for two years or so. I don’t know where they will be going in the immediate future. I know there were things that I was working on a few years ago, as well as other people were, that seemed to me to have a great deal of potential, some of which I don’t really have any idea whether they are just clever tricks or whether they have real fundamental potential. I will have to wait, like everyone else, to find that out.;550;Future research
I would very much like to know of course what will be the strongest memories you will be bringing back home from this event.;I think the last day or two, especially meeting the King and Queen, the actual prize award ceremony, the banquet – it’s all been fabulous and most enjoyable, but very tiring. I just don’t know how the Royalty can keep this up either.;551;Environment
One of my strongest memories will be from your Nobel Lecture on Monday when you described how this terrible sound that is produced by the magnetic resonance imaging camera could be reduced, nearly go extinct.;Yes, it’s something that we’re really working on still, it isn’t a complete working system at the moment, it was just an example such as we have at the moment that shows what is possible in principal.;551;Creativity
But your delight when you showed this to the audience, and you also came back to it in your thanks speech at the dinner. Is it very important for you, this?;It’s important to make it quieter because one of the problems of course is that the machines are very noisy. I personally find the noise disturbing at those very very loud levels, so I think anything that one can do which can reduce the noise level and make the safety and comfort of the patient better improve that. I think it is extremely valuable in terms of the usage of the machine. For example, somebody who is extremely sick does not want to be upset or concerned or cowarded by huge levels of noise and if one can make it more pleasant, then so much the better. But there is a serious side to this as well and that is that the noise level is actually at a point where it is dangerous.;551;Advice for young researchers
But is the driving force here your curiosity about the phenomena behind the science behind it, the phenomena behind it, or is the welfare of the patient?;It started out with the welfare of the patient in the first instance. These machines are very noisy and as one goes to much higher magnetic field strengths, the noise gets louder so there is a serious point to this. It happens also to be of interest to me from the physics point of view, how one can go about reducing the noise level in a way which satisfies the requirements of the patient and does not upset the imaging capability of the machine. You can always turn the machine off, but that doesn’t make any noise at all, do you see what I’m saying. You’ve got to get the balance right. That’s what we’re trying to do, come up with a technique which will not impede or impair the image quality but make the whole process more pleasant for the patient.;551;Creativity
Some time has passed now since the first discoveries were made and technology has substantial developed. You can put it in perspective now, I suppose. What is the real significance, what is the big paradigm shift that has come about through this technology?;I think it’s a different type of image that one can produce and an image which carries with it much much more information about the disease state, the disease process and produces this in a very very clear manner, in a manner which is easily recognisable so that to my mind is the major contribution.;551;Meaning(Values) of Work
When you see it back in the history of science the paradigm shift is very often connected with the development of instruments. If you look on Galileo and the telescope, it changed our world view totally. You had Levenhuk and the microscope, it also changed our world view totally. What about this?;I think this will perhaps not be quite so important on broad spectrum as some of the examples that you’ve given, but I think it’s important for the patient and for the diagnosis to have a really good, clear understanding so that intervention for example can be done in a minimalist way, in a way which doesn’t cause further problems, but solves the immediate medical problem. In that sense I am always thinking I have to say, about the patient and patient comfort.;551;Meaning(Values) of Work
This is of course fundamentally important but aren’t you a little bit modest when you play it down this way because looking into the brain and see how we think and maybe also could make images out of our most spiritual experiences. Don’t you think that will somewhat change the way we probably look at courses?;"I’m going to play it down a bit more I think.
Alright.
Sir Peter Mansfield: I’m going to say that imaging of the brain for the study of the mechanism and the way in which the brain works has only just started and it’s extremely difficult for me or anyone else for that matter to predict how this will turn out ultimately. But the first core on imaging is to look at the diseased brain in terms of tumours or other problems associated, other medical conditions associated with this and try to bring relief to the patient so again I’m not really being modest, I think that’s what imaging is about. There may be other important applications but at the moment I think they remain to be demonstrated, it’s to the very early stage. I’m not saying it won’t happen, all I’m saying is that at the present level of development, the major, major application of MRI is going to be in treating sick people.";551;Creativity
But you’re using some very extraordinary phenomenon, down to the nuclear level of atoms and to the electron level of atoms. Do this phenomena exist or are they just measures in your instruments? Does spin exist?;That’s a very deep question and I can’t give you an exact answer. All I can say is that matter behaves as though it has a spin and at the very very tiniest level maybe there is no such thing as spin. It may be that nature conspires in such a way to give one the impression but at the end of the day we have to observe nature and interpret it in a sensible way and when one does this mathematically, it turns out that the best description is one where atoms, the nuclear atoms, actually have spin, but whether they are actually spinning I think is something that I can’t answer.;551;Creativity
But are there all sorts of phenomena deep down in atoms and the molecules and electrons. Can you foresee other phenomenas in other part of matters of behave that could be used for even more spectacular imaging techniques coming in the future? You just talk about protos, what about all the other atoms?;Again I think we’re limited in the materials that have the right sort of microscopic ‘behaviour’ and there is no response to many many materials which where the nuclear have apparently no spin. We are looking for something which at the nuclear level behaves as though it’s a spinning top, but quantum mechanically of course we know that it’s only a manifestation of some deeper state, a deeper state of matter. Maybe nothing is spinning anywhere.;551;Future research
But when it comes to functional imaging we have seen some spectacular films on moving hearts and intestine moving. How far can this be driven do you think? There are hormones running around in our body, there are nerve impulses going around. Will it ever be possible to make imaging of the way life is functioning in such a detail ever?;I would say not. I don’t want to spoil somebody else’s Nobel Prize for the future but I think the problem with people, ordinary folk and particularly film makers, is that you give them something and they always want more. They are not satisfied with the wonders that can already be achieved, they want to push the science if they can and get people to make comments which you can’t possibly substantiate. That’s the problem, I think, with interviews of this time, you always want that little bit more, you won’t be able to push the topic beyond comfort level and that’s all I can say.;551;Future research
“Man is but a worm,” that was the satirical, ironic comment that was given to Charles Darwin when he presented his theory of evolution. The same quotation was used in the Nobel Lecture by Robert Horvitz, and I suppose, Robert Horvitz, that there was a hidden meaning in you showing that picture and doing that quotation.;Robert Horvitz: I don’t know that the meaning was specifically hidden but the point was that it reflects in fact the findings of the three of us combined. Because as we have learned more and more about biology, we find that the biological principles, the biological mechanisms, the precise genes and proteins that one sees in a worm of the sort that we’ve studied, or probably in any other organism, are remarkably similar to those that are present in human beings.;552;Meaning (Values) of Work
“Science is at a crossroad,” is another quotation from the Nobel Lectures. ”Either you decide to do science by press releases or you do science by publication.” That quotation came from the lecture given by John Sulston, what was the meaning of that quotation?;John E. Sulston: I think to be honest probably it’s more biology at the moment. It’s an old issue with science I think, whether one is going to simply make claims. In a previous discussion we were saying how the alchemist practiced science by press release, and he didn’t do very well. The point about press releases is you don’t check the facts behind and what you should do with press releases is to say: Show me your data. Biology is now finding itself in this position because suddenly biology is of commercial value and there’s a great temptation to try to gain financial advantage by issuing statements but not publishing them properly. We’ve had some experience of this with genome work and so that’s why I made a particular point of this, that we must publish openly, show the data and that’s the way science proceeds properly.;552;Impact of the Nobel on you
“We’re drowning in an ocean, or a sea of data but we are starved from knowledge.” That is a quotation from Sydney Brenner’s Nobel Lecture. Sydney Brenner, could you expand a little on that?;Sydney Brenner: Yes, I think we now have unprecedented ability to collect data about nature. Generated of course by our ability to sequence the genomes of complex organisms. You might say that we could in principle make an atom-by-atom description of what there is in nature, but there is now a crisis developing in biology that that completely unstructured information does not enhance understanding. What people want is to understand, which means you must have a theoretical framework in which to embed this. It is interesting that the word science and the word knowledge actually is the same word, so that people who just collect data are not doing science in that sense. I think that this problem will occupy our attention for certainly the next coming decades. Because we need it not only for understanding, but to communicate it and teach it.;552;Impact of Nobel prize on you
By this you have introduced yourselves, all the three Nobel Laureates in Physiology and Medicine. And welcome to the Nobel e-Museum and this interview on your prizes and the science around it. Let’s go back to this issue about differences between knowledge and data, Sydney Brenner. What are the great challenges that lie ahead of bioscience now when the human genome is almost, because it would always be almost completed?;"Sydney Brenner: It was originally said that sequencing the human genome would be like sending a man to the moon, and if you reflect on it, it’s exactly the same. Because sending a man to the moon is very easy, it’s getting him back that’s the problem. I think the metaphor now extends, which is how can we get the human genome back from the moon, because we’ve done the first half. I think everybody knew that the major task would be to find the meaning of the genome, to interpret it. And I think that for more of the more sober people in this field, they’ve realised that the major part of the task still lies ahead. I think that that is going to be absolutely essential. Now there is a tendency in our science to say that everything could be done by this type of factory organisation, that was necessary to sequence the human genome and the other genomes. And there is now an idea afoot that we could just set up all of this to study proteins, to study cells, to study everything. But I’m a great believer in the fact that factories are not necessarily intelligent. And I think that what we’re going to need is human intelligence. I think the belief that we will put all this data into a computer and it will tell us the answer, this is ill-founded.
John E. Sulston: I think it’s a minority who really feel that. I think what you have to guard against is this tendency that people put “-omics” on the end of everything and feel that it’s a new field and it really isn’t. Truth to say, although much drama was made of it and this was really because of the issue of the data release, there was never a very large fraction of science funding spent on the sequencing and I think that’s probably the rule. I think one should continue with large scale projects which have to be highly justified, but always with regard to the problems that they’re going to address. I think it should always be the case that by far the larger part of the funding should be spent on individual problem-solving efforts. If we can keep that balance, then I think we’re alright.
Robert Horvitz: I would absolutely agree with that. One of the comments that echoes in my mind is the comment “don’t forget the biology”. The sea of information indeed does sometimes mask, and the excitement of the acquisition of such amounts of data, sometimes masks the fact that this is simply the foundation. To understand, we do need the basic inquiry. I think that what is really vital is to keep in mind creativity as being much of the source of future progress. Creativity is not the product of either a factory or a committee, the creativity really comes from an individual or sometimes a very small group of individuals, and we must make sure in all contexts that we keep those paths to creativity as open and as supported as we possibly can.
John E. Sulston: I’m particularly pleased that we made a clear expression of this, since we’re here on behalf of the worm, the way the worm DNA sequence was published, it was entitled “A platform for investigating biology”. And there was a rather short paper about the genome itself surrounded by many other papers which were making the first steps towards the analysis that Sydney was speaking of. I’m very pleased that we did that because I think it expresses our feelings very well.";552;Future research
Does that mean that we are focusing in a way too much on the genes? There might be much more interesting knowledge to be gained from complexity and the interaction between all the other things that are around the gene. Who is deciding over the genes?;"Sydney Brenner: I think the complexity problem is the problem. It’s going to be even more enhanced in later years as we begin to tackle such questions as how does the brain work? I think that we need to, and biological systems are unique in that they can encode their own complexity within themselves, so biological systems will be the ones where this new science can be investigated in an objective manner and will form a bridge between the complex systems we ourselves invent, in economic systems and the law governed systems that you find in physics and chemistry. I think biology will occupy intellectually a pivotal role.
Robert Horvitz: I think genes are very important but as we talk about biology, we are of necessity talking about biological complexity, and there are different levels of complexity. We have complexity at the level of genes; we have complexity at the level of cells; we have complexity at the level of networks of cells. As we talk for example about the nervous system, certainly genes provide the framework and the foundation for all that goes on, but some of the problems of the nervous system are probably best addressed not at the level of genes, but rather at the level of cell networks and neural networks. It’s only part of the problem, the genes, and we certainly want to understand at that level but my statement again is don’t forget the biology. The biology is much broader than genes. And some of the studies absolutely have to be carried at these higher levels.";552;Meaning(Values) of Work
But the exciting thing is that it sounds as if there were some general knowledge to be harvested from this theory of complexity that could be applied even to economics and to associated questions or to other complex systems. What is your idea on that, John Sulston?;"John E. Sulston: I’m not sure. People talk a lot about complexity theory. There’s a web thing that keeps being sent to me and I’m not sure that I believe in this abstraction. But of course people should try, if they think they can produce generalisable rules that may be right. One other point, I think the construction of devices is immensely important. I must say, when we come to talk about the human brain, I am one of those who regard it as least as important, the attempt to make intelligent devices. At the moment the words are being misused because none of our devices are intelligent. But nevertheless, as soon as you begin to make machines that learn and indeed evolve in some fashion, then I think we are beginning to use messages from life. In that sense you might be saying that we are using some similar ideas. But whether or not some real understanding of complexity will emerge, or it will be rather the case as Sydney has often said, that you cannot make a description which is shorter than the thing itself. I think we have to find out. But I think we have to explore. I do emphasise, it’s so important that we should use our creativity in this way. I think it’s actually particularly important, it came to light in a comment the other day that maybe Mozart had a completely different sort of creativity from scientists because without Mozart the music wouldn’t have existed, whereas with science we only discover and it’s there. I don’t think that’s true as we go forward in the areas we’re talking about now, because I think our creation will be as important as our discovery.
Sydney Brenner: The answer to the Mozart thing is that the sounds exist in nature and he found the language to put them together in an interesting way. We could take exactly the same view which is that the objects exist in nature and it is the language that we use, whether it’s mathematics or scientific theory, to put them together. I don’t necessarily believe that there is a fundamental difference between them. I think the important thing is that it seems to me, that there are still enormous puzzles in this that are quite difficult to grasp. Because we have now systems of enormous complexity, like the human brain, which has arisen by an evolutionary process from the systems and shows continuity with C-elegans, that something came from C-elegans to reach this level of complexity by a process of mutation, accretion, but not by a process of design, which is the difference between this and man-made objects. And I think that that says to me that there must be some architecture within this that permits that flexibility because for many other systems, we know that if you change them, the most probable consequence is you break them. Whereas through this evolutionary process, nature has achieved something and to comprehend that I think is really a big challenge.
John E. Sulston: The major thing of course is the rearrangement of the parts. I think we now understand that that’s the most likely key role of sexual reproduction. It’s an old puzzle for the geneticists, how organisms are inconveniently diploid, they have two copies of everything. The reason is probably that every generation can get a great rearrangement. Although the process is blind, in fact evolution is indeed arranging the parts. This is more likely to be productive than mutation which is usually destructive or merely adding new bits, and where do you get the new bits from? But if you rearrange old parts which work together in slightly new combinations, you can make much more rapid progress. And I think it’s right to say that’s how evolution has proceeded.
Robert Horvitz: I think evolution is also a key word in the context of the question you raised a few moments ago about complexity. And the question is biological complexity likely to provide models for complexity of other systems? I think the answer is that evolution has done the work of generating a number of solutions and that if we understand those solutions, we can then see at least some cases in which complexity has been defined and we can then ask whether we can apply that knowledge, that framework, in other spheres. My guess is actually that we will be able to do so but probably not in ways that we’ll anticipate until we see what the answers really are. I think in part about devices that have been made in bioengineering, where people have made a variety of prosthetics and other devices, always with the notion that they’re copying biological systems but by and large, what is done before the knowledge of the biology is actually very unlike the biology. But the knowledge of the biology can then change what one can do in the future. I’m perhaps a little bit more optimistic than John of the general principles emerging, but we don’t know ahead of time what they are. Evolution has solved problems.
John E. Sulston: The reason I speak about it negatively, I do feel that complexity is now a buzz word just as chaos was about 10 years ago and it annoys me. It’s like “-omics” over again. Let’s just find out how it works";552;Meaning(Values) of Work
Along the path you understand more and more about how life works, but what would you say would be the most serious challenge to our ethics? What is the most controvert ethical question that will arise out of the science that you are a part of?;"John E. Sulston: I think the challenge to the ethics is ourselves and our social systems actually. I don’t think inherently we are creating worse ethical problems with biology than we did by, for example, inventing nuclear weapons. But in both cases, if we don’t apply the democratic process properly, and of course we do have to bear in mind all the time, as Winston Churchill said that “Democracy is most awful way of governing ourselves until you think about the alternatives.” I think it’s very true that we don’t have any alternative to democracy and unless we apply it properly, and that means a rather full democracy, not a microsecond response referendum but a full democracy in which everybody has a chance to learn and to participate, then I think we might be in some trouble through discrimination of various kinds, and people have painted various horror stories of how we might actually specie-ate ourselves, if the rich ought to start breeding themselves in some clever way. I believe that properly applied social democracy will be a sufficient check on excesses of that kind.
Robert Horvitz: One comment that was made really can be seen in a book written some years ago by Jacques Monod, which he entitled Chance and Necessity. In that he took this topic that Sydney has alluded to, and that is the knowledge that essentially biological organisms have not been designed, they have evolved by chance. And what we see before us just is the consequence of a large number of random events and the selection of those that happened to work better than others. That may, as Monod very well discussed, interface with the issue of ethics because we have to begin to think of ourselves in different ways than perhaps much of human society has thought in the past. Particularly in the context of religion and ethics that are driven by religion. I think what we’re going to need is basically an ethical foundation that is humanity driven as some of these concepts really change with time. But I think those ethics inherently shouldn’t be altered by knowledge, but it’s the responsibility of all of us to make sure that the ethics are very much front and centre stage.";552;Future Research
Given that reproductive cloning could be done as safely as IVF and IXa today without any risk for the child or for the mother. Would reproductive cloning fit into that ethical framework in the future? Sydney Brenner?;"Sydney Brenner: I think your assumption has to be questioned, whether it could be done. No, because I think that I can imagine a society that would accept that. There was a tremendous row over the case of in-vitro fertilisation and many people thought that it was unethical. Of course the argument was that this was of great benefit to a certain group of individuals. In that way now the machinery exists for those people to benefit from it and it’s a safe procedure. What worries me more is that the objectives of human beings in different countries differ, and we have to sit and ponder not so much on the ethics of any procedure, but the ethics of spending large resources say on cardiac transplantation, just to keep away from the genetics, and very little on famine. And I mean it’s that that worries me more, that the world is not a uniform place with a uniform set of standards. I think we have to be careful when we are thinking which leaf is higher than another leaf to be sure which branch we are standing on.
John E. Sulston: In fact I think I would go a little further than that, I would say that the world is in danger of being pushed towards a uniform standard. The standard of the unadulterated marketplace, where indeed the money will continue to be spent on cardiac transplants and drugs that are used mainly by the rich countries, because that’s where the markets are, and the others are neglected. I think in a sense we have a uniform principle and I think it’s wrong. I think we’ve got to have a new principle where we deliberately try and spread the healthcare more evenly and I think this is something we desperately need today.";552;Future research
And you have a recipe or any road ahead for that?;"John E. Sulston: The road ahead? I’m afraid I have to say democracy again, because in the end if it’s not a democratic voice then it won’t work. But I think what’s happening is that our great world organisations, the World Trade Organisation and also the World Health Organisation, are much more nearly one vote, one dollar than one vote, one person or one country as they should be. I think it’s up to us. I think we actually share a rather higher platform than we did a couple of months ago for speaking about these matters, so it’s important that we do think about them. I think that we should press for this.
Robert Horvitz: I think democracy is a key word, but I think what we need is an enlightened democracy, because in a democracy there is always the risk of the rule of the majority to the detriment of the minority. In this case we’re talking about the rule of the minority to the detriment of the majority, so it’s more extreme. But I think even in the case where it’s a majority we have to make sure that the rights and privileges of the minority are very well maintained and supported. I think that we need education. I think we need leadership to really inform and perhaps even persuade the majority of people who are making decisions that it is in their interest as well as in the interest of humanity in general to follow the kinds of paths that have just been described.";552;Creativity
When the genome project was almost finished, President Clinton and the British Prime Minister met at a press conference announcing this completion of the genome. Then President Clinton said: “Now, maybe we have seen the language in which God created Man”, and Sydney Brenner, you wrote a comment on that.;"Sydney Brenner: I think that what I wrote on that is in the same way we could view the Bible as the language which man used to create God. That was just a comment like that. I think that that’s a very, how shall I say, exaggerated way of putting it.
Your saying or Clinton’s saying?
Sydney Brenner: Clinton’s saying. Because I think it has to pay respects to certain views in society and it’s not the language which anybody used to create man.
Because you have said very clearly that the architecture is inside the structure.
Sydney Brenner: The architecture is inside and I still think that that is the question of how this … This is why I think ordinary people don’t believe in evolution because we’re telling them by random changes that we can change a black and white television set into a colour television set. And everybody says there’s no way that can happen because if I try and change a television set, I’ll break it. That’s what will happen. And that is why a lot of questions about the internal architecture become important. That mutation happens but certain mutations carry a greater value than others. And we need to understand, so clearly mutations which affect the language of gene regulation are going to be more profoundly important than ones which just might affect the function of a protein.";552;Meaning (Values) of Work
Maybe Robert Horvitz, couldn’t Sydney Brenner’s statement about the Bible be interpreted seriously? Given the mutations work finally gives us consciousness and awareness and we have created God or made him. The Bible was the language in which we describe what we think is the higher meaning for life.;"Sydney Brenner: Exactly, yes, it’s a deeper thought than is done in terms of what it was alluding to. It was double edged, and one edge was what you said, the other edge was to say, it’s a more comic way of looking at the human genome.
John E. Sulston: I think that there is a serious point there. But incidentally, what I would like just to replace the President’s remark with is that what we’ve done is to read the language of evolution. As Sydney emphasises, and he’s absolutely right, we don’t understand it. But nevertheless, we have the hieroglyph, we know how we brush the sand off the hieroglyph and now we’re working on its interpretation, I think. But to the other point, I think we do have, and that’s why I agree so much with what Bob said about trying to develop a real humanist basis for ethics. Because after all it’s not just the Bible, it’s the Koran, it’s a zillion other writings, all of which are more or less contradictory, all of which incidentally are very capable of leading people to physical combat and really serious warfare over points which were written in these books. I think we can develop serious humanism, but we do only have a limited amount of time because I do think we are going to understand the workings of our brain in much greater detail. I do think that we’re going to come much closer maybe to have a full understanding of what we really mean by self-consciousness and free will. By understanding what I mean is, and it is going to be complex, that in some fashion we’ll be able to write down all the components. Now the question is what will that mean? How can one comprehend oneself? It’s like trying to understand the Klein bottle. It’s a real paradox.
I suspect the way we shall do it is to actually understand all the pieces but nevertheless not be able to hold an image of how it works all at once in our own heads. You can sort of trace around the pathway and do each bit at a time. I think most of us actually feel like that thinking about relativity, I certainly do. I can do the bits but just getting the whole thing, it just won’t gel for me. Now the reason I say it’s urgent is that I think we are going to, at the same time, be increasing our physical power, our power of the biological world and we have got to come to a way of making responsible decisions about how to use these things, and to come to the point where we’re going to do it in the knowledge where we really cannot sustain the idea reasonably of us being driven all the time by some higher thing, but rather seriously regard ourselves as products of the evolution. I think we are going to have to have that sort of social ethical revolution. It’s going to be needed over the next 50 years or so. I think it’s a very, very urgent matter and one that’s very worth paying attention to, to try and contribute.";552;Meaning (Values) of Work

I think the metaphor now extends, which is how can we get the human genome back from the moon, because we’ve done the first half. I think everybody knew that the major task would be to find the meaning of the genome, to interpret it. And I think that for more of the more sober people in this field, they’ve realised that the major part of the task still lies ahead. I think that that is going to be absolutely essential. Now there is a tendency in our science to say that everything could be done by this type of factory organisation, that was necessary to sequence the human genome and the other genomes. And there is now an idea afoot that we could just set up all of this to study proteins, to study cells, to study everything. But I’m a great believer in the fact that factories are not necessarily intelligent. And I think that what we’re going to need is human intelligence. I think the belief that we will put all this data into a computer and it will tell us the answer, this is ill-founded.
John E. Sulston: I think it’s a minority who really feel that. I think what you have to guard against is this tendency that people put “-omics” on the end of everything and feel that it’s a new field and it really isn’t. Truth to say, although much drama was made of it and this was really because of the issue of the data release, there was never a very large fraction of science funding spent on the sequencing and I think that’s probably the rule. I think one should continue with large scale projects which have to be highly justified, but always with regard to the problems that they’re going to address. I think it should always be the case that by far the larger part of the funding should be spent on individual problem-solving efforts. If we can keep that balance, then I think we’re alright.
Robert Horvitz: I would absolutely agree with that. One of the comments that echoes in my mind is the comment “don’t forget the biology”. The sea of information indeed does sometimes mask, and the excitement of the acquisition of such amounts of data, sometimes masks the fact that this is simply the foundation. To understand, we do need the basic inquiry. I think that what is really vital is to keep in mind creativity as being much of the source of future progress. Creativity is not the product of either a factory or a committee, the creativity really comes from an individual or sometimes a very small group of individuals, and we must make sure in all contexts that we keep those paths to creativity as open and as supported as we possibly can.
John E. Sulston: I’m particularly pleased that we made a clear expression of this, since we’re here on behalf of the worm, the way the worm DNA sequence was published, it was entitled “A platform for investigating biology”. And there was a rather short paper about the genome itself surrounded by many other papers which were making the first steps towards the analysis that Sydney was speaking of. I’m very pleased that we did that because I think it expresses our feelings very well.";553;Future research
Does that mean that we are focusing in a way too much on the genes? There might be much more interesting knowledge to be gained from complexity and the interaction between all the other things that are around the gene. Who is deciding over the genes?;"Sydney Brenner: I think the complexity problem is the problem. It’s going to be even more enhanced in later years as we begin to tackle such questions as how does the brain work? I think that we need to, and biological systems are unique in that they can encode their own complexity within themselves, so biological systems will be the ones where this new science can be investigated in an objective manner and will form a bridge between the complex systems we ourselves invent, in economic systems and the law governed systems that you find in physics and chemistry. I think biology will occupy intellectually a pivotal role.
Robert Horvitz: I think genes are very important but as we talk about biology, we are of necessity talking about biological complexity, and there are different levels of complexity. We have complexity at the level of genes; we have complexity at the level of cells; we have complexity at the level of networks of cells. As we talk for example about the nervous system, certainly genes provide the framework and the foundation for all that goes on, but some of the problems of the nervous system are probably best addressed not at the level of genes, but rather at the level of cell networks and neural networks. It’s only part of the problem, the genes, and we certainly want to understand at that level but my statement again is don’t forget the biology. The biology is much broader than genes. And some of the studies absolutely have to be carried at these higher levels.";553;Meaning(Values) of Work
But the exciting thing is that it sounds as if there were some general knowledge to be harvested from this theory of complexity that could be applied even to economics and to associated questions or to other complex systems. What is your idea on that, John Sulston?;"John E. Sulston: I’m not sure. People talk a lot about complexity theory. There’s a web thing that keeps being sent to me and I’m not sure that I believe in this abstraction. But of course people should try, if they think they can produce generalisable rules that may be right. One other point, I think the construction of devices is immensely important. I must say, when we come to talk about the human brain, I am one of those who regard it as least as important, the attempt to make intelligent devices. At the moment the words are being misused because none of our devices are intelligent. But nevertheless, as soon as you begin to make machines that learn and indeed evolve in some fashion, then I think we are beginning to use messages from life. In that sense you might be saying that we are using some similar ideas. But whether or not some real understanding of complexity will emerge, or it will be rather the case as Sydney has often said, that you cannot make a description which is shorter than the thing itself. I think we have to find out. But I think we have to explore. I do emphasise, it’s so important that we should use our creativity in this way. I think it’s actually particularly important, it came to light in a comment the other day that maybe Mozart had a completely different sort of creativity from scientists because without Mozart the music wouldn’t have existed, whereas with science we only discover and it’s there. I don’t think that’s true as we go forward in the areas we’re talking about now, because I think our creation will be as important as our discovery.
Sydney Brenner: The answer to the Mozart thing is that the sounds exist in nature and he found the language to put them together in an interesting way. We could take exactly the same view which is that the objects exist in nature and it is the language that we use, whether it’s mathematics or scientific theory, to put them together. I don’t necessarily believe that there is a fundamental difference between them. I think the important thing is that it seems to me, that there are still enormous puzzles in this that are quite difficult to grasp. Because we have now systems of enormous complexity, like the human brain, which has arisen by an evolutionary process from the systems and shows continuity with C-elegans, that something came from C-elegans to reach this level of complexity by a process of mutation, accretion, but not by a process of design, which is the difference between this and man-made objects. And I think that that says to me that there must be some architecture within this that permits that flexibility because for many other systems, we know that if you change them, the most probable consequence is you break them. Whereas through this evolutionary process, nature has achieved something and to comprehend that I think is really a big challenge.
John E. Sulston: The major thing of course is the rearrangement of the parts. I think we now understand that that’s the most likely key role of sexual reproduction. It’s an old puzzle for the geneticists, how organisms are inconveniently diploid, they have two copies of everything. The reason is probably that every generation can get a great rearrangement. Although the process is blind, in fact evolution is indeed arranging the parts. This is more likely to be productive than mutation which is usually destructive or merely adding new bits, and where do you get the new bits from? But if you rearrange old parts which work together in slightly new combinations, you can make much more rapid progress. And I think it’s right to say that’s how evolution has proceeded.
Robert Horvitz: I think evolution is also a key word in the context of the question you raised a few moments ago about complexity. And the question is biological complexity likely to provide models for complexity of other systems? I think the answer is that evolution has done the work of generating a number of solutions and that if we understand those solutions, we can then see at least some cases in which complexity has been defined and we can then ask whether we can apply that knowledge, that framework, in other spheres. My guess is actually that we will be able to do so but probably not in ways that we’ll anticipate until we see what the answers really are. I think in part about devices that have been made in bioengineering, where people have made a variety of prosthetics and other devices, always with the notion that they’re copying biological systems but by and large, what is done before the knowledge of the biology is actually very unlike the biology. But the knowledge of the biology can then change what one can do in the future. I’m perhaps a little bit more optimistic than John of the general principles emerging, but we don’t know ahead of time what they are. Evolution has solved problems.
John E. Sulston: The reason I speak about it negatively, I do feel that complexity is now a buzz word just as chaos was about 10 years ago and it annoys me. It’s like “-omics” over again. Let’s just find out how it works";553;Meaning(Values) of Work
Along the path you understand more and more about how life works, but what would you say would be the most serious challenge to our ethics? What is the most controvert ethical question that will arise out of the science that you are a part of?;"John E. Sulston: I think the challenge to the ethics is ourselves and our social systems actually. I don’t think inherently we are creating worse ethical problems with biology than we did by, for example, inventing nuclear weapons. But in both cases, if we don’t apply the democratic process properly, and of course we do have to bear in mind all the time, as Winston Churchill said that “Democracy is most awful way of governing ourselves until you think about the alternatives.” I think it’s very true that we don’t have any alternative to democracy and unless we apply it properly, and that means a rather full democracy, not a microsecond response referendum but a full democracy in which everybody has a chance to learn and to participate, then I think we might be in some trouble through discrimination of various kinds, and people have painted various horror stories of how we might actually specie-ate ourselves, if the rich ought to start breeding themselves in some clever way. I believe that properly applied social democracy will be a sufficient check on excesses of that kind.
Robert Horvitz: One comment that was made really can be seen in a book written some years ago by Jacques Monod, which he entitled Chance and Necessity. In that he took this topic that Sydney has alluded to, and that is the knowledge that essentially biological organisms have not been designed, they have evolved by chance. And what we see before us just is the consequence of a large number of random events and the selection of those that happened to work better than others. That may, as Monod very well discussed, interface with the issue of ethics because we have to begin to think of ourselves in different ways than perhaps much of human society has thought in the past. Particularly in the context of religion and ethics that are driven by religion. I think what we’re going to need is basically an ethical foundation that is humanity driven as some of these concepts really change with time. But I think those ethics inherently shouldn’t be altered by knowledge, but it’s the responsibility of all of us to make sure that the ethics are very much front and centre stage.";553;Future Research
Given that reproductive cloning could be done as safely as IVF and IXa today without any risk for the child or for the mother. Would reproductive cloning fit into that ethical framework in the future? Sydney Brenner?;"Sydney Brenner: I think your assumption has to be questioned, whether it could be done. No, because I think that I can imagine a society that would accept that. There was a tremendous row over the case of in-vitro fertilisation and many people thought that it was unethical. Of course the argument was that this was of great benefit to a certain group of individuals. In that way now the machinery exists for those people to benefit from it and it’s a safe procedure. What worries me more is that the objectives of human beings in different countries differ, and we have to sit and ponder not so much on the ethics of any procedure, but the ethics of spending large resources say on cardiac transplantation, just to keep away from the genetics, and very little on famine. And I mean it’s that that worries me more, that the world is not a uniform place with a uniform set of standards. I think we have to be careful when we are thinking which leaf is higher than another leaf to be sure which branch we are standing on.
John E. Sulston: In fact I think I would go a little further than that, I would say that the world is in danger of being pushed towards a uniform standard. The standard of the unadulterated marketplace, where indeed the money will continue to be spent on cardiac transplants and drugs that are used mainly by the rich countries, because that’s where the markets are, and the others are neglected. I think in a sense we have a uniform principle and I think it’s wrong. I think we’ve got to have a new principle where we deliberately try and spread the healthcare more evenly and I think this is something we desperately need today.";553;Future research
And you have a recipe or any road ahead for that?;"John E. Sulston: The road ahead? I’m afraid I have to say democracy again, because in the end if it’s not a democratic voice then it won’t work. But I think what’s happening is that our great world organisations, the World Trade Organisation and also the World Health Organisation, are much more nearly one vote, one dollar than one vote, one person or one country as they should be. I think it’s up to us. I think we actually share a rather higher platform than we did a couple of months ago for speaking about these matters, so it’s important that we do think about them. I think that we should press for this.
Robert Horvitz: I think democracy is a key word, but I think what we need is an enlightened democracy, because in a democracy there is always the risk of the rule of the majority to the detriment of the minority. In this case we’re talking about the rule of the minority to the detriment of the majority, so it’s more extreme. But I think even in the case where it’s a majority we have to make sure that the rights and privileges of the minority are very well maintained and supported. I think that we need education. I think we need leadership to really inform and perhaps even persuade the majority of people who are making decisions that it is in their interest as well as in the interest of humanity in general to follow the kinds of paths that have just been described.";553;Creativity
When the genome project was almost finished, President Clinton and the British Prime Minister met at a press conference announcing this completion of the genome. Then President Clinton said: “Now, maybe we have seen the language in which God created Man”, and Sydney Brenner, you wrote a comment on that.;"Sydney Brenner: I think that what I wrote on that is in the same way we could view the Bible as the language which man used to create God. That was just a comment like that. I think that that’s a very, how shall I say, exaggerated way of putting it.
Your saying or Clinton’s saying?
Sydney Brenner: Clinton’s saying. Because I think it has to pay respects to certain views in society and it’s not the language which anybody used to create man.
Because you have said very clearly that the architecture is inside the structure.
Sydney Brenner: The architecture is inside and I still think that that is the question of how this … This is why I think ordinary people don’t believe in evolution because we’re telling them by random changes that we can change a black and white television set into a colour television set. And everybody says there’s no way that can happen because if I try and change a television set, I’ll break it. That’s what will happen. And that is why a lot of questions about the internal architecture become important. That mutation happens but certain mutations carry a greater value than others. And we need to understand, so clearly mutations which affect the language of gene regulation are going to be more profoundly important than ones which just might affect the function of a protein.";553;Meaning (Values) of Work
Maybe Robert Horvitz, couldn’t Sydney Brenner’s statement about the Bible be interpreted seriously? Given the mutations work finally gives us consciousness and awareness and we have created God or made him. The Bible was the language in which we describe what we think is the higher meaning for life.;"Sydney Brenner: Exactly, yes, it’s a deeper thought than is done in terms of what it was alluding to. It was double edged, and one edge was what you said, the other edge was to say, it’s a more comic way of looking at the human genome.
John E. Sulston: I think that there is a serious point there. But incidentally, what I would like just to replace the President’s remark with is that what we’ve done is to read the language of evolution. As Sydney emphasises, and he’s absolutely right, we don’t understand it. But nevertheless, we have the hieroglyph, we know how we brush the sand off the hieroglyph and now we’re working on its interpretation, I think. But to the other point, I think we do have, and that’s why I agree so much with what Bob said about trying to develop a real humanist basis for ethics. Because after all it’s not just the Bible, it’s the Koran, it’s a zillion other writings, all of which are more or less contradictory, all of which incidentally are very capable of leading people to physical combat and really serious warfare over points which were written in these books. I think we can develop serious humanism, but we do only have a limited amount of time because I do think we are going to understand the workings of our brain in much greater detail. I do think that we’re going to come much closer maybe to have a full understanding of what we really mean by self-consciousness and free will. By understanding what I mean is, and it is going to be complex, that in some fashion we’ll be able to write down all the components. Now the question is what will that mean? How can one comprehend oneself? It’s like trying to understand the Klein bottle. It’s a real paradox.
I suspect the way we shall do it is to actually understand all the pieces but nevertheless not be able to hold an image of how it works all at once in our own heads. You can sort of trace around the pathway and do each bit at a time. I think most of us actually feel like that thinking about relativity, I certainly do. I can do the bits but just getting the whole thing, it just won’t gel for me. Now the reason I say it’s urgent is that I think we are going to, at the same time, be increasing our physical power, our power of the biological world and we have got to come to a way of making responsible decisions about how to use these things, and to come to the point where we’re going to do it in the knowledge where we really cannot sustain the idea reasonably of us being driven all the time by some higher thing, but rather seriously regard ourselves as products of the evolution. I think we are going to have to have that sort of social ethical revolution. It’s going to be needed over the next 50 years or so. I think it’s a very, very urgent matter and one that’s very worth paying attention to, to try and contribute.";553;Meaning (Values) of Work
“Man is but a worm,” that was the satirical, ironic comment that was given to Charles Darwin when he presented his theory of evolution. The same quotation was used in the Nobel Lecture by Robert Horvitz, and I suppose, Robert Horvitz, that there was a hidden meaning in you showing that picture and doing that quotation.;Robert Horvitz: I don’t know that the meaning was specifically hidden but the point was that it reflects in fact the findings of the three of us combined. Because as we have learned more and more about biology, we find that the biological principles, the biological mechanisms, the precise genes and proteins that one sees in a worm of the sort that we’ve studied, or probably in any other organism, are remarkably similar to those that are present in human beings.;554;Meaning (Values) of Work
“Science is at a crossroad,” is another quotation from the Nobel Lectures. ”Either you decide to do science by press releases or you do science by publication.” That quotation came from the lecture given by John Sulston, what was the meaning of that quotation?;John E. Sulston: I think to be honest probably it’s more biology at the moment. It’s an old issue with science I think, whether one is going to simply make claims. In a previous discussion we were saying how the alchemist practiced science by press release, and he didn’t do very well. The point about press releases is you don’t check the facts behind and what you should do with press releases is to say: Show me your data. Biology is now finding itself in this position because suddenly biology is of commercial value and there’s a great temptation to try to gain financial advantage by issuing statements but not publishing them properly. We’ve had some experience of this with genome work and so that’s why I made a particular point of this, that we must publish openly, show the data and that’s the way science proceeds properly.;554;Impact of the Nobel on you
“We’re drowning in an ocean, or a sea of data but we are starved from knowledge.” That is a quotation from Sydney Brenner’s Nobel Lecture. Sydney Brenner, could you expand a little on that?;Sydney Brenner: Yes, I think we now have unprecedented ability to collect data about nature. Generated of course by our ability to sequence the genomes of complex organisms. You might say that we could in principle make an atom-by-atom description of what there is in nature, but there is now a crisis developing in biology that that completely unstructured information does not enhance understanding. What people want is to understand, which means you must have a theoretical framework in which to embed this. It is interesting that the word science and the word knowledge actually is the same word, so that people who just collect data are not doing science in that sense. I think that this problem will occupy our attention for certainly the next coming decades. Because we need it not only for understanding, but to communicate it and teach it.;554;Impact of Nobel prize on you
By this you have introduced yourselves, all the three Nobel Laureates in Physiology and Medicine. And welcome to the Nobel e-Museum and this interview on your prizes and the science around it. Let’s go back to this issue about differences between knowledge and data, Sydney Brenner. What are the great challenges that lie ahead of bioscience now when the human genome is almost, because it would always be almost completed?;"Sydney Brenner: It was originally said that sequencing the human genome would be like sending a man to the moon, and if you reflect on it, it’s exactly the same.

Particularly in the context of religion and ethics that are driven by religion. I think what we’re going to need is basically an ethical foundation that is humanity driven as some of these concepts really change with time. But I think those ethics inherently shouldn’t be altered by knowledge, but it’s the responsibility of all of us to make sure that the ethics are very much front and centre stage.";554;Future Research
Given that reproductive cloning could be done as safely as IVF and IXa today without any risk for the child or for the mother. Would reproductive cloning fit into that ethical framework in the future? Sydney Brenner?;"Sydney Brenner: I think your assumption has to be questioned, whether it could be done. No, because I think that I can imagine a society that would accept that. There was a tremendous row over the case of in-vitro fertilisation and many people thought that it was unethical. Of course the argument was that this was of great benefit to a certain group of individuals. In that way now the machinery exists for those people to benefit from it and it’s a safe procedure. What worries me more is that the objectives of human beings in different countries differ, and we have to sit and ponder not so much on the ethics of any procedure, but the ethics of spending large resources say on cardiac transplantation, just to keep away from the genetics, and very little on famine. And I mean it’s that that worries me more, that the world is not a uniform place with a uniform set of standards. I think we have to be careful when we are thinking which leaf is higher than another leaf to be sure which branch we are standing on.
John E. Sulston: In fact I think I would go a little further than that, I would say that the world is in danger of being pushed towards a uniform standard. The standard of the unadulterated marketplace, where indeed the money will continue to be spent on cardiac transplants and drugs that are used mainly by the rich countries, because that’s where the markets are, and the others are neglected. I think in a sense we have a uniform principle and I think it’s wrong. I think we’ve got to have a new principle where we deliberately try and spread the healthcare more evenly and I think this is something we desperately need today.";554;Future research
And you have a recipe or any road ahead for that?;"John E. Sulston: The road ahead? I’m afraid I have to say democracy again, because in the end if it’s not a democratic voice then it won’t work. But I think what’s happening is that our great world organisations, the World Trade Organisation and also the World Health Organisation, are much more nearly one vote, one dollar than one vote, one person or one country as they should be. I think it’s up to us. I think we actually share a rather higher platform than we did a couple of months ago for speaking about these matters, so it’s important that we do think about them. I think that we should press for this.
Robert Horvitz: I think democracy is a key word, but I think what we need is an enlightened democracy, because in a democracy there is always the risk of the rule of the majority to the detriment of the minority. In this case we’re talking about the rule of the minority to the detriment of the majority, so it’s more extreme. But I think even in the case where it’s a majority we have to make sure that the rights and privileges of the minority are very well maintained and supported. I think that we need education. I think we need leadership to really inform and perhaps even persuade the majority of people who are making decisions that it is in their interest as well as in the interest of humanity in general to follow the kinds of paths that have just been described.";554;Creativity
When the genome project was almost finished, President Clinton and the British Prime Minister met at a press conference announcing this completion of the genome. Then President Clinton said: “Now, maybe we have seen the language in which God created Man”, and Sydney Brenner, you wrote a comment on that.;"Sydney Brenner: I think that what I wrote on that is in the same way we could view the Bible as the language which man used to create God. That was just a comment like that. I think that that’s a very, how shall I say, exaggerated way of putting it.
Your saying or Clinton’s saying?
Sydney Brenner: Clinton’s saying. Because I think it has to pay respects to certain views in society and it’s not the language which anybody used to create man.
Because you have said very clearly that the architecture is inside the structure.
Sydney Brenner: The architecture is inside and I still think that that is the question of how this … This is why I think ordinary people don’t believe in evolution because we’re telling them by random changes that we can change a black and white television set into a colour television set. And everybody says there’s no way that can happen because if I try and change a television set, I’ll break it. That’s what will happen. And that is why a lot of questions about the internal architecture become important. That mutation happens but certain mutations carry a greater value than others. And we need to understand, so clearly mutations which affect the language of gene regulation are going to be more profoundly important than ones which just might affect the function of a protein.";554;Meaning (Values) of Work
Maybe Robert Horvitz, couldn’t Sydney Brenner’s statement about the Bible be interpreted seriously? Given the mutations work finally gives us consciousness and awareness and we have created God or made him. The Bible was the language in which we describe what we think is the higher meaning for life.;"Sydney Brenner: Exactly, yes, it’s a deeper thought than is done in terms of what it was alluding to. It was double edged, and one edge was what you said, the other edge was to say, it’s a more comic way of looking at the human genome.
John E. Sulston: I think that there is a serious point there. But incidentally, what I would like just to replace the President’s remark with is that what we’ve done is to read the language of evolution. As Sydney emphasises, and he’s absolutely right, we don’t understand it. But nevertheless, we have the hieroglyph, we know how we brush the sand off the hieroglyph and now we’re working on its interpretation, I think. But to the other point, I think we do have, and that’s why I agree so much with what Bob said about trying to develop a real humanist basis for ethics. Because after all it’s not just the Bible, it’s the Koran, it’s a zillion other writings, all of which are more or less contradictory, all of which incidentally are very capable of leading people to physical combat and really serious warfare over points which were written in these books. I think we can develop serious humanism, but we do only have a limited amount of time because I do think we are going to understand the workings of our brain in much greater detail. I do think that we’re going to come much closer maybe to have a full understanding of what we really mean by self-consciousness and free will. By understanding what I mean is, and it is going to be complex, that in some fashion we’ll be able to write down all the components. Now the question is what will that mean? How can one comprehend oneself? It’s like trying to understand the Klein bottle. It’s a real paradox.
I suspect the way we shall do it is to actually understand all the pieces but nevertheless not be able to hold an image of how it works all at once in our own heads. You can sort of trace around the pathway and do each bit at a time. I think most of us actually feel like that thinking about relativity, I certainly do. I can do the bits but just getting the whole thing, it just won’t gel for me. Now the reason I say it’s urgent is that I think we are going to, at the same time, be increasing our physical power, our power of the biological world and we have got to come to a way of making responsible decisions about how to use these things, and to come to the point where we’re going to do it in the knowledge where we really cannot sustain the idea reasonably of us being driven all the time by some higher thing, but rather seriously regard ourselves as products of the evolution. I think we are going to have to have that sort of social ethical revolution. It’s going to be needed over the next 50 years or so. I think it’s a very, very urgent matter and one that’s very worth paying attention to, to try and contribute.";554;Meaning (Values) of Work
But is it true you are the royalties is of a scientific community for one year now or for the rest of your life?;"Leland Hartwell: Certainly feel it during this celebration here.
Sir Paul Nurse: But of course, science moves on so in fact the Kings get changed very quickly.";555;Creativity
Oh yes, those days, no scientist is happier as the one which can prove that the professor was wrong.;"Sir Paul Nurse: Correct. That’s one of the beauties of science that it does move on and there isn’t a received wisdom that just stays in one place with one person.
Tim Hunt: But at the same time there were giants present here, this week, I’m thinking people like Jim Watson, I’m thinking of people like François Jacob, thinking of people like Günter Blobel, they haven’t been disapproved, they put a new big step on our constant stairway of knowledge.";555;Creativity
But does that mean that science actually really is coming closer and closer to reality? There are some truths that remain truths even throughout the centuries.;"Sir Paul Nurse: This is quite complex philosophically because we tend to work in certain paradigms and for a while in fact we put these bricks in the wall as Tim was alluding to within that paradigm, but then you can get a real shift which takes you into a sort of different area altogether. That’s certainly been the case in physics at the beginning of the last century with quantum mechanics and relativity there was a real shift from Newtonian paradigms of the previous two and a half centuries. In biology it’s sometimes a little bit more difficult to see that.
Tim Hunt: That’s really happened in biology, you know, the establishment of the cell theory and then Pasteur proves that there’s no such thing as spontaneous creation, these are sort of universal truths.";555;Creativity
But what differentiation that everyone thought that higher animals could never be cloned and then all of a sudden there’s a Dolly. Isn’t that a major shift in how you perceived DNA?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think that not sure so much in the sense that was a technical achievement but it had been achieved with frogs actually that particular …
But not with high animals.
Leland Hartwell: Frogs are very high animals …
Tim Hunt: The frog is a high animal. What do you mean, were you trying to despise the poor frog?
Sir Paul Nurse: You’re talking to a …
Tim Hunt: You’re talking to the wrong people of course, we love frogs. They are called low organisms, but we love them.
Sir Paul Nurse: You’re talking to a CO and two /- – -/ here and frogs are something up there, very complex to us.
Leland Hartwell: But in terms of paradigms we are in an era now, from about the last 30 or 40 years, where we are sort of enumerating the molecular pieces, we’re making catalogues of who the players are in different processes and we’re already beginning to see the end of that era and a new era of you know, what are the properties of assemblies and modules and circuits of these groups.
Tim Hunt: Emergent properties ensemble of all of those subunits, sorry sub-assemblies.";555;Meaning(Values) of Work
But anyway, if you excuse me, in one way you have solved the easy problem and now you come to the real difficult problem.;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think Lee, I mean this is why I was referring to paradigm shifts with physics which is clear, because I have a feeling there will be a paradigm shift in biology. I like to think of it a little bit like this a metaphor is that we’ve been identifying the actors in a play and we now have to write the script, and we’ve been identifying a lot of the molecules, the elements but actually putting it all together is in the symphony analogy or the play analogy requires maybe different sorts of thinking I actually am beginning to wonder.
Leland Hartwell: What’s easy and what’s hard depends on the era, I think when we began our careers and were interested in dissecting some of the complexity of cell biology that was considered very mysterious and difficult and impossible but we’re moving beyond that era now and now people see that as relatively straight forward but how all things work together now appears to be a big mystery.
Tim Hunt: I think one of the curious things … I mean I never really seriously thought in my lifetime to see so much progress and developmental biology. I think Eric Wieschaus and Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard – this was extraordinary what they did – that was one of my favourite prizes of recent years actually, because the deep deep mystery and suddenly it’s all plain.";555;Creativity
But nevertheless do you think there is need for a total new concept? Because you made a wonderful metaphor at your banquet speech about the cell being a symphony orchestra. You could maybe add that life was the music and you could have included the audience and even if you can analyse the conductor, could you then explain the symphony orchestra by looking at the details?;"Leland Hartwell: I think that’s a metaphor of the transition that’s taking place is that as we learn more and more of the individual musicians, if you will, and what it is that they do as individuals we don’t yet understand how the whole assembly creates something that is as beautiful and mysterious as a cell dividing or just a cell metabolising or any of the wonderful things that cells do. That’s the era that I think most biologists, molecular biologists would say we’re moving into now, is how does the properties emerge.
Tim Hunt: It’s becoming much more … I’m so pleased that we have a prize for physiology because I think that’s exactly where we’re going, it’s molecular physiology from now on by which I mean that how things work together, right. It’s all very well having … we’ve sort of come out of a chemical phase almost and I think we’re entering a real physiological phase.";555;Meaning(Values) of Work
But I mean science is per definition reductionistic. How you look at structures, you look at details, and life is time- and spacedependent and dynamics and interactive. You have looked at frozen moments of details, can you ever understand system …;"Tim Hunt: Oh sure, look at the way that muscles and nerves work for example, was done a long time ago. It’s funny, sometimes things are done from the top down and sometimes done from the bottom up.
Sir Paul Nurse: I often think too much is made of this reductionism holism difference. Of course science has to explain in terms of basic components or elements or sub systems but nearly all of us working at a holistic framework looking at the overall system. The challenge we have now is in particularly in the life sciences is that these systems are actually quite complicated, in fact very complicated and unlike for example in chemistry and physics where you have lots of objects behaving identically like atoms, what we have is lots of objects which don’t behave identically
Tim Hunt: Which interact and each feedback positively and negatively with each other. It’s very complicated and the trick of doing successful science is from isolating the simplicity out of that complexity otherwise you’re lost. It’s all very well to look at a dividing cell and going, ‘Gosh, this is marvellous’! but it doesn’t help you understand what’s going on behind the scenes.
Sir Paul Nurse: I think that’s absolutely right, but now we’ve got to start thinking. We have all this individual components, behaving in different ways, interact in different ways and we’ve got to somehow extract the general principles from that behaviour and try and get … You can use these words like emerge and properties or whatever, they often raise more heat than light when you use these terms, it must be said, but I think there is a challenge there and describing the dynamics of this in real space and real time. which we’re just beginning to do in cell biology. I think a brave new world is going to come from this, I’m an optimist I must say, but I think that it’s very exciting times.
Leland Hartwell: I think there’s another thing too to say about reductionism is that you take some global property and you try to explain it at the next level down and the next level down may just be cell society. We’re now very concentrated on the molecular level but as we start asking how cells behave the right description may not be in molecules, the right description may be in circuits or modules or certain properties, so creating the right concepts to go the next level down is sort of the nature of reductionism and the creative part.";555;Meaning(Values) of Work
Which means that you can find some very precise detail in hierarchy that is really governing the next level;"Tim Hunt: Yes, the clue to the whole thing.
Sir Paul Nurse: I think there’s two ways actually to answer that: One is, which is perhaps what we’ve done, which is to focus on certain components and elements which are crucial and critical and I think that that falls naturally out of our analysis. I think a second way of viewing this, which I think is what Lee was hinting at, is could we describe general properties of these systems, are there rules that would govern general properties which don’t require going down to specific behaviours of individual components but when in a certain assemblage give rise to behaviours that are interesting. I think that’s perhaps what you were getting at.
Leland Hartwell: Exactly, we have our signalling system, cells respond to signals for example and they may respond over a certain concentration range, they may respond by flipping states or by a gradual transition. These are sort of dynamic concepts that don’t necessary require molecular explanation but require some kind of probably creative conceptualisation that may be different than anything we think of right now.
Tim Hunt: I know there’s an economist might describe an economy, sort of abstractable principles.
Leland Hartwell: Exactly, yes";555;Advice for young scientists
Does that also mean that you are looking for inspiration from other areas of science, like scientists who are dealing with the mathematics, the complex system, dealing with the scientists from economy are trying to do mathematics for complex systems.;"Leland Hartwell: Yes, very much. I think one important area that we can learn a lot about molecular circuits from, or from electronic circuits in order to understand a complex circuit, what you’d really like to have is a very detailed description of the input/output characteristics, as you perturb the system how does it respond. We don’t usually have that for many of our biological circuits, we know what the components are but we don’t know how the input/output are related in any quantitative terms.
Sir Paul Nurse: Because I’d like to push that metaphor even further. It may be by knowing the sorts of components that you have and by knowing that they can be connected in certain ways. In fact all the huge variety that is possible may not actually be occurring because it may be that the only linking certain components that behave in certain ways in particular ways that may only generate certain stable operating systems and that we’re not actually faced with immense complexity we’re faced with a few solutions. If we can identify the rules for getting those solutions, we’ll simplify the problem.";555;Motivation
But given that you’re right, what will the implications be? Finding the simple rules that govern complex systems, you said ‘brave new world’, it really sounds something in that direction, Tim?;"Sir Paul Nurse: He’s more sceptical of …
Tim Hunt: I think, it’s very interesting. Paul likes theoretical biology and he has some good friends who are rather good theoretical biologists but my own view is that these approaches so far have not been very successful. Partly because we don’t even know the parts, secondly because it’s very difficult to measure accurately the properties of those parts. There are certain kinetic constants about how fast things happen and the values of those parameters are rather critical when it comes to building a model and so far the modellers have been quite good at describing what they know is the right answer because they knew that to start with. They’ve not been so good, in my view, about saying well you know about this component a, b, c, d, e, f and g, but without factor x it won’t have the behaviour that we know that it does have and it would be very helpful if they came in and said you’re missing the x factor and we said oh my goodness we can go and look for that. Actually that’s not the way it works and in fact, what happens is that the geneticists start having a kind of lucky dip and then some biochemists come along and analyse it and we keep on finding the various components, the key components of these systems completely by luck, well not completely by luck, but I mean going and looking for them, never by predicting sort of …
Leland Hartwell: I think we ought to look at history here. For example take gene regulation. This is an area where it might have been simple in Paul’s terms where it makes good sense to control a gene by turning on or off its message. But in fact, nature has used every single step of information transformation from turning on the gene, from getting the message part way started, the stopping it, from once it’s made degrading it, from starting the translation of a protein. You could every single step of information transfer from the gene to the protein and the activity of the programme is utilised by itself.
Tim Hunt: If you conceive a bit controlled somewhere, it will be controlled somewhere.
Leland Hartwell: Yes, and I have a feeling that that’s the level of complexity we’re going to be faced with and everything as anything that could happen will have been used somewhere.
Sir Paul Nurse: But it may be that it doesn’t matter where it’s regulated, in the sense that one can get an explanation by just understanding that this module if you like, will lead to regulation and it may be that when you’re trying to describe the higher order phenomena you do not need the detailed understanding of exactly where that regulation occurs.";555;Future Research
But given that your optimism is real and you are getting some correct on the system, what would you like to explain by this, what are the really hard questions in bioscience today that you want to get to.;"Sir Paul Nurse: Can I jump in there because there’s a new problem that really is interesting me which is how biological systems generate form, spatial order, because I think this is an interesting issue because, knowing within three-dimensional space, the positions of different objects and components within that is not a trivial problem
Tim Hunt: Theoretical everything should be spherical and they’re not.
Sir Paul Nurse: And that’s what I …
Tim Hunt: /- – -/ was wrong.
Sir Paul Nurse: I’m really fascinated by this because I’m thinking about it in terms of a single cell just because it’s such a simple system to approach. It may be the rules that are important, there are not the same rules that generate the shape of my nose for example, but simply understanding spatial order in any system I think is an interesting challenge.";555;Future Research
Bioscience today is generating a lot of fear, so what is your role in this perspective, what is /- – -/ science;"Tim Hunt: Trying to explain clearly, for example take genetically modified food for example. I just simply don’t understand why this bothers people, but it turned out on interrogation a lot of people don’t realise that with every mouthful of every food whether it’s a plate of fish and chips or a big fat steak they take in billions of DNA molecules. People really thought that only the genetically modified corn contained DNA and that was dangerous somehow, I mean it’s just absurd ignorance on the part of the public.
Leland Hartwell: I think there’s another side to this which is as explores basic discoverers bring back knowledge that illuminates mystery in the world and I think everybody enjoys that. That’s an experience of awe over nature and astronomy is a terrific science in a sense because it is almost all that level of appreciation, but the other aspect that scientific knowledge brings in is the possibility to apply it in some way. It’s the application phase, particularly with respective biology and medicine and human life that fear is created and I think we are all afraid. For example just the transition from being not knowing what the sex of a child was until it’s born to being able to determine at an early stage and decide whether or not you want a child of that sex, that really changes human culture and make life in a very profound way.";555;Motivation
Paul Nurse, in this debate on science and society there has been much talk about public understanding of science but maybe there is a reverse of that question, science understanding of public, do you think that is crucial?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think there is a bridge that we have to construct between scientists and society and it has two sides to that bridge and one is the public understanding, the point Tim emphasised, we have to explain these things so that society has a proper sense. Quite often, just to expand on that briefly, quite often the real debates are not actually about science but they’re about politics and in fact the GM foods debate is as much to do with large corporations controlling the crops and having economic control over issues as much as the gene transfer issue and it all gets mixed together and that’s why it creates so much fire and I think we …
Tim Hunt: It’s sort of eased a demonise some giant corporation …
Sir Paul Nurse: We need to separate those debates so that there’s a clear scientific issue and a political one because you may find people are on one side of that debate with one issue and on the other with the other. But back to this bridge between science and society, I think there it is also important for the scientists to be listening to the public and to be aware of what their issues are and to be aware of the sorts of questions they want answered and the sorts of approaches that should be taken. Sometimes we may get divorced from what the ordinary person or the politician’s thinking, and that I think is truly potentially dangerous because we can become a priesthood and separate it off as some sort of witch doctor class and I think that is a real danger for us.
Tim Hunt: It’s so important that the public should really trust us as far as we’re trustworthy, otherwise everything will break down.";555;Creativity
But somehow you are advisors to the companies and some of you work inside the companies, and you are funded by money from the company. How do you look upon your credibility when it comes to funding in this respect.;"Sir Paul Nurse: This is another huge area of course.
About ten minutes left.
Sir Paul Nurse: This is a huge area about funding and accountability and these issues. I think that there are a number of misconceptions and I think that often many of the general public think that many scientists are funded simply by private capital and they have this sense that we’re in the pockets of a big industry. That is very often not the case. We have received most of our support from Government funded work, mostly at the front end of work which is available to everybody and indeed one of the nice aspects of science is making that information, that knowledge available for all the societies in the world to make use of, so I think we do have a role here in explaining how work is funded and our accountability within that.
Leland Hartwell: But there also is a conflict of interest thing that we need to be very cautious of and within our Institutions we have rules for dealing with conflict of interest, for example if you have an interest in a company, you cannot be involved in clinical trials in a direct way that are testing products that you have a financial interest in and when we make pronouncements to the public about some area of knowledge if we have a financial interest in it we should disclose that.";555;Environment
I mean have an interest in thing is not only financial interest. Today I think almost every research is interest driven, you have strategic interests, you have environmental interests, you have commercial interests, you have carrier interests, so what about the credibility of a scientist when they are all driven by interests.;Leland Hartwell: Everybody’s driven by interests. If you don’t limit it to a financial conflict of interest, then of course we’re all interested in all sorts of /- – -/.;555;Advice  for young scientists
Why do we always distrust the science that are commercial driven interests and not suspicious about the idealistic interests?;"Leland Hartwell: I don’t distrust scientists who have a commercial interest, I just want to know what their biases are, I want to know, that’s all.
Tim Hunt: There’s no reason to distrust companies. After all drug companies, the best thing you can do is produce a highly successful drug and the more people it cures the better, so I must say I think their interests and the public interests are one in the same. Where it comes bad is if they try and foist some imperfect product and exaggerate it’s properties, that’s a different matter.
Sir Paul Nurse: But you touch upon something which is not quite what you were getting at, but I’d like to draw attention to, which is actually a problem to do with managing good science, because in fact good science is carried out by creative individuals working within the scientific society because it’s very socially interactive but still with lots of freedom to follow their own ideas. Then sitting on top of that is some sort of scientific management that provides money and support which has certain strategic objectives and because we’re not paid as scientists simply to play in our laboratories, we like to think that we are, but in fact society supports us and we’re very expensive to support, because they expect something back. They expect something to increase the health or wealth of the nation and balancing this is actually a very difficult task and I don’t think anybody gets it quite right and it’s very very difficult to explain that to our political masters who would really be much happier sometimes with a very heavy strong strategic top /- – -/.
Tim Hunt: They would love to be able to say just solve this problem. In Britain for example BSE is a problem, we really don’t know whether sheep have it, we really don’t know whether humans eating this stuff are going to get it and they would love to be able to direct scientists to solve these problems and the trouble is that people like us are really not very good at behaving under those circumstances.
Leland Hartwell: There are a full range of possibilities though. It’s ok to have to fund areas of strategic direction that where you want problems solved and at that point they almost become engineering problems but if you don’t have a foundation of undirected investigation, it’s going to draw you up.";555;Environment
But given the path, the experience of the path of science you know that when you’re looking for one thing you always pop up with something else, so those who are going to finance you with a specific goal will probably find themselves financing some totally different knowledge not that they really knew they were looking for.;"Sir Paul Nurse: That’s certainly the case, but there is, you know, science is a complex activity and there are roles of different sorts of people at different stages in that process. At the front end you need the explorers, a little later the explorers are no good at turning into practical benefit some of those, or not necessarily good at it.
Tim Hunt: And explorers maybe very good exploring mountains but rotten at the seabed.
Leland Hartwell: In one place you see this happening is in start-up companies. Very often start-up company starts up with a very specific idea and they get venture capital to go out and six months later they’re doing something entirely different because the first idea didn’t work and they’ve still got to be profitable and that’s an arena in which you see a lot of shifting around.";555;Advice  for young scientists
But that turns us into what might be the gist of science, the serendipity I mean you are always seeking for something else what you really found. What is the role of serendipity in science?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I’ll kick off with this but I think we’ve all had our own experiences. I think that serendipity does play an important role but in a very particular context. We’re biologists, we’re trying to understand nature and we have to pay real attention to what nature gives us. If we try and impose too much our own thoughts on such complex system, we will either miss things or simply try and force it into a box that is not good for it. I think you have to be very aware of all the possibilities, you have to be very observant and then you can pick up on the serendipitous event, which has certainly happened to me on many occasions in my career and the way I like to think of it, is that nature is giving us the clue that we try and follow.
Leland Hartwell: I think there are actually two forms of approaches to science, both of which lend themselves to serendipity. One is Tim’s example which maybe he can amplify, where all of a sudden nature presents you with some observations say, My gosh that’s interesting, I wasn’t looking for that, let’s see what’s there. The other is more /- – -/ approach where we knew what we looking for, but we didn’t know quite how to find it and all of a sudden something popped up that said, Look over here and you might find what you’re looking for.
Tim Hunt: In my case it really was complete serendipity and I was really studying one problem but interestingly in a system where actually cell division was very much a part of the system, that’s what it was specialised for, but that aspect of it was just fun for me. It was fun to look at these things down a microscope, I never seriously thought I would make any advance, it was much too difficult a problem. Then suddenly I saw this protein go away and because I’d been sort of half thinking about the nature of the problem, worrying about things, it immediately announced to me what was going on. It was something that nobody for a century had even sort of remotely considered possible but once you see it, bang, it’s obvious. Then you go chasing after it because it leads you in that direction. But nobody would ever have even gone looking for the damn thing in the first place because, precisely, because theoretical biology hadn’t said we should be looking for this so, when nature sort of presents itself to you on a plate then you’re …
The secret is to really be open minded …
Tim Hunt: You’ve got to be terribly open minded and have …
… to the unexpected.
Tim Hunt: Yes, absolutely, and all my career I’ve had things like that, you know, suddenly, it’s like walking down the street and seeing something shiny and kneel down and have a look and see whether it’s gold or not.
Let’s finish off then with some really easy questions.
Sir Paul Nurse: I suspect not.";555;Roles of Science (Scientists)
It seems as if bioscience is getting into realms that before has been totally occupied by philosophers and theologians. We’re starting to ask those questions about when does a human become human and when do we finish being human. Take for example this stem cell debate and the debate of embryology. How do you look on your own science when you were really going into this field that raises so many existential questions?;"Sir Paul Nurse: First of all you’re right, and this is why biomedical research is now becoming increasingly contentious because we now are addressing really critical problems about the nature of a human being, about the nature of identity when a human being begins and finishes, and this moves us really into the realm of religious thoughts and brings in fact scientists increasingly into a challenging position with well established religious thoughts. Not unlike I would suggest, the Copernican revolution in the 16th century with physics and the heliocentric, the sun centred world, and I have a feeling that biology and biomedicine is really going to take us into that realm which is one reason why I think this two way process of listening to the society and listening to what really bothers people is so important so that we can make a better go at this transition in the brave new world than maybe happened with astronomy and physics in the 16th century.
With the big difference that there is no death sentence for scientists these days.
Tim Hunt: I find these kind of ethical issues very difficult to deal with and I’m not really used to thinking about them, and I’m not even particularly well informed on the details for example of the stem cell debate which I’ve been asked about a lot. I myself don’t think there’s much wrong with it, I have to say, after all you know things like blood transfusions have been going on for a very long time, that doesn’t seem to bother anybody. I’m slightly confused, I don’t really understand, maybe again it’s a case of what Paul said I should be listening more to the public and finding out what’s really bothering them at the bottom because, scientifically, it seems to be only a good thing. If your leg drops off and you can make a new one from stem cells – who could possibly say that was a bad thing, I just don’t … am I missing something?
Leland Hartwell: It’s a moving target, I feel like the ethics and religious and things come up around areas of mystery where we try to develop some concepts about what’s going on and as knowledge accumulates and enlightens these areas, the sort of ethical questions have to move with them and that’s sort of hard. It’s always a difficult transition and as I look forward, one of the things that I see that looks scary to me, I don’t think I’ll live to see it, is the sort of combination of much more integration of machines with people. Now we wear glasses for example to correct eyesight, I don’t think it will be long before we have all sorts of little computer chips in us and you know …
Tim Hunt: Yes, you can get false ears that really say work like ears if you are deaf …
Leland Hartwell: … and that sort of bothers me you know, it’s going to happen, it’s inevitable.
Tim Hunt: Yes, and completely synthetic hearts.";555;Creativity
Finally, many people are really getting scared about what is going to happen. One of the questions thar raises is when you really have managed to find the mechanisms of life, we feel, many of us, that life is also going to be instrumentalised as you decrease the respect for life. What is going on in your own mind when you see the details on how intricate the system is in biology. Are you getting more or less a miracle when you’re looking at it?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think the more you understand about this beautiful thing we call life the more wonderful it is. Again, it’s easier to look to history because it’s less contentious. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection was such a beautiful idea that you could still have a sense of god who created such a beautiful process and still see it as a wonderful solution to that particular problem. I think if we look at today’s new understanding you can have nothing but a great sense of wonder that comes with that, I think it deepens, in a sense a spiritual understanding beyond simply ignorance and total mystery.
Leland Hartwell: I agree in a little bit difference sense. I don’t think we really ever understand anything. I think we only describe it. That we look and look at greater detail and we develop words and concepts to describe it and we’re all just describing the beauty of nature and it doesn’t become any less beautiful just because we describe it.
Tim Hunt: Yes exactly, as you walk through a forest, knowing what the trees are growing it doesn’t make it any less the more beautiful forest exactly as Lee says. Inside the cell you find almost every day more wonderful things and say, Oh, that’s how it works, it’s beautiful it’s really beautiful.";555;Future research
But is it true you are the royalties is of a scientific community for one year now or for the rest of your life?;"Leland Hartwell: Certainly feel it during this celebration here.
Sir Paul Nurse: But of course, science moves on so in fact the Kings get changed very quickly.";556;Creativity
Oh yes, those days, no scientist is happier as the one which can prove that the professor was wrong.;"Sir Paul Nurse: Correct. That’s one of the beauties of science that it does move on and there isn’t a received wisdom that just stays in one place with one person.
Tim Hunt: But at the same time there were giants present here, this week, I’m thinking people like Jim Watson, I’m thinking of people like François Jacob, thinking of people like Günter Blobel, they haven’t been disapproved, they put a new big step on our constant stairway of knowledge.";556;Creativity
But does that mean that science actually really is coming closer and closer to reality? There are some truths that remain truths even throughout the centuries.;"Sir Paul Nurse: This is quite complex philosophically because we tend to work in certain paradigms and for a while in fact we put these bricks in the wall as Tim was alluding to within that paradigm, but then you can get a real shift which takes you into a sort of different area altogether. That’s certainly been the case in physics at the beginning of the last century with quantum mechanics and relativity there was a real shift from Newtonian paradigms of the previous two and a half centuries. In biology it’s sometimes a little bit more difficult to see that.
Tim Hunt: That’s really happened in biology, you know, the establishment of the cell theory and then Pasteur proves that there’s no such thing as spontaneous creation, these are sort of universal truths.";556;Creativity
But what differentiation that everyone thought that higher animals could never be cloned and then all of a sudden there’s a Dolly. Isn’t that a major shift in how you perceived DNA?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think that not sure so much in the sense that was a technical achievement but it had been achieved with frogs actually that particular …
But not with high animals.
Leland Hartwell: Frogs are very high animals …
Tim Hunt: The frog is a high animal. What do you mean, were you trying to despise the poor frog?
Sir Paul Nurse: You’re talking to a …
Tim Hunt: You’re talking to the wrong people of course, we love frogs. They are called low organisms, but we love them.
Sir Paul Nurse: You’re talking to a CO and two /- – -/ here and frogs are something up there, very complex to us.
Leland Hartwell: But in terms of paradigms we are in an era now, from about the last 30 or 40 years, where we are sort of enumerating the molecular pieces, we’re making catalogues of who the players are in different processes and we’re already beginning to see the end of that era and a new era of you know, what are the properties of assemblies and modules and circuits of these groups.
Tim Hunt: Emergent properties ensemble of all of those subunits, sorry sub-assemblies.";556;Meaning(Values) of Work
But anyway, if you excuse me, in one way you have solved the easy problem and now you come to the real difficult problem.;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think Lee, I mean this is why I was referring to paradigm shifts with physics which is clear, because I have a feeling there will be a paradigm shift in biology. I like to think of it a little bit like this a metaphor is that we’ve been identifying the actors in a play and we now have to write the script, and we’ve been identifying a lot of the molecules, the elements but actually putting it all together is in the symphony analogy or the play analogy requires maybe different sorts of thinking I actually am beginning to wonder.
Leland Hartwell: What’s easy and what’s hard depends on the era, I think when we began our careers and were interested in dissecting some of the complexity of cell biology that was considered very mysterious and difficult and impossible but we’re moving beyond that era now and now people see that as relatively straight forward but how all things work together now appears to be a big mystery.
Tim Hunt: I think one of the curious things … I mean I never really seriously thought in my lifetime to see so much progress and developmental biology. I think Eric Wieschaus and Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard – this was extraordinary what they did – that was one of my favourite prizes of recent years actually, because the deep deep mystery and suddenly it’s all plain.";556;Creativity
But nevertheless do you think there is need for a total new concept? Because you made a wonderful metaphor at your banquet speech about the cell being a symphony orchestra. You could maybe add that life was the music and you could have included the audience and even if you can analyse the conductor, could you then explain the symphony orchestra by looking at the details?;"Leland Hartwell: I think that’s a metaphor of the transition that’s taking place is that as we learn more and more of the individual musicians, if you will, and what it is that they do as individuals we don’t yet understand how the whole assembly creates something that is as beautiful and mysterious as a cell dividing or just a cell metabolising or any of the wonderful things that cells do. That’s the era that I think most biologists, molecular biologists would say we’re moving into now, is how does the properties emerge.
Tim Hunt: It’s becoming much more … I’m so pleased that we have a prize for physiology because I think that’s exactly where we’re going, it’s molecular physiology from now on by which I mean that how things work together, right. It’s all very well having … we’ve sort of come out of a chemical phase almost and I think we’re entering a real physiological phase.";556;Meaning(Values) of Work
But I mean science is per definition reductionistic. How you look at structures, you look at details, and life is time- and spacedependent and dynamics and interactive. You have looked at frozen moments of details, can you ever understand system …;"Tim Hunt: Oh sure, look at the way that muscles and nerves work for example, was done a long time ago. It’s funny, sometimes things are done from the top down and sometimes done from the bottom up.
Sir Paul Nurse: I often think too much is made of this reductionism holism difference. Of course science has to explain in terms of basic components or elements or sub systems but nearly all of us working at a holistic framework looking at the overall system. The challenge we have now is in particularly in the life sciences is that these systems are actually quite complicated, in fact very complicated and unlike for example in chemistry and physics where you have lots of objects behaving identically like atoms, what we have is lots of objects which don’t behave identically
Tim Hunt: Which interact and each feedback positively and negatively with each other. It’s very complicated and the trick of doing successful science is from isolating the simplicity out of that complexity otherwise you’re lost. It’s all very well to look at a dividing cell and going, ‘Gosh, this is marvellous’! but it doesn’t help you understand what’s going on behind the scenes.
Sir Paul Nurse: I think that’s absolutely right, but now we’ve got to start thinking. We have all this individual components, behaving in different ways, interact in different ways and we’ve got to somehow extract the general principles from that behaviour and try and get … You can use these words like emerge and properties or whatever, they often raise more heat than light when you use these terms, it must be said, but I think there is a challenge there and describing the dynamics of this in real space and real time. which we’re just beginning to do in cell biology. I think a brave new world is going to come from this, I’m an optimist I must say, but I think that it’s very exciting times.
Leland Hartwell: I think there’s another thing too to say about reductionism is that you take some global property and you try to explain it at the next level down and the next level down may just be cell society. We’re now very concentrated on the molecular level but as we start asking how cells behave the right description may not be in molecules, the right description may be in circuits or modules or certain properties, so creating the right concepts to go the next level down is sort of the nature of reductionism and the creative part.";556;Meaning(Values) of Work
Which means that you can find some very precise detail in hierarchy that is really governing the next level;"Tim Hunt: Yes, the clue to the whole thing.
Sir Paul Nurse: I think there’s two ways actually to answer that: One is, which is perhaps what we’ve done, which is to focus on certain components and elements which are crucial and critical and I think that that falls naturally out of our analysis. I think a second way of viewing this, which I think is what Lee was hinting at, is could we describe general properties of these systems, are there rules that would govern general properties which don’t require going down to specific behaviours of individual components but when in a certain assemblage give rise to behaviours that are interesting. I think that’s perhaps what you were getting at.
Leland Hartwell: Exactly, we have our signalling system, cells respond to signals for example and they may respond over a certain concentration range, they may respond by flipping states or by a gradual transition. These are sort of dynamic concepts that don’t necessary require molecular explanation but require some kind of probably creative conceptualisation that may be different than anything we think of right now.
Tim Hunt: I know there’s an economist might describe an economy, sort of abstractable principles.
Leland Hartwell: Exactly, yes";556;Advice for young scientists
Does that also mean that you are looking for inspiration from other areas of science, like scientists who are dealing with the mathematics, the complex system, dealing with the scientists from economy are trying to do mathematics for complex systems.;"Leland Hartwell: Yes, very much. I think one important area that we can learn a lot about molecular circuits from, or from electronic circuits in order to understand a complex circuit, what you’d really like to have is a very detailed description of the input/output characteristics, as you perturb the system how does it respond. We don’t usually have that for many of our biological circuits, we know what the components are but we don’t know how the input/output are related in any quantitative terms.
Sir Paul Nurse: Because I’d like to push that metaphor even further. It may be by knowing the sorts of components that you have and by knowing that they can be connected in certain ways. In fact all the huge variety that is possible may not actually be occurring because it may be that the only linking certain components that behave in certain ways in particular ways that may only generate certain stable operating systems and that we’re not actually faced with immense complexity we’re faced with a few solutions. If we can identify the rules for getting those solutions, we’ll simplify the problem.";556;Motivation
But given that you’re right, what will the implications be? Finding the simple rules that govern complex systems, you said ‘brave new world’, it really sounds something in that direction, Tim?;"Sir Paul Nurse: He’s more sceptical of …
Tim Hunt: I think, it’s very interesting. Paul likes theoretical biology and he has some good friends who are rather good theoretical biologists but my own view is that these approaches so far have not been very successful. Partly because we don’t even know the parts, secondly because it’s very difficult to measure accurately the properties of those parts. There are certain kinetic constants about how fast things happen and the values of those parameters are rather critical when it comes to building a model and so far the modellers have been quite good at describing what they know is the right answer because they knew that to start with. They’ve not been so good, in my view, about saying well you know about this component a, b, c, d, e, f and g, but without factor x it won’t have the behaviour that we know that it does have and it would be very helpful if they came in and said you’re missing the x factor and we said oh my goodness we can go and look for that. Actually that’s not the way it works and in fact, what happens is that the geneticists start having a kind of lucky dip and then some biochemists come along and analyse it and we keep on finding the various components, the key components of these systems completely by luck, well not completely by luck, but I mean going and looking for them, never by predicting sort of …
Leland Hartwell: I think we ought to look at history here. For example take gene regulation. This is an area where it might have been simple in Paul’s terms where it makes good sense to control a gene by turning on or off its message. But in fact, nature has used every single step of information transformation from turning on the gene, from getting the message part way started, the stopping it, from once it’s made degrading it, from starting the translation of a protein. You could every single step of information transfer from the gene to the protein and the activity of the programme is utilised by itself.
Tim Hunt: If you conceive a bit controlled somewhere, it will be controlled somewhere.
Leland Hartwell: Yes, and I have a feeling that that’s the level of complexity we’re going to be faced with and everything as anything that could happen will have been used somewhere.
Sir Paul Nurse: But it may be that it doesn’t matter where it’s regulated, in the sense that one can get an explanation by just understanding that this module if you like, will lead to regulation and it may be that when you’re trying to describe the higher order phenomena you do not need the detailed understanding of exactly where that regulation occurs.";556;Future Research
But given that your optimism is real and you are getting some correct on the system, what would you like to explain by this, what are the really hard questions in bioscience today that you want to get to.;"Sir Paul Nurse: Can I jump in there because there’s a new problem that really is interesting me which is how biological systems generate form, spatial order, because I think this is an interesting issue because, knowing within three-dimensional space, the positions of different objects and components within that is not a trivial problem
Tim Hunt: Theoretical everything should be spherical and they’re not.
Sir Paul Nurse: And that’s what I …
Tim Hunt: /- – -/ was wrong.
Sir Paul Nurse: I’m really fascinated by this because I’m thinking about it in terms of a single cell just because it’s such a simple system to approach. It may be the rules that are important, there are not the same rules that generate the shape of my nose for example, but simply understanding spatial order in any system I think is an interesting challenge.";556;Future Research
Bioscience today is generating a lot of fear, so what is your role in this perspective, what is /- – -/ science;"Tim Hunt: Trying to explain clearly, for example take genetically modified food for example. I just simply don’t understand why this bothers people, but it turned out on interrogation a lot of people don’t realise that with every mouthful of every food whether it’s a plate of fish and chips or a big fat steak they take in billions of DNA molecules. People really thought that only the genetically modified corn contained DNA and that was dangerous somehow, I mean it’s just absurd ignorance on the part of the public.
Leland Hartwell: I think there’s another side to this which is as explores basic discoverers bring back knowledge that illuminates mystery in the world and I think everybody enjoys that. That’s an experience of awe over nature and astronomy is a terrific science in a sense because it is almost all that level of appreciation, but the other aspect that scientific knowledge brings in is the possibility to apply it in some way. It’s the application phase, particularly with respective biology and medicine and human life that fear is created and I think we are all afraid. For example just the transition from being not knowing what the sex of a child was until it’s born to being able to determine at an early stage and decide whether or not you want a child of that sex, that really changes human culture and make life in a very profound way.";556;Motivation
Paul Nurse, in this debate on science and society there has been much talk about public understanding of science but maybe there is a reverse of that question, science understanding of public, do you think that is crucial?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think there is a bridge that we have to construct between scientists and society and it has two sides to that bridge and one is the public understanding, the point Tim emphasised, we have to explain these things so that society has a proper sense. Quite often, just to expand on that briefly, quite often the real debates are not actually about science but they’re about politics and in fact the GM foods debate is as much to do with large corporations controlling the crops and having economic control over issues as much as the gene transfer issue and it all gets mixed together and that’s why it creates so much fire and I think we …
Tim Hunt: It’s sort of eased a demonise some giant corporation …
Sir Paul Nurse: We need to separate those debates so that there’s a clear scientific issue and a political one because you may find people are on one side of that debate with one issue and on the other with the other. But back to this bridge between science and society, I think there it is also important for the scientists to be listening to the public and to be aware of what their issues are and to be aware of the sorts of questions they want answered and the sorts of approaches that should be taken. Sometimes we may get divorced from what the ordinary person or the politician’s thinking, and that I think is truly potentially dangerous because we can become a priesthood and separate it off as some sort of witch doctor class and I think that is a real danger for us.
Tim Hunt: It’s so important that the public should really trust us as far as we’re trustworthy, otherwise everything will break down.";556;Creativity
But somehow you are advisors to the companies and some of you work inside the companies, and you are funded by money from the company. How do you look upon your credibility when it comes to funding in this respect.;"Sir Paul Nurse: This is another huge area of course.
About ten minutes left.
Sir Paul Nurse: This is a huge area about funding and accountability and these issues. I think that there are a number of misconceptions and I think that often many of the general public think that many scientists are funded simply by private capital and they have this sense that we’re in the pockets of a big industry. That is very often not the case. We have received most of our support from Government funded work, mostly at the front end of work which is available to everybody and indeed one of the nice aspects of science is making that information, that knowledge available for all the societies in the world to make use of, so I think we do have a role here in explaining how work is funded and our accountability within that.
Leland Hartwell: But there also is a conflict of interest thing that we need to be very cautious of and within our Institutions we have rules for dealing with conflict of interest, for example if you have an interest in a company, you cannot be involved in clinical trials in a direct way that are testing products that you have a financial interest in and when we make pronouncements to the public about some area of knowledge if we have a financial interest in it we should disclose that.";556;Environment
I mean have an interest in thing is not only financial interest. Today I think almost every research is interest driven, you have strategic interests, you have environmental interests, you have commercial interests, you have carrier interests, so what about the credibility of a scientist when they are all driven by interests.;Leland Hartwell: Everybody’s driven by interests. If you don’t limit it to a financial conflict of interest, then of course we’re all interested in all sorts of /- – -/.;556;Advice  for young scientists
Why do we always distrust the science that are commercial driven interests and not suspicious about the idealistic interests?;"Leland Hartwell: I don’t distrust scientists who have a commercial interest, I just want to know what their biases are, I want to know, that’s all.
Tim Hunt: There’s no reason to distrust companies. After all drug companies, the best thing you can do is produce a highly successful drug and the more people it cures the better, so I must say I think their interests and the public interests are one in the same. Where it comes bad is if they try and foist some imperfect product and exaggerate it’s properties, that’s a different matter.
Sir Paul Nurse: But you touch upon something which is not quite what you were getting at, but I’d like to draw attention to, which is actually a problem to do with managing good science, because in fact good science is carried out by creative individuals working within the scientific society because it’s very socially interactive but still with lots of freedom to follow their own ideas. Then sitting on top of that is some sort of scientific management that provides money and support which has certain strategic objectives and because we’re not paid as scientists simply to play in our laboratories, we like to think that we are, but in fact society supports us and we’re very expensive to support, because they expect something back. They expect something to increase the health or wealth of the nation and balancing this is actually a very difficult task and I don’t think anybody gets it quite right and it’s very very difficult to explain that to our political masters who would really be much happier sometimes with a very heavy strong strategic top /- – -/.
Tim Hunt: They would love to be able to say just solve this problem. In Britain for example BSE is a problem, we really don’t know whether sheep have it, we really don’t know whether humans eating this stuff are going to get it and they would love to be able to direct scientists to solve these problems and the trouble is that people like us are really not very good at behaving under those circumstances.
Leland Hartwell: There are a full range of possibilities though. It’s ok to have to fund areas of strategic direction that where you want problems solved and at that point they almost become engineering problems but if you don’t have a foundation of undirected investigation, it’s going to draw you up.";556;Environment
But given the path, the experience of the path of science you know that when you’re looking for one thing you always pop up with something else, so those who are going to finance you with a specific goal will probably find themselves financing some totally different knowledge not that they really knew they were looking for.;"Sir Paul Nurse: That’s certainly the case, but there is, you know, science is a complex activity and there are roles of different sorts of people at different stages in that process. At the front end you need the explorers, a little later the explorers are no good at turning into practical benefit some of those, or not necessarily good at it.
Tim Hunt: And explorers maybe very good exploring mountains but rotten at the seabed.
Leland Hartwell: In one place you see this happening is in start-up companies. Very often start-up company starts up with a very specific idea and they get venture capital to go out and six months later they’re doing something entirely different because the first idea didn’t work and they’ve still got to be profitable and that’s an arena in which you see a lot of shifting around.";556;Advice  for young scientists
But that turns us into what might be the gist of science, the serendipity I mean you are always seeking for something else what you really found. What is the role of serendipity in science?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I’ll kick off with this but I think we’ve all had our own experiences. I think that serendipity does play an important role but in a very particular context. We’re biologists, we’re trying to understand nature and we have to pay real attention to what nature gives us. If we try and impose too much our own thoughts on such complex system, we will either miss things or simply try and force it into a box that is not good for it. I think you have to be very aware of all the possibilities, you have to be very observant and then you can pick up on the serendipitous event, which has certainly happened to me on many occasions in my career and the way I like to think of it, is that nature is giving us the clue that we try and follow.
Leland Hartwell: I think there are actually two forms of approaches to science, both of which lend themselves to serendipity. One is Tim’s example which maybe he can amplify, where all of a sudden nature presents you with some observations say, My gosh that’s interesting, I wasn’t looking for that, let’s see what’s there. The other is more /- – -/ approach where we knew what we looking for, but we didn’t know quite how to find it and all of a sudden something popped up that said, Look over here and you might find what you’re looking for.
Tim Hunt: In my case it really was complete serendipity and I was really studying one problem but interestingly in a system where actually cell division was very much a part of the system, that’s what it was specialised for, but that aspect of it was just fun for me. It was fun to look at these things down a microscope, I never seriously thought I would make any advance, it was much too difficult a problem. Then suddenly I saw this protein go away and because I’d been sort of half thinking about the nature of the problem, worrying about things, it immediately announced to me what was going on. It was something that nobody for a century had even sort of remotely considered possible but once you see it, bang, it’s obvious. Then you go chasing after it because it leads you in that direction. But nobody would ever have even gone looking for the damn thing in the first place because, precisely, because theoretical biology hadn’t said we should be looking for this so, when nature sort of presents itself to you on a plate then you’re …
The secret is to really be open minded …
Tim Hunt: You’ve got to be terribly open minded and have …
… to the unexpected.
Tim Hunt: Yes, absolutely, and all my career I’ve had things like that, you know, suddenly, it’s like walking down the street and seeing something shiny and kneel down and have a look and see whether it’s gold or not.
Let’s finish off then with some really easy questions.
Sir Paul Nurse: I suspect not.";556;Roles of Science (Scientists)
It seems as if bioscience is getting into realms that before has been totally occupied by philosophers and theologians. We’re starting to ask those questions about when does a human become human and when do we finish being human. Take for example this stem cell debate and the debate of embryology. How do you look on your own science when you were really going into this field that raises so many existential questions?;"Sir Paul Nurse: First of all you’re right, and this is why biomedical research is now becoming increasingly contentious because we now are addressing really critical problems about the nature of a human being, about the nature of identity when a human being begins and finishes, and this moves us really into the realm of religious thoughts and brings in fact scientists increasingly into a challenging position with well established religious thoughts. Not unlike I would suggest, the Copernican revolution in the 16th century with physics and the heliocentric, the sun centred world, and I have a feeling that biology and biomedicine is really going to take us into that realm which is one reason why I think this two way process of listening to the society and listening to what really bothers people is so important so that we can make a better go at this transition in the brave new world than maybe happened with astronomy and physics in the 16th century.
With the big difference that there is no death sentence for scientists these days.
Tim Hunt: I find these kind of ethical issues very difficult to deal with and I’m not really used to thinking about them, and I’m not even particularly well informed on the details for example of the stem cell debate which I’ve been asked about a lot. I myself don’t think there’s much wrong with it, I have to say, after all you know things like blood transfusions have been going on for a very long time, that doesn’t seem to bother anybody. I’m slightly confused, I don’t really understand, maybe again it’s a case of what Paul said I should be listening more to the public and finding out what’s really bothering them at the bottom because, scientifically, it seems to be only a good thing. If your leg drops off and you can make a new one from stem cells – who could possibly say that was a bad thing, I just don’t … am I missing something?
Leland Hartwell: It’s a moving target, I feel like the ethics and religious and things come up around areas of mystery where we try to develop some concepts about what’s going on and as knowledge accumulates and enlightens these areas, the sort of ethical questions have to move with them and that’s sort of hard. It’s always a difficult transition and as I look forward, one of the things that I see that looks scary to me, I don’t think I’ll live to see it, is the sort of combination of much more integration of machines with people. Now we wear glasses for example to correct eyesight, I don’t think it will be long before we have all sorts of little computer chips in us and you know …
Tim Hunt: Yes, you can get false ears that really say work like ears if you are deaf …
Leland Hartwell: … and that sort of bothers me you know, it’s going to happen, it’s inevitable.
Tim Hunt: Yes, and completely synthetic hearts.";556;Creativity
Finally, many people are really getting scared about what is going to happen. One of the questions thar raises is when you really have managed to find the mechanisms of life, we feel, many of us, that life is also going to be instrumentalised as you decrease the respect for life. What is going on in your own mind when you see the details on how intricate the system is in biology. Are you getting more or less a miracle when you’re looking at it?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think the more you understand about this beautiful thing we call life the more wonderful it is. Again, it’s easier to look to history because it’s less contentious. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection was such a beautiful idea that you could still have a sense of god who created such a beautiful process and still see it as a wonderful solution to that particular problem. I think if we look at today’s new understanding you can have nothing but a great sense of wonder that comes with that, I think it deepens, in a sense a spiritual understanding beyond simply ignorance and total mystery.
Leland Hartwell: I agree in a little bit difference sense. I don’t think we really ever understand anything. I think we only describe it. That we look and look at greater detail and we develop words and concepts to describe it and we’re all just describing the beauty of nature and it doesn’t become any less beautiful just because we describe it.
Tim Hunt: Yes exactly, as you walk through a forest, knowing what the trees are growing it doesn’t make it any less the more beautiful forest exactly as Lee says. Inside the cell you find almost every day more wonderful things and say, Oh, that’s how it works, it’s beautiful it’s really beautiful.";556;Future research
But is it true you are the royalties is of a scientific community for one year now or for the rest of your life?;"Leland Hartwell: Certainly feel it during this celebration here.
Sir Paul Nurse: But of course, science moves on so in fact the Kings get changed very quickly.";557;Creativity
Oh yes, those days, no scientist is happier as the one which can prove that the professor was wrong.;"Sir Paul Nurse: Correct. That’s one of the beauties of science that it does move on and there isn’t a received wisdom that just stays in one place with one person.
Tim Hunt: But at the same time there were giants present here, this week, I’m thinking people like Jim Watson, I’m thinking of people like François Jacob, thinking of people like Günter Blobel, they haven’t been disapproved, they put a new big step on our constant stairway of knowledge.";557;Creativity
But does that mean that science actually really is coming closer and closer to reality? There are some truths that remain truths even throughout the centuries.;"Sir Paul Nurse: This is quite complex philosophically because we tend to work in certain paradigms and for a while in fact we put these bricks in the wall as Tim was alluding to within that paradigm, but then you can get a real shift which takes you into a sort of different area altogether. That’s certainly been the case in physics at the beginning of the last century with quantum mechanics and relativity there was a real shift from Newtonian paradigms of the previous two and a half centuries. In biology it’s sometimes a little bit more difficult to see that.
Tim Hunt: That’s really happened in biology, you know, the establishment of the cell theory and then Pasteur proves that there’s no such thing as spontaneous creation, these are sort of universal truths.";557;Creativity
But what differentiation that everyone thought that higher animals could never be cloned and then all of a sudden there’s a Dolly. Isn’t that a major shift in how you perceived DNA?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think that not sure so much in the sense that was a technical achievement but it had been achieved with frogs actually that particular …
But not with high animals.
Leland Hartwell: Frogs are very high animals …
Tim Hunt: The frog is a high animal. What do you mean, were you trying to despise the poor frog?
Sir Paul Nurse: You’re talking to a …
Tim Hunt: You’re talking to the wrong people of course, we love frogs. They are called low organisms, but we love them.
Sir Paul Nurse: You’re talking to a CO and two /- – -/ here and frogs are something up there, very complex to us.
Leland Hartwell: But in terms of paradigms we are in an era now, from about the last 30 or 40 years, where we are sort of enumerating the molecular pieces, we’re making catalogues of who the players are in different processes and we’re already beginning to see the end of that era and a new era of you know, what are the properties of assemblies and modules and circuits of these groups.
Tim Hunt: Emergent properties ensemble of all of those subunits, sorry sub-assemblies.";557;Meaning(Values) of Work
But anyway, if you excuse me, in one way you have solved the easy problem and now you come to the real difficult problem.;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think Lee, I mean this is why I was referring to paradigm shifts with physics which is clear, because I have a feeling there will be a paradigm shift in biology. I like to think of it a little bit like this a metaphor is that we’ve been identifying the actors in a play and we now have to write the script, and we’ve been identifying a lot of the molecules, the elements but actually putting it all together is in the symphony analogy or the play analogy requires maybe different sorts of thinking I actually am beginning to wonder.
Leland Hartwell: What’s easy and what’s hard depends on the era, I think when we began our careers and were interested in dissecting some of the complexity of cell biology that was considered very mysterious and difficult and impossible but we’re moving beyond that era now and now people see that as relatively straight forward but how all things work together now appears to be a big mystery.
Tim Hunt: I think one of the curious things … I mean I never really seriously thought in my lifetime to see so much progress and developmental biology. I think Eric Wieschaus and Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard – this was extraordinary what they did – that was one of my favourite prizes of recent years actually, because the deep deep mystery and suddenly it’s all plain.";557;Creativity
But nevertheless do you think there is need for a total new concept? Because you made a wonderful metaphor at your banquet speech about the cell being a symphony orchestra. You could maybe add that life was the music and you could have included the audience and even if you can analyse the conductor, could you then explain the symphony orchestra by looking at the details?;"Leland Hartwell: I think that’s a metaphor of the transition that’s taking place is that as we learn more and more of the individual musicians, if you will, and what it is that they do as individuals we don’t yet understand how the whole assembly creates something that is as beautiful and mysterious as a cell dividing or just a cell metabolising or any of the wonderful things that cells do. That’s the era that I think most biologists, molecular biologists would say we’re moving into now, is how does the properties emerge.
Tim Hunt: It’s becoming much more … I’m so pleased that we have a prize for physiology because I think that’s exactly where we’re going, it’s molecular physiology from now on by which I mean that how things work together, right. It’s all very well having … we’ve sort of come out of a chemical phase almost and I think we’re entering a real physiological phase.";557;Meaning(Values) of Work
But I mean science is per definition reductionistic. How you look at structures, you look at details, and life is time- and spacedependent and dynamics and interactive. You have looked at frozen moments of details, can you ever understand system …;"Tim Hunt: Oh sure, look at the way that muscles and nerves work for example, was done a long time ago. It’s funny, sometimes things are done from the top down and sometimes done from the bottom up.
Sir Paul Nurse: I often think too much is made of this reductionism holism difference. Of course science has to explain in terms of basic components or elements or sub systems but nearly all of us working at a holistic framework looking at the overall system. The challenge we have now is in particularly in the life sciences is that these systems are actually quite complicated, in fact very complicated and unlike for example in chemistry and physics where you have lots of objects behaving identically like atoms, what we have is lots of objects which don’t behave identically
Tim Hunt: Which interact and each feedback positively and negatively with each other. It’s very complicated and the trick of doing successful science is from isolating the simplicity out of that complexity otherwise you’re lost. It’s all very well to look at a dividing cell and going, ‘Gosh, this is marvellous’! but it doesn’t help you understand what’s going on behind the scenes.
Sir Paul Nurse: I think that’s absolutely right, but now we’ve got to start thinking. We have all this individual components, behaving in different ways, interact in different ways and we’ve got to somehow extract the general principles from that behaviour and try and get … You can use these words like emerge and properties or whatever, they often raise more heat than light when you use these terms, it must be said, but I think there is a challenge there and describing the dynamics of this in real space and real time. which we’re just beginning to do in cell biology. I think a brave new world is going to come from this, I’m an optimist I must say, but I think that it’s very exciting times.
Leland Hartwell: I think there’s another thing too to say about reductionism is that you take some global property and you try to explain it at the next level down and the next level down may just be cell society. We’re now very concentrated on the molecular level but as we start asking how cells behave the right description may not be in molecules, the right description may be in circuits or modules or certain properties, so creating the right concepts to go the next level down is sort of the nature of reductionism and the creative part.";557;Meaning(Values) of Work
Which means that you can find some very precise detail in hierarchy that is really governing the next level;"Tim Hunt: Yes, the clue to the whole thing.
Sir Paul Nurse: I think there’s two ways actually to answer that: One is, which is perhaps what we’ve done, which is to focus on certain components and elements which are crucial and critical and I think that that falls naturally out of our analysis. I think a second way of viewing this, which I think is what Lee was hinting at, is could we describe general properties of these systems, are there rules that would govern general properties which don’t require going down to specific behaviours of individual components but when in a certain assemblage give rise to behaviours that are interesting. I think that’s perhaps what you were getting at.
Leland Hartwell: Exactly, we have our signalling system, cells respond to signals for example and they may respond over a certain concentration range, they may respond by flipping states or by a gradual transition. These are sort of dynamic concepts that don’t necessary require molecular explanation but require some kind of probably creative conceptualisation that may be different than anything we think of right now.
Tim Hunt: I know there’s an economist might describe an economy, sort of abstractable principles.
Leland Hartwell: Exactly, yes";557;Advice for young scientists
Does that also mean that you are looking for inspiration from other areas of science, like scientists who are dealing with the mathematics, the complex system, dealing with the scientists from economy are trying to do mathematics for complex systems.;"Leland Hartwell: Yes, very much. I think one important area that we can learn a lot about molecular circuits from, or from electronic circuits in order to understand a complex circuit, what you’d really like to have is a very detailed description of the input/output characteristics, as you perturb the system how does it respond. We don’t usually have that for many of our biological circuits, we know what the components are but we don’t know how the input/output are related in any quantitative terms.
Sir Paul Nurse: Because I’d like to push that metaphor even further. It may be by knowing the sorts of components that you have and by knowing that they can be connected in certain ways. In fact all the huge variety that is possible may not actually be occurring because it may be that the only linking certain components that behave in certain ways in particular ways that may only generate certain stable operating systems and that we’re not actually faced with immense complexity we’re faced with a few solutions. If we can identify the rules for getting those solutions, we’ll simplify the problem.";557;Motivation
But given that you’re right, what will the implications be? Finding the simple rules that govern complex systems, you said ‘brave new world’, it really sounds something in that direction, Tim?;"Sir Paul Nurse: He’s more sceptical of …
Tim Hunt: I think, it’s very interesting. Paul likes theoretical biology and he has some good friends who are rather good theoretical biologists but my own view is that these approaches so far have not been very successful. Partly because we don’t even know the parts, secondly because it’s very difficult to measure accurately the properties of those parts. There are certain kinetic constants about how fast things happen and the values of those parameters are rather critical when it comes to building a model and so far the modellers have been quite good at describing what they know is the right answer because they knew that to start with. They’ve not been so good, in my view, about saying well you know about this component a, b, c, d, e, f and g, but without factor x it won’t have the behaviour that we know that it does have and it would be very helpful if they came in and said you’re missing the x factor and we said oh my goodness we can go and look for that. Actually that’s not the way it works and in fact, what happens is that the geneticists start having a kind of lucky dip and then some biochemists come along and analyse it and we keep on finding the various components, the key components of these systems completely by luck, well not completely by luck, but I mean going and looking for them, never by predicting sort of …
Leland Hartwell: I think we ought to look at history here. For example take gene regulation. This is an area where it might have been simple in Paul’s terms where it makes good sense to control a gene by turning on or off its message. But in fact, nature has used every single step of information transformation from turning on the gene, from getting the message part way started, the stopping it, from once it’s made degrading it, from starting the translation of a protein. You could every single step of information transfer from the gene to the protein and the activity of the programme is utilised by itself.
Tim Hunt: If you conceive a bit controlled somewhere, it will be controlled somewhere.
Leland Hartwell: Yes, and I have a feeling that that’s the level of complexity we’re going to be faced with and everything as anything that could happen will have been used somewhere.
Sir Paul Nurse: But it may be that it doesn’t matter where it’s regulated, in the sense that one can get an explanation by just understanding that this module if you like, will lead to regulation and it may be that when you’re trying to describe the higher order phenomena you do not need the detailed understanding of exactly where that regulation occurs.";557;Future Research
But given that your optimism is real and you are getting some correct on the system, what would you like to explain by this, what are the really hard questions in bioscience today that you want to get to.;"Sir Paul Nurse: Can I jump in there because there’s a new problem that really is interesting me which is how biological systems generate form, spatial order, because I think this is an interesting issue because, knowing within three-dimensional space, the positions of different objects and components within that is not a trivial problem
Tim Hunt: Theoretical everything should be spherical and they’re not.
Sir Paul Nurse: And that’s what I …
Tim Hunt: /- – -/ was wrong.
Sir Paul Nurse: I’m really fascinated by this because I’m thinking about it in terms of a single cell just because it’s such a simple system to approach. It may be the rules that are important, there are not the same rules that generate the shape of my nose for example, but simply understanding spatial order in any system I think is an interesting challenge.";557;Future Research
Bioscience today is generating a lot of fear, so what is your role in this perspective, what is /- – -/ science;"Tim Hunt: Trying to explain clearly, for example take genetically modified food for example. I just simply don’t understand why this bothers people, but it turned out on interrogation a lot of people don’t realise that with every mouthful of every food whether it’s a plate of fish and chips or a big fat steak they take in billions of DNA molecules. People really thought that only the genetically modified corn contained DNA and that was dangerous somehow, I mean it’s just absurd ignorance on the part of the public.
Leland Hartwell: I think there’s another side to this which is as explores basic discoverers bring back knowledge that illuminates mystery in the world and I think everybody enjoys that. That’s an experience of awe over nature and astronomy is a terrific science in a sense because it is almost all that level of appreciation, but the other aspect that scientific knowledge brings in is the possibility to apply it in some way. It’s the application phase, particularly with respective biology and medicine and human life that fear is created and I think we are all afraid. For example just the transition from being not knowing what the sex of a child was until it’s born to being able to determine at an early stage and decide whether or not you want a child of that sex, that really changes human culture and make life in a very profound way.";557;Motivation
Paul Nurse, in this debate on science and society there has been much talk about public understanding of science but maybe there is a reverse of that question, science understanding of public, do you think that is crucial?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think there is a bridge that we have to construct between scientists and society and it has two sides to that bridge and one is the public understanding, the point Tim emphasised, we have to explain these things so that society has a proper sense. Quite often, just to expand on that briefly, quite often the real debates are not actually about science but they’re about politics and in fact the GM foods debate is as much to do with large corporations controlling the crops and having economic control over issues as much as the gene transfer issue and it all gets mixed together and that’s why it creates so much fire and I think we …
Tim Hunt: It’s sort of eased a demonise some giant corporation …
Sir Paul Nurse: We need to separate those debates so that there’s a clear scientific issue and a political one because you may find people are on one side of that debate with one issue and on the other with the other. But back to this bridge between science and society, I think there it is also important for the scientists to be listening to the public and to be aware of what their issues are and to be aware of the sorts of questions they want answered and the sorts of approaches that should be taken. Sometimes we may get divorced from what the ordinary person or the politician’s thinking, and that I think is truly potentially dangerous because we can become a priesthood and separate it off as some sort of witch doctor class and I think that is a real danger for us.
Tim Hunt: It’s so important that the public should really trust us as far as we’re trustworthy, otherwise everything will break down.";557;Creativity
But somehow you are advisors to the companies and some of you work inside the companies, and you are funded by money from the company. How do you look upon your credibility when it comes to funding in this respect.;"Sir Paul Nurse: This is another huge area of course.
About ten minutes left.
Sir Paul Nurse: This is a huge area about funding and accountability and these issues. I think that there are a number of misconceptions and I think that often many of the general public think that many scientists are funded simply by private capital and they have this sense that we’re in the pockets of a big industry. That is very often not the case. We have received most of our support from Government funded work, mostly at the front end of work which is available to everybody and indeed one of the nice aspects of science is making that information, that knowledge available for all the societies in the world to make use of, so I think we do have a role here in explaining how work is funded and our accountability within that.
Leland Hartwell: But there also is a conflict of interest thing that we need to be very cautious of and within our Institutions we have rules for dealing with conflict of interest, for example if you have an interest in a company, you cannot be involved in clinical trials in a direct way that are testing products that you have a financial interest in and when we make pronouncements to the public about some area of knowledge if we have a financial interest in it we should disclose that.";557;Environment
I mean have an interest in thing is not only financial interest. Today I think almost every research is interest driven, you have strategic interests, you have environmental interests, you have commercial interests, you have carrier interests, so what about the credibility of a scientist when they are all driven by interests.;Leland Hartwell: Everybody’s driven by interests. If you don’t limit it to a financial conflict of interest, then of course we’re all interested in all sorts of /- – -/.;557;Advice  for young scientists
Why do we always distrust the science that are commercial driven interests and not suspicious about the idealistic interests?;"Leland Hartwell: I don’t distrust scientists who have a commercial interest, I just want to know what their biases are, I want to know, that’s all.
Tim Hunt: There’s no reason to distrust companies. After all drug companies, the best thing you can do is produce a highly successful drug and the more people it cures the better, so I must say I think their interests and the public interests are one in the same. Where it comes bad is if they try and foist some imperfect product and exaggerate it’s properties, that’s a different matter.
Sir Paul Nurse: But you touch upon something which is not quite what you were getting at, but I’d like to draw attention to, which is actually a problem to do with managing good science, because in fact good science is carried out by creative individuals working within the scientific society because it’s very socially interactive but still with lots of freedom to follow their own ideas. Then sitting on top of that is some sort of scientific management that provides money and support which has certain strategic objectives and because we’re not paid as scientists simply to play in our laboratories, we like to think that we are, but in fact society supports us and we’re very expensive to support, because they expect something back. They expect something to increase the health or wealth of the nation and balancing this is actually a very difficult task and I don’t think anybody gets it quite right and it’s very very difficult to explain that to our political masters who would really be much happier sometimes with a very heavy strong strategic top /- – -/.
Tim Hunt: They would love to be able to say just solve this problem. In Britain for example BSE is a problem, we really don’t know whether sheep have it, we really don’t know whether humans eating this stuff are going to get it and they would love to be able to direct scientists to solve these problems and the trouble is that people like us are really not very good at behaving under those circumstances.
Leland Hartwell: There are a full range of possibilities though. It’s ok to have to fund areas of strategic direction that where you want problems solved and at that point they almost become engineering problems but if you don’t have a foundation of undirected investigation, it’s going to draw you up.";557;Environment
But given the path, the experience of the path of science you know that when you’re looking for one thing you always pop up with something else, so those who are going to finance you with a specific goal will probably find themselves financing some totally different knowledge not that they really knew they were looking for.;"Sir Paul Nurse: That’s certainly the case, but there is, you know, science is a complex activity and there are roles of different sorts of people at different stages in that process. At the front end you need the explorers, a little later the explorers are no good at turning into practical benefit some of those, or not necessarily good at it.
Tim Hunt: And explorers maybe very good exploring mountains but rotten at the seabed.
Leland Hartwell: In one place you see this happening is in start-up companies. Very often start-up company starts up with a very specific idea and they get venture capital to go out and six months later they’re doing something entirely different because the first idea didn’t work and they’ve still got to be profitable and that’s an arena in which you see a lot of shifting around.";557;Advice  for young scientists
But that turns us into what might be the gist of science, the serendipity I mean you are always seeking for something else what you really found. What is the role of serendipity in science?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I’ll kick off with this but I think we’ve all had our own experiences. I think that serendipity does play an important role but in a very particular context. We’re biologists, we’re trying to understand nature and we have to pay real attention to what nature gives us. If we try and impose too much our own thoughts on such complex system, we will either miss things or simply try and force it into a box that is not good for it. I think you have to be very aware of all the possibilities, you have to be very observant and then you can pick up on the serendipitous event, which has certainly happened to me on many occasions in my career and the way I like to think of it, is that nature is giving us the clue that we try and follow.
Leland Hartwell: I think there are actually two forms of approaches to science, both of which lend themselves to serendipity. One is Tim’s example which maybe he can amplify, where all of a sudden nature presents you with some observations say, My gosh that’s interesting, I wasn’t looking for that, let’s see what’s there. The other is more /- – -/ approach where we knew what we looking for, but we didn’t know quite how to find it and all of a sudden something popped up that said, Look over here and you might find what you’re looking for.
Tim Hunt: In my case it really was complete serendipity and I was really studying one problem but interestingly in a system where actually cell division was very much a part of the system, that’s what it was specialised for, but that aspect of it was just fun for me. It was fun to look at these things down a microscope, I never seriously thought I would make any advance, it was much too difficult a problem. Then suddenly I saw this protein go away and because I’d been sort of half thinking about the nature of the problem, worrying about things, it immediately announced to me what was going on. It was something that nobody for a century had even sort of remotely considered possible but once you see it, bang, it’s obvious. Then you go chasing after it because it leads you in that direction. But nobody would ever have even gone looking for the damn thing in the first place because, precisely, because theoretical biology hadn’t said we should be looking for this so, when nature sort of presents itself to you on a plate then you’re …
The secret is to really be open minded …
Tim Hunt: You’ve got to be terribly open minded and have …
… to the unexpected.
Tim Hunt: Yes, absolutely, and all my career I’ve had things like that, you know, suddenly, it’s like walking down the street and seeing something shiny and kneel down and have a look and see whether it’s gold or not.
Let’s finish off then with some really easy questions.
Sir Paul Nurse: I suspect not.";557;Roles of Science (Scientists)
It seems as if bioscience is getting into realms that before has been totally occupied by philosophers and theologians. We’re starting to ask those questions about when does a human become human and when do we finish being human. Take for example this stem cell debate and the debate of embryology. How do you look on your own science when you were really going into this field that raises so many existential questions?;"Sir Paul Nurse: First of all you’re right, and this is why biomedical research is now becoming increasingly contentious because we now are addressing really critical problems about the nature of a human being, about the nature of identity when a human being begins and finishes, and this moves us really into the realm of religious thoughts and brings in fact scientists increasingly into a challenging position with well established religious thoughts. Not unlike I would suggest, the Copernican revolution in the 16th century with physics and the heliocentric, the sun centred world, and I have a feeling that biology and biomedicine is really going to take us into that realm which is one reason why I think this two way process of listening to the society and listening to what really bothers people is so important so that we can make a better go at this transition in the brave new world than maybe happened with astronomy and physics in the 16th century.
With the big difference that there is no death sentence for scientists these days.
Tim Hunt: I find these kind of ethical issues very difficult to deal with and I’m not really used to thinking about them, and I’m not even particularly well informed on the details for example of the stem cell debate which I’ve been asked about a lot. I myself don’t think there’s much wrong with it, I have to say, after all you know things like blood transfusions have been going on for a very long time, that doesn’t seem to bother anybody. I’m slightly confused, I don’t really understand, maybe again it’s a case of what Paul said I should be listening more to the public and finding out what’s really bothering them at the bottom because, scientifically, it seems to be only a good thing. If your leg drops off and you can make a new one from stem cells – who could possibly say that was a bad thing, I just don’t … am I missing something?
Leland Hartwell: It’s a moving target, I feel like the ethics and religious and things come up around areas of mystery where we try to develop some concepts about what’s going on and as knowledge accumulates and enlightens these areas, the sort of ethical questions have to move with them and that’s sort of hard. It’s always a difficult transition and as I look forward, one of the things that I see that looks scary to me, I don’t think I’ll live to see it, is the sort of combination of much more integration of machines with people. Now we wear glasses for example to correct eyesight, I don’t think it will be long before we have all sorts of little computer chips in us and you know …
Tim Hunt: Yes, you can get false ears that really say work like ears if you are deaf …
Leland Hartwell: … and that sort of bothers me you know, it’s going to happen, it’s inevitable.
Tim Hunt: Yes, and completely synthetic hearts.";557;Creativity
Finally, many people are really getting scared about what is going to happen. One of the questions thar raises is when you really have managed to find the mechanisms of life, we feel, many of us, that life is also going to be instrumentalised as you decrease the respect for life. What is going on in your own mind when you see the details on how intricate the system is in biology. Are you getting more or less a miracle when you’re looking at it?;"Sir Paul Nurse: I think the more you understand about this beautiful thing we call life the more wonderful it is. Again, it’s easier to look to history because it’s less contentious. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection was such a beautiful idea that you could still have a sense of god who created such a beautiful process and still see it as a wonderful solution to that particular problem. I think if we look at today’s new understanding you can have nothing but a great sense of wonder that comes with that, I think it deepens, in a sense a spiritual understanding beyond simply ignorance and total mystery.
Leland Hartwell: I agree in a little bit difference sense. I don’t think we really ever understand anything. I think we only describe it. That we look and look at greater detail and we develop words and concepts to describe it and we’re all just describing the beauty of nature and it doesn’t become any less beautiful just because we describe it.
Tim Hunt: Yes exactly, as you walk through a forest, knowing what the trees are growing it doesn’t make it any less the more beautiful forest exactly as Lee says. Inside the cell you find almost every day more wonderful things and say, Oh, that’s how it works, it’s beautiful it’s really beautiful.";557;Future research
So, there is a little discrepancy between you on this one anyhow. But if I rephrase the question and say, will it ever be possible to understand the mechanisms of mind? What is your answer then?;Arvid Carlsson: To understand there is physiological and physiochemical processes that underlie the mind, that we could perhaps reach. But the actual conversion, how these physical phenomena become consciousness, that is what I think is the real tough thing.;558;Meaning(Values) of Work
But if you understand the mechanisms or the things that are changing, you can see them, you can measure them, then you can influence the whole system.;"Arvid Carlsson: That is very true.
In that way, if my question contains the possibility of interfere with all aspects of mind, your answer is yes.
Arvid Carlsson: Yes.
Paul Greengard?
Paul Greengard: I think that the history of science indicates that one by one various barriers have disappeared in areas that the human race thought were impossible to resolve. And everything seems to be solvable. And I don’t see why an understanding of how we think and what consciousness is wouldn’t be approachable in the same way. I think it’s going to be a very long time till we understand the nature of consciousness, even today with these imaging techniques you can start finding out precisely which type of cells are active when you do this or this type of thinking. It certainly should be possible to do similar imaging and understand when people are awake and asleep and I don’t think it’s a huge step beyond that to understand the nature of consciousness.";558;Meaning(Values) of Work
So you’re only putting more weight to the answer that all the different mechanisms that at the end lead to the consciousness experience, those mechanisms can be known and cleared. Is science limitless?;Paul Greengard: In certain principles such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle I think yes it’s limitless. I didn’t always feel that way, it just seems that if you look what happened in the last 30 years it’s unbelievable what the human mind can achieve.;558;Future research
Eric Kandel, on the mechanisms of mind, of course you would have to answer yes on that question as well.;"Eric R Kandel: I sort of come down more on Paul’s side. First of all, I think one needs to distinguish between mechanisms of mind, which involves all operations related to mental processes, action, thoughts, memory, perception, and consciousness. There’s lots of perception, mental processes going on of which we’re unconscious for example. You’re shaking your head as we talk, you’re probably not completely aware of the fact that you’re engaged in sort of reflexive autonomic movements as you talk. Those are mental processes but they’re not necessarily conscious ones. And we have made very good progress in understanding aspects of perception and motor action and I’m confident we will continue to do that.
The mechanism of consciousness is a fascinating one, and one that is getting a lot of attention. Not necessarily a lot of scientific progress, but a lot of attention. Francis Crick has developed a paradigm for looking at attention and consciousness, saying that one ought to look at a simple version of it, which is selective attention. You know, when I sit in this room, I attend to you but I’m also in the background perceiving pictures on the wall and things like this. But there’s a special effort involved in selectively attending to you, so the difference between perceiving something and the heightened selection that goes on with attention, is something he’s been studying in experimental animals with the help of other people. And there is now pretty good understanding of how a monkey, for example, attends to a visual image compared to just looking at the image without attention. So simple cases of conscious awareness are beginning to be analysable. To what degree consciousness of oneself, the most interesting parts of consciousness, become understood is unclear as yet. I sort of agree with Paul that a lot of problems that seemed insoluble became soluble with time. When there’s no add of time, we haven’t reached the limit by any means. It is conceivable that this problem is so difficult that the human mind may not have the computational power to analyse it, but we are far from reaching that particular barrier.";558;Creativity
But you stick to some of the mechanisms to start with, the one that Arvid Carlsson has discovered is dopamine, and I think there is a fascinating correlation between too little dopamine – then you lose control over your body – and too much dopamine – you lose control over your mind. Is that so Arvid Carlsson?;Arvid Carlsson: As well as the body.;558;Meaning(Values) of Work
But is there some sort of relation between the mind and the body in this respect that is basically the same mechanism that in a way controls the material world and the mental world?;Arvid Carlsson: That’s a very interesting question. Anatomically the wiring that analyse movements and the wiring that analyse mental processes are very similar. The balance between different neurotransmitters involved in either of these two is very similar. And have probably evolved along with each other which, in a way, makes a lot of sense because if one goes ahead of the other you’ll have no use for it. The mind and movement have to evolve in parallel.;558;Future research
And in this system you have discovered the chemical signal substances between the connection between the nerves, and Paul Greengard your discovery is really what is happening inside the cell. How does your discovery relate to how we react and how we are, how we experience the world? Are there any connections that you have thought of?;Paul Greengard: The work that we did elucidates how these chemicals, the neurotransmitters which are the mechanism by which the nerve cells communicate with each other, how they produce their responses in the target cells on which they act.;558;Creativity
And they are related to what sort of mental phenomena?;Paul Greengard: All mental phenomena, memory, consciousness and everything else, is all attributable to the behaviour of nerve cells and what the three of us are doing is trying to understand how one nerve cell communicates with another. It’s through the release of a chemical, a neurotransmitter which activates the second nerve cell and then what happens in the second nerve cell once the neurotransmitter activates it and then how that in turn sends a neurotransmitter to the third nerve cell. What we’re doing at this present level, all three of us, is to understand these biological systems going on, these biochemical molecular systems. Other types of neuroscientists, brain scientists, will take the kind of things that we’re doing and try to relate them to the higher order of behaviour in the nervous system.;558;Creativity
But if Arvid Carlsson has done something in between the synapses where the signals are changing the connections between them, you’re only working with molecules inside the cell and how molecules are changing their shape and their effectiveness, what they do, the proteins we are talking about.;Paul Greengard: What we’ve done is to take these neurotransmitters that Arvid Carlsson had been studying and study exactly how they produce chemical and electrical changes in the nerve cells, working out what those biochemical steps are.;558;Future research
And they are related to memory in what way?;Paul Greengard: That remains to be understood to a large extent. Except Eric Kandel’s work addresses that and maybe he’d like to speak to that.;558;Meaning(Values) of Work
So, memory and changes inside the nerve cells, Eric Kandel. What is the concept or idea?;Eric R Kandel: Let me pick up what Paul Greengard was saying. One way to conceive of the contribution the three of us have made is to think of two sets of processes in the brain – mediating and modulating. That there are vast synoptic connections that are responsible for mediating many of the actions, for example motor actions, sensory perception. But the wonderful thing about the brain is that it can regulate the strength of connections. And my colleagues and I have shown that this occurs during learning, that the strength of connections are not fixed, but that inputs such as serotonergic input or dopaminergic input can modulate the strength of synoptic connections. And it does so by activating processes similar to the kind that Paul Greengard has described. In Aplysia one can show …;558;Meaning(Values) of Work
Aplysia, that is the sea snake that you have been working with?;"Yes, one can show that in fact that a very simple withdrawal reflex, like the withdrawal of a hand from a hot object, can be dramatically amplified by an aversive stimulus. And that amplification involves activation of one of these modular choice systems, the serotonergic system that activates a signalling system within the cell. And activation of that signalling system causes strengthening of the synoptic connection, which is responsible for the enhanced withdrawal.
That means that there is a physical change of the size, so memories are actually made of these changes.
Eric R Kandel: Anatomical changes. That’s right.
This is somewhat exciting that the fast reactions, that is electricity and the somewhat slower …
Eric R Kandel: The fast, and not simply electricity, the faster also chemical transmitters but they act on different receptors.
But long term things are also represented by long term changes.
Eric R Kandel: That’s right.";558;Research
You have all been part of a dramatic shift in paradigm when it comes to looking at the brain because all electrophysiology before and when you entered this stage you changed the picture totally into biochemistry. Arvid Carlsson, why did you choose to go contrary and against everyone else?;Arvid Carlsson: I think it depended to some extent on ignorance. I was not so well read in the field of brain physiology, so I could look at the facts in a simple, straight forward way, whereas those people who were burdened by a lot of knowledge, they had to think in other terms. They were, so to speak, fixed in the dogma. I was outside, just because of my ignorance, I think.;558;Motivation
Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard, what makes someone want to go towards the conventional wisdom of the time?;Paul Greengard: In the case of the study of the brain at the time that Arvid, Eric and I did our work, there were two approaches to understanding brain function. There were physiologists who worked in physiology departments and studied the electrical properties of nerve cells. And there were biochemists working in biochemistry laboratories who took a brain or a liver or a muscle and threw it into a homogeniser and studied the chemicals in the brain. And the two groups did not interact. The people sitting biochemistry were only interested in the biochemistry of the brain. The people doing physiology were only interested in the electrical property of the brain. In one sense we were not going against dogma. There was very little prior art out there. In my own case, my work was guided by the hypothesis that a particular mechanism that had been shown to work in the endocrine system, in which hormone released from one cell activates a target cell, that that system might be analogous to how two nerve cells communicate with each other. And that is through a chemical mechanism, that hypothesis turned out to be correct.;558;Creativity
Eric Kandel, you started off as being a psychoanalyst interested in psychoanalysis and everyone thought that was the gateway to the brain at that time. How come that you didn’t believe it?;Eric R Kandel: I did at the beginning and I still find the psychoanalytic view a rich and nuance view of the mind. I just became disappointed as I continued my medical education with how much empirical evidence there was to support it and how devoid it was in thinking about the brain. I became a little bit interested in the brain and as I got more deeply involved I became fascinated with it. And it struck me that memory is the central question in psychoanalysis. And in the 1950s when I began, the dominant view of the brain was that of Karl Lashley at Harvard, who showed that memory was not localisable. That you could remove many regions of the brain and not interfere with memory. What Lashley did not realise is that animals are very smart and if you remove a part of the brain, for example, let’s just say they’re doing a spatial task, if you remove the visual part of the brain, they will use tactile stimuli to find the way, or smell. They have lots of different strategies they can use. I thought one needed to take an extremely simple animal, an extremely simple reflex, where there would be no question about localizability.;558;Creativity
Excuse me for interrupting, but I got so curious, but this is true that you have all entered a new way of looking at things that were contrary to the conventional views of the time. And still the question I am really curious about is how is your mental set up to want to go against this?;"Eric R Kandel: I think each of the three of us gave a somewhat similar answer, in the sense that we did not think of ourselves as revolutionaries at the barricades. We were working along and we thought that one way of moving in the field was the sound one, it’s almost an intuition that this is the right way to go. It turned out be in opposition to what other people were thinking, but one wants to think in original ways, you try to tackle a problem you think is interesting and approach it in the way that you think is most profound.
Paul Greengard: To amplify what Eric said, it’s not that we were going against conventional wisdom, we were following our own instinct. This must be the way it works. And then more conservative folks would say we were disagreeing with them, but we weren’t, we were just looking at things in a different way.
So in a way it was a very unconscious way of …
Eric R Kandel: That’s right. I think that’s absolutely right.
Paul Greengard: No, I don’t understand what you mean, an unconscious way?
You didn’t really think about going against what was the convention, you just did what you thought was working.
Paul Greengard: It was nothing that they had done was wrong, we were exploring an area that other people hadn’t explored, I would say.
Do you agree Arvid Carlsson?
Arvid Carlsson: No. I was taken by surprise, I must say, when we reported on our data and all the big figures in the field said, no this can’t be true.
Paul Greengard: But that’s true for all three of us.
Arvid Carlsson: I mean, I was right and they were wrong. I mean that is how I experienced it. I wouldn’t like to give them any sort of excuse that we were right, all of us, after all. I don’t agree.
Paul Greengard: Maybe add a certain limited truth, we said, look we think that there are other things going on than what you’ve been studying and there’s all this and this. And then we’d say, yes, there’s all this and this. And then we’d show it and they’d say, no, you’re wrong. We were never saying they were wrong, I don’t think. They were saying we were wrong.
Arvid Carlsson: They were wrong, in my opinion.
Eric R Kandel: I must say that Roy Spencer and I wrote an article in 1968, when we first began to realise that learning could be localised to specific synopses. And we pointed out that Lashley’s view, which was the dominant view, had misled the field.";558;Creativity
But if we look then in the future, this is not the last time where things are going to be turned upside down. Have you seen anything in the current science that indicates that there will be maybe a totally new model coming up of how the brain is working? Maybe adding some fundamental new knowledge to the function of the brain?;"Paul Greengard: It’s exactly what I’m saying. There will be totally new ways of looking that will not necessarily be contradictory to what we did. What we’re doing is eliminating truths just like the people before us had even more eliminating truths, and the next people add on to that. And they’re not going to prove that the work that we did was incorrect, they’re going to show a new dimension.
Eric R Kandel: It’s almost probabilistic in a sense. The views that we have ended up supporting existed before, just to a minor degree, so people had seen in the endocrine system the kinds of things that Paul discovered in the nervous system. Kajal had spoken about the fact that synopsis could be the site of memory storage. But at the time that we were working those views were rare, very few people held that. Most people held the opposing point of view. For example, many people felt that Bernhard Katz and Eccles had described synoptic transmission in the nervous system, it was fast synoptic transmission. So they thought all synoptic transmission in the brain was fast. When Paul and I began to study slow synoptic transmission, they thought there’s something unusual about this and people were initially sceptical that this could be of importance.";558;Future research
But when the two models that has exchanged for each other, the electrophysiological model, the biochemistry model, what do you think about the future, Arvid Carlsson, are there totally new things coming up?;Arvid Carlsson: I guess there will be paradigm shifts in the future. But I think it’s inherent in the definition of dogma that we cannot identify it. As soon as we identify it as a dogma, it’s no more a dogma.;558;Future Research
But before there’s a thunderstorm coming up you can always see a little glimpse of the lightening coming, do you see any glimpse here?;Eric R Kandel: We certainly see that. For example, we thought that the nervous system by the time a child is four or five years old, does not generate any more nerve cells. We thought that the number of nerve cells in the brain are limited – if you lose nerve cells as a result of disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, there’s no way of replenishing those nerve cells from the cells in the brain. There’s now increasing evidence that there is a primitive population of cells that stays around in the brain and they can be the source of additional cells later on. That could be the basis of a new development that would enrich our understanding. So I think that’s a very important development.;558;Research
And what would be the conceptual change of that idea?;Paul Greengard: Right now it’s thought that the brain has very little ability to repair itself. And with these new ideas that’s not the case. I would like to go back and correct something that I said, refer to something Arvid said on this. The people who are our predecessors, what they did was not wrong, their interpretation was wrong. For example, in his case, they said no, this molecule dopamine cannot be a neurotransmitter, so in that sense they were wrong. The experimental work they had done was correct, their interpretation was not correct. This is, in my case, they said these slow biochemical reactions cannot be involved in mediating communication between nerve cells, they were wrong about that.;558;Creativity
But then finally, Arvid Carlsson, do you agree with Eric Kandel that there may be a totally new way of looking on the dynamics of the brain, which is really at the heart of his statements?;"Arvid Carlsson: One direction that I think will become very important is the understanding of the interaction between the different neurotransmitters in complex neuro-circuitries. And there are new possibilities to approach these complex problems. And that deals with something that we can call pattern analysis. You can collect enormous number of data and feed into computers and the computers will feed back to you pictures of the data, that actually are patterns of very, very complex processes in the brain, by means of which you can come closer to these very, very complex mechanisms that deal with the mind, feelings and cognition and so forth.
And maybe even get a picture of the conscious experience then on the screen.
Arvid Carlsson: Yes, and also to distinguish between different personalities. By means of imaging you will tell this is a happy fellow and this other fellow here has a short fuse, that kind of thing.
Eric R Kandel: I also think that the human genome is going to enlighten our understanding of mental processes. One of the deep questions that is a confronted analysis of the mind, has been to what degree is the mind built on the base of genetic information? What is nature versus nurture? What do you inherit versus what do you acquire? And most personality traits are quite complex, so they’re not attributable to one or two genes, so they’ve been very hard to decipher. But now that we will have the whole human genome, we’ll be able to look at patterns of genes and we’ll see to what degree any of our behavioural patterns derive from familial traits versus acquired or learned traits. I think that’s going to be a very rich area for investigation.
Paul Greengard: I would like to go back to your original question and ask you and my two colleagues whether there is any reason to think that we won’t be able to understand the nature of consciousness or any other aspect of the brain. What reason is there for pessimism, given the history of the last decade?
Eric R Kandel: I think it’s hard to know what the limitations of knowledge are. I think it is hard to know at this particular point whether the optimism that we all share, that science can solve all problems in the universe, is in fact true. We’ve solved many problems so far, but there is the possibility that there are limitations to human understanding which we and the computers that we develop will not be able to solve.
Paul Greengard: At the moment we have not reached that point.
Eric R Kandel: We have not reached that point.";558;Future research
So, there is a little discrepancy between you on this one anyhow. But if I rephrase the question and say, will it ever be possible to understand the mechanisms of mind? What is your answer then?;Arvid Carlsson: To understand there is physiological and physiochemical processes that underlie the mind, that we could perhaps reach. But the actual conversion, how these physical phenomena become consciousness, that is what I think is the real tough thing.;559;Meaning(Values) of Work
But if you understand the mechanisms or the things that are changing, you can see them, you can measure them, then you can influence the whole system.;"Arvid Carlsson: That is very true.
In that way, if my question contains the possibility of interfere with all aspects of mind, your answer is yes.
Arvid Carlsson: Yes.
Paul Greengard?
Paul Greengard: I think that the history of science indicates that one by one various barriers have disappeared in areas that the human race thought were impossible to resolve. And everything seems to be solvable. And I don’t see why an understanding of how we think and what consciousness is wouldn’t be approachable in the same way. I think it’s going to be a very long time till we understand the nature of consciousness, even today with these imaging techniques you can start finding out precisely which type of cells are active when you do this or this type of thinking. It certainly should be possible to do similar imaging and understand when people are awake and asleep and I don’t think it’s a huge step beyond that to understand the nature of consciousness.";559;Meaning(Values) of Work
So you’re only putting more weight to the answer that all the different mechanisms that at the end lead to the consciousness experience, those mechanisms can be known and cleared. Is science limitless?;Paul Greengard: In certain principles such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle I think yes it’s limitless. I didn’t always feel that way, it just seems that if you look what happened in the last 30 years it’s unbelievable what the human mind can achieve.;559;Future research
Eric Kandel, on the mechanisms of mind, of course you would have to answer yes on that question as well.;"Eric R Kandel: I sort of come down more on Paul’s side. First of all, I think one needs to distinguish between mechanisms of mind, which involves all operations related to mental processes, action, thoughts, memory, perception, and consciousness. There’s lots of perception, mental processes going on of which we’re unconscious for example. You’re shaking your head as we talk, you’re probably not completely aware of the fact that you’re engaged in sort of reflexive autonomic movements as you talk. Those are mental processes but they’re not necessarily conscious ones. And we have made very good progress in understanding aspects of perception and motor action and I’m confident we will continue to do that.
The mechanism of consciousness is a fascinating one, and one that is getting a lot of attention. Not necessarily a lot of scientific progress, but a lot of attention. Francis Crick has developed a paradigm for looking at attention and consciousness, saying that one ought to look at a simple version of it, which is selective attention. You know, when I sit in this room, I attend to you but I’m also in the background perceiving pictures on the wall and things like this. But there’s a special effort involved in selectively attending to you, so the difference between perceiving something and the heightened selection that goes on with attention, is something he’s been studying in experimental animals with the help of other people. And there is now pretty good understanding of how a monkey, for example, attends to a visual image compared to just looking at the image without attention. So simple cases of conscious awareness are beginning to be analysable. To what degree consciousness of oneself, the most interesting parts of consciousness, become understood is unclear as yet. I sort of agree with Paul that a lot of problems that seemed insoluble became soluble with time. When there’s no add of time, we haven’t reached the limit by any means. It is conceivable that this problem is so difficult that the human mind may not have the computational power to analyse it, but we are far from reaching that particular barrier.";559;Creativity
But you stick to some of the mechanisms to start with, the one that Arvid Carlsson has discovered is dopamine, and I think there is a fascinating correlation between too little dopamine – then you lose control over your body – and too much dopamine – you lose control over your mind. Is that so Arvid Carlsson?;Arvid Carlsson: As well as the body.;559;Meaning(Values) of Work
But is there some sort of relation between the mind and the body in this respect that is basically the same mechanism that in a way controls the material world and the mental world?;Arvid Carlsson: That’s a very interesting question. Anatomically the wiring that analyse movements and the wiring that analyse mental processes are very similar. The balance between different neurotransmitters involved in either of these two is very similar. And have probably evolved along with each other which, in a way, makes a lot of sense because if one goes ahead of the other you’ll have no use for it. The mind and movement have to evolve in parallel.;559;Future research

That could be the basis of a new development that would enrich our understanding. So I think that’s a very important development.;559;Research
And what would be the conceptual change of that idea?;Paul Greengard: Right now it’s thought that the brain has very little ability to repair itself. And with these new ideas that’s not the case. I would like to go back and correct something that I said, refer to something Arvid said on this. The people who are our predecessors, what they did was not wrong, their interpretation was wrong. For example, in his case, they said no, this molecule dopamine cannot be a neurotransmitter, so in that sense they were wrong. The experimental work they had done was correct, their interpretation was not correct. This is, in my case, they said these slow biochemical reactions cannot be involved in mediating communication between nerve cells, they were wrong about that.;559;Creativity
But then finally, Arvid Carlsson, do you agree with Eric Kandel that there may be a totally new way of looking on the dynamics of the brain, which is really at the heart of his statements?;"Arvid Carlsson: One direction that I think will become very important is the understanding of the interaction between the different neurotransmitters in complex neuro-circuitries. And there are new possibilities to approach these complex problems. And that deals with something that we can call pattern analysis. You can collect enormous number of data and feed into computers and the computers will feed back to you pictures of the data, that actually are patterns of very, very complex processes in the brain, by means of which you can come closer to these very, very complex mechanisms that deal with the mind, feelings and cognition and so forth.
And maybe even get a picture of the conscious experience then on the screen.
Arvid Carlsson: Yes, and also to distinguish between different personalities. By means of imaging you will tell this is a happy fellow and this other fellow here has a short fuse, that kind of thing.
Eric R Kandel: I also think that the human genome is going to enlighten our understanding of mental processes. One of the deep questions that is a confronted analysis of the mind, has been to what degree is the mind built on the base of genetic information? What is nature versus nurture? What do you inherit versus what do you acquire? And most personality traits are quite complex, so they’re not attributable to one or two genes, so they’ve been very hard to decipher. But now that we will have the whole human genome, we’ll be able to look at patterns of genes and we’ll see to what degree any of our behavioural patterns derive from familial traits versus acquired or learned traits. I think that’s going to be a very rich area for investigation.
Paul Greengard: I would like to go back to your original question and ask you and my two colleagues whether there is any reason to think that we won’t be able to understand the nature of consciousness or any other aspect of the brain. What reason is there for pessimism, given the history of the last decade?
Eric R Kandel: I think it’s hard to know what the limitations of knowledge are. I think it is hard to know at this particular point whether the optimism that we all share, that science can solve all problems in the universe, is in fact true. We’ve solved many problems so far, but there is the possibility that there are limitations to human understanding which we and the computers that we develop will not be able to solve.
Paul Greengard: At the moment we have not reached that point.
Eric R Kandel: We have not reached that point.";559;Future research
So, there is a little discrepancy between you on this one anyhow. But if I rephrase the question and say, will it ever be possible to understand the mechanisms of mind? What is your answer then?;Arvid Carlsson: To understand there is physiological and physiochemical processes that underlie the mind, that we could perhaps reach. But the actual conversion, how these physical phenomena become consciousness, that is what I think is the real tough thing.;560;Meaning(Values) of Work
But if you understand the mechanisms or the things that are changing, you can see them, you can measure them, then you can influence the whole system.;"Arvid Carlsson: That is very true.
In that way, if my question contains the possibility of interfere with all aspects of mind, your answer is yes.
Arvid Carlsson: Yes.
Paul Greengard?
Paul Greengard: I think that the history of science indicates that one by one various barriers have disappeared in areas that the human race thought were impossible to resolve. And everything seems to be solvable. And I don’t see why an understanding of how we think and what consciousness is wouldn’t be approachable in the same way. I think it’s going to be a very long time till we understand the nature of consciousness, even today with these imaging techniques you can start finding out precisely which type of cells are active when you do this or this type of thinking. It certainly should be possible to do similar imaging and understand when people are awake and asleep and I don’t think it’s a huge step beyond that to understand the nature of consciousness.";560;Meaning(Values) of Work
So you’re only putting more weight to the answer that all the different mechanisms that at the end lead to the consciousness experience, those mechanisms can be known and cleared. Is science limitless?;Paul Greengard: In certain principles such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle I think yes it’s limitless. I didn’t always feel that way, it just seems that if you look what happened in the last 30 years it’s unbelievable what the human mind can achieve.;560;Future research
Eric Kandel, on the mechanisms of mind, of course you would have to answer yes on that question as well.;"Eric R Kandel: I sort of come down more on Paul’s side. First of all, I think one needs to distinguish between mechanisms of mind, which involves all operations related to mental processes, action, thoughts, memory, perception, and consciousness. There’s lots of perception, mental processes going on of which we’re unconscious for example. You’re shaking your head as we talk, you’re probably not completely aware of the fact that you’re engaged in sort of reflexive autonomic movements as you talk. Those are mental processes but they’re not necessarily conscious ones. And we have made very good progress in understanding aspects of perception and motor action and I’m confident we will continue to do that.
The mechanism of consciousness is a fascinating one, and one that is getting a lot of attention. Not necessarily a lot of scientific progress, but a lot of attention. Francis Crick has developed a paradigm for looking at attention and consciousness, saying that one ought to look at a simple version of it, which is selective attention. You know, when I sit in this room, I attend to you but I’m also in the background perceiving pictures on the wall and things like this. But there’s a special effort involved in selectively attending to you, so the difference between perceiving something and the heightened selection that goes on with attention, is something he’s been studying in experimental animals with the help of other people. And there is now pretty good understanding of how a monkey, for example, attends to a visual image compared to just looking at the image without attention. So simple cases of conscious awareness are beginning to be analysable. To what degree consciousness of oneself, the most interesting parts of consciousness, become understood is unclear as yet. I sort of agree with Paul that a lot of problems that seemed insoluble became soluble with time. When there’s no add of time, we haven’t reached the limit by any means. It is conceivable that this problem is so difficult that the human mind may not have the computational power to analyse it, but we are far from reaching that particular barrier.";560;Creativity
But you stick to some of the mechanisms to start with, the one that Arvid Carlsson has discovered is dopamine, and I think there is a fascinating correlation between too little dopamine – then you lose control over your body – and too much dopamine – you lose control over your mind. Is that so Arvid Carlsson?;Arvid Carlsson: As well as the body.;560;Meaning(Values) of Work
But is there some sort of relation between the mind and the body in this respect that is basically the same mechanism that in a way controls the material world and the mental world?;Arvid Carlsson: That’s a very interesting question. Anatomically the wiring that analyse movements and the wiring that analyse mental processes are very similar. The balance between different neurotransmitters involved in either of these two is very similar. And have probably evolved along with each other which, in a way, makes a lot of sense because if one goes ahead of the other you’ll have no use for it. The mind and movement have to evolve in parallel.;560;Future research
And in this system you have discovered the chemical signal substances between the connection between the nerves, and Paul Greengard your discovery is really what is happening inside the cell. How does your discovery relate to how we react and how we are, how we experience the world? Are there any connections that you have thought of?;Paul Greengard: The work that we did elucidates how these chemicals, the neurotransmitters which are the mechanism by which the nerve cells communicate with each other, how they produce their responses in the target cells on which they act.;560;Creativity
And they are related to what sort of mental phenomena?;Paul Greengard: All mental phenomena, memory, consciousness and everything else, is all attributable to the behaviour of nerve cells and what the three of us are doing is trying to understand how one nerve cell communicates with another. It’s through the release of a chemical, a neurotransmitter which activates the second nerve cell and then what happens in the second nerve cell once the neurotransmitter activates it and then how that in turn sends a neurotransmitter to the third nerve cell. What we’re doing at this present level, all three of us, is to understand these biological systems going on, these biochemical molecular systems. Other types of neuroscientists, brain scientists, will take the kind of things that we’re doing and try to relate them to the higher order of behaviour in the nervous system.;560;Creativity
But if Arvid Carlsson has done something in between the synapses where the signals are changing the connections between them, you’re only working with molecules inside the cell and how molecules are changing their shape and their effectiveness, what they do, the proteins we are talking about.;Paul Greengard: What we’ve done is to take these neurotransmitters that Arvid Carlsson had been studying and study exactly how they produce chemical and electrical changes in the nerve cells, working out what those biochemical steps are.;560;Future research
And they are related to memory in what way?;Paul Greengard: That remains to be understood to a large extent. Except Eric Kandel’s work addresses that and maybe he’d like to speak to that.;560;Meaning(Values) of Work
So, memory and changes inside the nerve cells, Eric Kandel. What is the concept or idea?;Eric R Kandel: Let me pick up what Paul Greengard was saying. One way to conceive of the contribution the three of us have made is to think of two sets of processes in the brain – mediating and modulating. That there are vast synoptic connections that are responsible for mediating many of the actions, for example motor actions, sensory perception. But the wonderful thing about the brain is that it can regulate the strength of connections. And my colleagues and I have shown that this occurs during learning, that the strength of connections are not fixed, but that inputs such as serotonergic input or dopaminergic input can modulate the strength of synoptic connections. And it does so by activating processes similar to the kind that Paul Greengard has described. In Aplysia one can show …;560;Meaning(Values) of Work
Aplysia, that is the sea snake that you have been working with?;"Yes, one can show that in fact that a very simple withdrawal reflex, like the withdrawal of a hand from a hot object, can be dramatically amplified by an aversive stimulus. And that amplification involves activation of one of these modular choice systems, the serotonergic system that activates a signalling system within the cell. And activation of that signalling system causes strengthening of the synoptic connection, which is responsible for the enhanced withdrawal.
That means that there is a physical change of the size, so memories are actually made of these changes.
Eric R Kandel: Anatomical changes. That’s right.
This is somewhat exciting that the fast reactions, that is electricity and the somewhat slower …
Eric R Kandel: The fast, and not simply electricity, the faster also chemical transmitters but they act on different receptors.
But long term things are also represented by long term changes.
Eric R Kandel: That’s right.";560;Research
You have all been part of a dramatic shift in paradigm when it comes to looking at the brain because all electrophysiology before and when you entered this stage you changed the picture totally into biochemistry. Arvid Carlsson, why did you choose to go contrary and against everyone else?;Arvid Carlsson: I think it depended to some extent on ignorance. I was not so well read in the field of brain physiology, so I could look at the facts in a simple, straight forward way, whereas those people who were burdened by a lot of knowledge, they had to think in other terms. They were, so to speak, fixed in the dogma. I was outside, just because of my ignorance, I think.;560;Motivation
Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard, what makes someone want to go towards the conventional wisdom of the time?;Paul Greengard: In the case of the study of the brain at the time that Arvid, Eric and I did our work, there were two approaches to understanding brain function. There were physiologists who worked in physiology departments and studied the electrical properties of nerve cells. And there were biochemists working in biochemistry laboratories who took a brain or a liver or a muscle and threw it into a homogeniser and studied the chemicals in the brain. And the two groups did not interact. The people sitting biochemistry were only interested in the biochemistry of the brain. The people doing physiology were only interested in the electrical property of the brain. In one sense we were not going against dogma. There was very little prior art out there. In my own case, my work was guided by the hypothesis that a particular mechanism that had been shown to work in the endocrine system, in which hormone released from one cell activates a target cell, that that system might be analogous to how two nerve cells communicate with each other. And that is through a chemical mechanism, that hypothesis turned out to be correct.;560;Creativity
Eric Kandel, you started off as being a psychoanalyst interested in psychoanalysis and everyone thought that was the gateway to the brain at that time. How come that you didn’t believe it?;Eric R Kandel: I did at the beginning and I still find the psychoanalytic view a rich and nuance view of the mind. I just became disappointed as I continued my medical education with how much empirical evidence there was to support it and how devoid it was in thinking about the brain. I became a little bit interested in the brain and as I got more deeply involved I became fascinated with it. And it struck me that memory is the central question in psychoanalysis. And in the 1950s when I began, the dominant view of the brain was that of Karl Lashley at Harvard, who showed that memory was not localisable. That you could remove many regions of the brain and not interfere with memory. What Lashley did not realise is that animals are very smart and if you remove a part of the brain, for example, let’s just say they’re doing a spatial task, if you remove the visual part of the brain, they will use tactile stimuli to find the way, or smell. They have lots of different strategies they can use. I thought one needed to take an extremely simple animal, an extremely simple reflex, where there would be no question about localizability.;560;Creativity
Excuse me for interrupting, but I got so curious, but this is true that you have all entered a new way of looking at things that were contrary to the conventional views of the time. And still the question I am really curious about is how is your mental set up to want to go against this?;"Eric R Kandel: I think each of the three of us gave a somewhat similar answer, in the sense that we did not think of ourselves as revolutionaries at the barricades. We were working along and we thought that one way of moving in the field was the sound one, it’s almost an intuition that this is the right way to go. It turned out be in opposition to what other people were thinking, but one wants to think in original ways, you try to tackle a problem you think is interesting and approach it in the way that you think is most profound.
Paul Greengard: To amplify what Eric said, it’s not that we were going against conventional wisdom, we were following our own instinct. This must be the way it works. And then more conservative folks would say we were disagreeing with them, but we weren’t, we were just looking at things in a different way.
So in a way it was a very unconscious way of …
Eric R Kandel: That’s right. I think that’s absolutely right.
Paul Greengard: No, I don’t understand what you mean, an unconscious way?
You didn’t really think about going against what was the convention, you just did what you thought was working.
Paul Greengard: It was nothing that they had done was wrong, we were exploring an area that other people hadn’t explored, I would say.
Do you agree Arvid Carlsson?
Arvid Carlsson: No. I was taken by surprise, I must say, when we reported on our data and all the big figures in the field said, no this can’t be true.
Paul Greengard: But that’s true for all three of us.
Arvid Carlsson: I mean, I was right and they were wrong. I mean that is how I experienced it. I wouldn’t like to give them any sort of excuse that we were right, all of us, after all. I don’t agree.
Paul Greengard: Maybe add a certain limited truth, we said, look we think that there are other things going on than what you’ve been studying and there’s all this and this. And then we’d say, yes, there’s all this and this. And then we’d show it and they’d say, no, you’re wrong. We were never saying they were wrong, I don’t think. They were saying we were wrong.
Arvid Carlsson: They were wrong, in my opinion.
Eric R Kandel: I must say that Roy Spencer and I wrote an article in 1968, when we first began to realise that learning could be localised to specific synopses. And we pointed out that Lashley’s view, which was the dominant view, had misled the field.";560;Creativity
But if we look then in the future, this is not the last time where things are going to be turned upside down. Have you seen anything in the current science that indicates that there will be maybe a totally new model coming up of how the brain is working? Maybe adding some fundamental new knowledge to the function of the brain?;"Paul Greengard: It’s exactly what I’m saying. There will be totally new ways of looking that will not necessarily be contradictory to what we did. What we’re doing is eliminating truths just like the people before us had even more eliminating truths, and the next people add on to that. And they’re not going to prove that the work that we did was incorrect, they’re going to show a new dimension.
Eric R Kandel: It’s almost probabilistic in a sense. The views that we have ended up supporting existed before, just to a minor degree, so people had seen in the endocrine system the kinds of things that Paul discovered in the nervous system. Kajal had spoken about the fact that synopsis could be the site of memory storage. But at the time that we were working those views were rare, very few people held that. Most people held the opposing point of view. For example, many people felt that Bernhard Katz and Eccles had described synoptic transmission in the nervous system, it was fast synoptic transmission. So they thought all synoptic transmission in the brain was fast. When Paul and I began to study slow synoptic transmission, they thought there’s something unusual about this and people were initially sceptical that this could be of importance.";560;Future research
But when the two models that has exchanged for each other, the electrophysiological model, the biochemistry model, what do you think about the future, Arvid Carlsson, are there totally new things coming up?;Arvid Carlsson: I guess there will be paradigm shifts in the future. But I think it’s inherent in the definition of dogma that we cannot identify it. As soon as we identify it as a dogma, it’s no more a dogma.;560;Future Research
But before there’s a thunderstorm coming up you can always see a little glimpse of the lightening coming, do you see any glimpse here?;Eric R Kandel: We certainly see that. For example, we thought that the nervous system by the time a child is four or five years old, does not generate any more nerve cells. We thought that the number of nerve cells in the brain are limited – if you lose nerve cells as a result of disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, there’s no way of replenishing those nerve cells from the cells in the brain. There’s now increasing evidence that there is a primitive population of cells that stays around in the brain and they can be the source of additional cells later on. That could be the basis of a new development that would enrich our understanding. So I think that’s a very important development.;560;Research
And what would be the conceptual change of that idea?;Paul Greengard: Right now it’s thought that the brain has very little ability to repair itself. And with these new ideas that’s not the case. I would like to go back and correct something that I said, refer to something Arvid said on this. The people who are our predecessors, what they did was not wrong, their interpretation was wrong. For example, in his case, they said no, this molecule dopamine cannot be a neurotransmitter, so in that sense they were wrong. The experimental work they had done was correct, their interpretation was not correct. This is, in my case, they said these slow biochemical reactions cannot be involved in mediating communication between nerve cells, they were wrong about that.;560;Creativity
But then finally, Arvid Carlsson, do you agree with Eric Kandel that there may be a totally new way of looking on the dynamics of the brain, which is really at the heart of his statements?;"Arvid Carlsson: One direction that I think will become very important is the understanding of the interaction between the different neurotransmitters in complex neuro-circuitries. And there are new possibilities to approach these complex problems. And that deals with something that we can call pattern analysis.

And maybe even get a picture of the conscious experience then on the screen.
Arvid Carlsson: Yes, and also to distinguish between different personalities. By means of imaging you will tell this is a happy fellow and this other fellow here has a short fuse, that kind of thing.
Eric R Kandel: I also think that the human genome is going to enlighten our understanding of mental processes. One of the deep questions that is a confronted analysis of the mind, has been to what degree is the mind built on the base of genetic information? What is nature versus nurture?

I think it is hard to know at this particular point whether the optimism that we all share, that science can solve all problems in the universe, is in fact true. We’ve solved many problems so far, but there is the possibility that there are limitations to human understanding which we and the computers that we develop will not be able to solve.
Paul Greengard: At the moment we have not reached that point.
Eric R Kandel: We have not reached that point.";560;Future research
What brought you to science?;Honestly, I have to say my high school teacher, who said that ‘You could be a scientist’, and he said it so many times that at the end I believed it and I imagined myself that I will be a scientist and imagine going to work and every day figure out something. I had never seen a scientist, I grew up in a very small town, and I decided that I will be a scientist. Somebody is believing in you, maybe that’s the inspiration.;503;Motivation
What do you enjoy most about science?;Science is fun, to be a scientist, this is a fun job. What is exciting is that there is a complexity, and then it is you who can solve it by reading articles or doing experiments and put together things which maybe nobody did. Then you realise what’s going on. The joy that you were the first one to know that this is how things happens. That’s one. It is very similar to be like a detective or an investigator on a crime, but the end of it, you don’t find a perpetrator, you find a solution, and maybe that solution would help somebody. That’s what is the beauty about it, maybe somebody who’s sick and then your discovery can contribute to their healing.;503;Motivation
How have you maintained your focus despite all the obstacles you have faced?;I have to say that people judged me unsuccessful when I felt very successful, because in the laboratory I was in full control of doing experiment, getting question asked and then getting the answer for it. Of course, you never get the answer because when you do an experiment, you get more questions instead of the answer. But this is what is exciting. It seems that not getting funded and there are other difficulties. But actually, when you are a scientist, you constantly have to fight the failures and solve problem difficulties. You keep repeating, you don’t understand, so it is like scientists are those who can get up and keep working with the same enthusiasm. That’s actually some defined success that you can stand up and you can keep on with the same enthusiasm as before.;503;Creativity
What advice do you usually share with young scientists when they are facing obstacles?;"I have seen that the young scientists are comparing themself to the others, seeing that they are maybe less hard workers, and they are advancing. I say, ‘Don’t do that. You have to focus on what you can do’. If you already took away your attention and paying attention on somebody else, you won’t succeed. You have to focus on what you can do, what your project is. I also tell them, to be a scientist is not for everybody. If you like to follow instructions, maybe you have to go to the military. You like to be in the spotlight, like I am right now, you have to be an actress or maybe a reporter. Because a scientist is usually thinking in the laboratory and is not in the spotlight like I am. You have to enjoy no matter what kind of work you are doing. That’s the most important.
I tell them also that physical and mental health is very critical. I used to exercise every morning. I was running six kilometres, even when, 10 years ago, I worked in Germany and on the Rhine, I ran six kilometres, once I even ran the marathon. I was 50 years old, I set up the goal to make it, and that’s it. You have to learn how to handle stress. That’s also very important. I was very lucky that I learned from Hans Selye who was Hungarian, and he was studying stress. In Hungary, when I was 16 years old, I read his book and learned how to handle it. The mantra is, I can tell the young one – and even the old one if they don’t know about it – is that you have to focus on what you can do. Not that what your boss should do, your wife should do, your neighbour should be quiet or something. You have to decide what you can do about that, that’s what is taking away all of the stress";503;Advice for young scientists
Was there a specific mentor who influenced your career?;My father was a butcher, and I heard that when I was little, I was curious when he opened the pig, and I want to see what is inside, whereas my sister and my mother did not want to see that. I don’t remember that, but they said that I was standing there seeing that now, this animal was moving, now, it’s not moving, what made this animal move? I don’t know, but definitely the teachers. I am very grateful to them, because in elementary school already we had excellent teachers, and we went to … Like with the biologic teacher, we just went to outside in the fall, and he picked up the leaves and said, ‘Oh, it is yellow. Is it the yellow it became because it was green before, or maybe the yellow was behind the green and the green is gone?’ He made us think, ‘Hm, or the red leaves, where is the red coming from?’ I am very grateful to them. In elementary school I already competed in different biologic competitions, and at eighth grade, I was the third best in Hungary.;503;Mentors (Role models)
How was it to visit your home country Hungary after the Nobel Prize announcement?;When I went back to Hungary, to my alma mater, it was a beautiful sunny day, and several hundred people were there and they were cheering, and I was just so surprised. Then in the evening a few thousands were there and every time they said, ‘Say something’ and in the moment, I just remember that when the announcement was made, and on that day we went to the university, there was a flash mob. After that Drew Weissman went to his team to celebrate, I went home. Then I told the people there who were waiting, in Hungary, I told them, ‘Now, I am here. I want to celebrate with you’. Because the city Szeged also is very important because I studied there for five years, and that was one time I met my husband there, we married, my daughter was born in Szeged. All the happy times that I was in this city, so happiness belonged to that city. I told them so, and they were cheering to any word I said, they were cheering.;503;Impact of Nobel on you
What do you plan to do with your prize money?;It is most likely I will spend the money for education and helping students. I don’t really like to brag about things, but all the award I got in Hungary, I never took out from the country. I gave to organisations helping underprivileged children. I, myself benefited from that because my parents had just elementary school education and going to the university, even getting a high school diploma I was in the first in the family. My sister also got a high school diploma and she also got a PhD in economic, but we were from there. I think that those children whose parents may be not educated enough to see that the future brightness of their children should be followed up in higher education. There are programs there, so I gave money for that. Also at the university, my alma mater, University Szeged, some prize money I channelled there. Even other awards, like Princess of Asturias, to the local kids I gave the money back.;503;free time
How was it to move from Hungary to the US?;I was born 68 years ago in Hungary, and up until I was 30 years old I was living in Hungary. I got my education, my PhD, I started research on RNA, even lipids, I did study. Moving to the United States was not easy because I lost my position in Hungary. I tried to find a job in Europe and I applied for a couple of jobs, but I couldn’t apply for finance because we were behind the Iron Curtain and eventually, I had to go all the way to America. I am one of those scientists, I never dreamed about going to America. Everybody was talking, ‘Oh, America’. I was very happy in Hungary, but I had to go. I ended up in Philadelphia, and the system was at that time in the communist Hungary that you are allowed to leave the country with $50 per person, and because I got a job offer, I even was not eligible for the $50. The family, my daughter was two and a half years old, my husband, we had a hundred dollar, so that was difficult to imagine that we are arriving and for one month how we will survive. We had a Russian-made car, and that we sold to my colleague, and then on the black market, we exchanged the Hungarian currency to pound. We got like 800 pounds because they had just pounds, not the dollar, and that’s what we got. That’s how we started in America. Imagine that you go there in 1985, you don’t have a credit card, you have no cell phone, iPhone, we didn’t have any, at that time nobody had. I had nobody there I knew, no family member ever got to America and then no classmate, no teacher, nobody. You just have to learn so quickly how to survive.;503;Environment
What was your first impression of the US?;It was a cultural shock. When arriving immediately they said, ‘Now you have to select a bank’. I said, ‘Why? I don’t need a bank. I never had in Hungary, a bank’. They said, ‘How did you get the salary?’ I said, ‘Oh, it was in an envelope. It was counted all of the last pennies in it’. They said, ‘Oh, we don’t do that’. Everything was a shock because going from Hungary today to there would be very different. But in 1985, it was unbelievable.;503;Environment
What does Hungary mean to you today?;I grew up there, my sister lives there, my mother, she passed away five years ago, but she lived there, I have relatives there and I grew up there. But of course, that Hungary which I left is very different now. I have to say that when I worked the last 10 years in Germany, I felt in Germany more a Hungarian. I could see things there that reminded me of my home. Of course I am happy to go back and talk to fellow scientists and meet my colleagues and fellow students, but it is different. That’s the same way even for United States, because when I was working in Germany and going back, now I go back to University of Pennsylvania, I worked there for 24 years. I worked there, and I don’t know the people, they are changed. Of course the campus also changed a lot.;503;Environment
Tell us about your co-laureate Drew Weissman and your collaboration.;I used to work at the cardiology department, which belonged to the cardiology section, which belonged to the department of medicine. But then from there, I moved to the surgery department, which is a different building, an adjacent building, but I know the code for the Xerox machine only in the medicine. Surgery, where I worked, had no Xerox machine, and we always had to Xerox copy the scientific articles. I keep going back to the prior place, and then I could see this guy I had never seen before. I introduced myself because I kind of like to brag and I told him what I am doing while he was xeroxing. He’s very quiet, so I mentioned him that I work with mRNA, and he said that he came from Anthony Fauci’s lab. At that time it didn’t ring any bell for me, for Fauci was not in the television all the time. Then he said that he wanted to make a therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine for HIV, and we started to talk more. I told him that I can make mRNA for him. He gave me the genes and I cloned and I made RNA and we started to work together. So it is true, we met at the Xerox machine, but that part that we were wrestling and fighting, that was not true. We looked at the data, scientific results, then we were not different. We cut each other words, what does it mean, what we should do, no, we should do that, we were talking like that. But otherwise, he’s quiet more, according to his wife he has a limited number of words he can say one day, and when he goes home, he already used up all. He’s a physician, so when we looked at some data, he was thinking about some disease-related thing, and I was more thinking about the basic science because I am a biochemist. We educated each other. I learned from modern immunology vaccinology from him, and he learned the RNA part. That’s one thing, that where the innovation can come. You might have a big team and you are investigating some phenomenon from many different directions, huge team can do that. Or there are two persons who are on different fields, they understand each other, they respect each other and educate and then they come up with something. Oh, I can do that, I can do. Then they proceed.;503;Creativity
What advice would you like to share with young scientists?;The number one thing: you have to enjoy what you are doing. It is important. You have to realise that you like the things, what you have to do in the rest of your life, as if you select as a job. I mentioned the health is important because you remember the airplane, you have to use the oxygen first on you. If you are not okay, then you cannot help others. You have to be happy, healthy, and stressless. You have to take care of yourself and then you can help others. The young ones, we can go on and on how many things I could tell them about how they should proceed, but the most important thing is that they have to enjoy what they are doing. I have to say what is important if they decide they will be scientists. What I could see is that you have to solve a problem. You are working on this problem. What is the thing is that you publish because you’ve discovered something, and then somehow you want more discovery, more money is needed, applying for fund. Then finally somehow publication is coming because we need more money, we need the promotion, and the goal will be somehow is advancing your career to promote tuition and other things, and the prestige, and somehow the original goal becomes a tool to reach that. You are publishing because you have to get your PhD degree, you need more grant, more money. If you stay with the focus on solving scientific problems, you’ll never be disappointed. When you move to this one and you don’t get the promotion, then you’ll get the disappointment because this will not depend on you, maybe on some other organisation or superiority. But here the problem is always there, you can always work on it.;503;Advice for young scientists
Is diversity important in science?;It is important in science to have women because we are thinking differently. We are multitasking, guys cannot do that very well. People have different views, different thinking as I mentioned, like somebody’s a physician or there is a basic scientist and they are thinking differently. If they work together and respect each other, then a new invention can be done. That’s what I think is important, so I try to emphasize that women are important for science, and the science need more women because at the beginning there are many women graduating schools and they have their dream, but the difficulties might come when they have a childbearing age and they want family. I was lucky in Hungary because we had high quality, affordable childcare, so I could stay at work and I was confident that my daughter was taken care of when I was working. I can see in many countries that if you are not having enough financial support, then you have to give up your job because that little baby is crying there and you have to take care of it. Your dream is just a potential, giving up seems a solution to take care of your child. But if a government is listening, then we have to talk to them how important that would be because more women could do more discoveries,;503;Diversity in Science
Do you see any similarities between sports and science?;It is kind of like setting of a goal. When I was practicing for the marathon, my daughter was biking next to me, ‘Mom, come on, come on, you can do it, you can’. Even when it was the race, she volunteered to give out water, hardly could wait when I will reach that water stand so she can give me the water. The race was in November, in March I started to practice. You are not getting up in one day, ‘Okay, today I run a marathon’ – you will be dead, you cannot run. She could learn that you have to do the preparation every day, do something towards that goal. That’s what setting up goals is what is important, for everybody, a child, old people, everybody has to have a goal and then work towards that and when you reach that, you are setting up a new goal. That’s like they told me, that you get a Nobel Prize, and that’s what you can do after that. I mean, that’s not a goal. A goal is that I am doing my research and then when I am done with certain things, then I set up a new goal – it cannot be a goal to get an award, because anyway it does not depend on me. I told that always I have to focus on what I can do, and those are other people’s decision. That’s for the firing and terminating my position. I also said that it was other people’s decision and I have to focus on what I can do instead of feeling sorry for myself Why me? There were other people could be fired. Why me? No, don’t spend your time because you are feeling down and feeling sorry for yourself. You focus on, okay, now what should I do? Because  you can make a decision, and that’s what important. I mentioned that it is not necessary that you have to be happy if you are terminated in a position. I was not happy, but did not spend time on being sad, but I have to do something next.;503;Creativity
When did you learn the importance of setting up goals?;"In the process, as I mentioned, in elementary school when I was writing about Linné, it was for the high school advertise that you can write an essay. Every day I was reading something, writing something, and you work towards and submitting that essay. That’s already the win. I never get any award for that, and that is not important. I set up a goal and accomplish, and then the next goal to set up, and maybe my daughter, watching me, learn that. That’s what I say to also the parents. You don’t have to over assist your child; they like to be independent. Rather than what you are showing that you go to work, what is important, how you talk to other people, that’s what they watch. They could learn from that. You can tell them certain things and they can see that you are acting differently. They notice that and they will take on that. So, if you work hard and you enjoy your work and your child want to do that also.";503;Competencies
Did you realise how important your research would be during the COVID-19 pandemic?;I worked at BioNTech and BioNTech signed with Pfizer in 2018 to develop mRNA-based vaccine for influenza. We already worked two years, -18 and -19, and we did all of the studies and were ready for start a human trial for influenza. The technology is such that you just have to change – I should say just, but, still is a process – change template and then you can make the different kind of vaccine, and that’s what happened. We were ready with all of this preparation for another fight, another disease. But here we had to have prophylactic vaccine for the sars covid 2, and the influenza was ready, so a lot of preparation was done for a different virus, but it is now, it’s phase three trial. The vaccine for influenza is very important that the RNA, because it is always from the four nucleotides, contains the four nucleotides, so we can have a multivalent vaccine. The influenza, again, influenza A and B and different many different proteins encoding RNA can be in one shot. Right now, not even just the influenza, but even the covid vaccine and respiratory CCR virus, it’s one shot because you can combine them. If it would be protein based, you cannot do that because they will stick to each other and then will have an aggregate because the protein can be charged negative, positive or hydrophobic hydrophilic, and you cannot mix them. But the RNA, you can do it and the subject will synthesise the protein, and then those proteins will teach the immune system. That’s what the enemy is, you have to recognise.;503;Creativity
How does it feel to know that your research has saved millions of lives?;I have to say that I myself, I never felt that I did. I relied on the work on many other people, I was doing research for 20, 30 years. I learned from reading articles from people who are not with us anymore, and I learned from it. I had colleagues and so many, many people who contributed. I feel that we did it. We scientists, with all of my colleagues at Pfizer, BioNTech as well as University Pennsylvania, and those scientists who worked on the field. That’s how I feel, and I have to say, I was lucky. I never had this craving of recognition. There are some people who want to be recognised. For me, it was enough that I know that what I did and what is important and not that other people would know. For me, I feel that a lot of scientists, hundreds and thousands of scientists, contributed to the knowledge, because the RNA was discovered 60 years ago, and during those 60 years, many things happened. I will present that on my presentation and the Nobel presentation lecture. I will tell you that how many things was discovered and was contributed by scientists. As a scientist, I felt that I didn’t expect it that what I am doing will be that important. I know that it is important. I know that one day maybe other scientists will take on and reaching in one day a level that somebody will be helped.;503;Meaning (Values) of Work
What brought you to science?;It’s a great question. I’m 64 years old, so there might’ve been when I was five and I just don’t remember anymore. Probably one of the big things. When I was five years old, I was diagnosed with type one diabetes, and back then the life expectancy of kids wasn’t a full life. My parents knew that, I learned about that later. I’m not sure that being a diabetic influenced me into science. I was always interested in engineering and science growing up. So maybe.;504;Motivation
How important were your parents to your scientific career?;We’ve always been a close family. And they sparked education, and they wanted us to get education and to get as much education as we wanted. I don’t think they cared if it was in science, math, physics, engineering, I think they cared about just getting a good education.;504;Motivation
What do you enjoy most about science?;I think it’s really searching the unknown, trying to understand things that we don’t understand, and trying to be able to figure out how things work. My family tells jokes, when I was a little kid, I used to take everything apart to understand how it worked. We never had a toaster that worked, and the doorknobs rarely ever worked because I was always taking everything apart to try and understand how things work. I’m still that way now with science and immunology and RNA, but it’s really just the curiosity to understand how things work, how they really work.;504;Motivation
Have you had mentors who have influenced your career?;There have been a few and at different stages of my career there were different people who were mentors, who were teachers. Early on it was Jerry Fasman at Brandeis University, who gave me my first research job and taught me how to think about research. After that, it was Ann Marshak, who I did my PhD with, who taught me critical thinking and how to read and understand the literature and how to formulate ideas into practice. After that, it was probably Tony Fauci when I worked in his lab, who gave me the freedom to investigate whatever I wanted. He was interested in HIV, I started on a whole new topic in his lab because I thought it would be interesting, and I thought it was important, and he both gave me that freedom, but helped me think about it to create interesting ideas.;504;Mentors (Role models)
Do you see any similarities between sports and science?;I think it was more it prepared me, because I’m told I was a hyperactive kid. Back then, they didn’t treat hyperactive kids, they just let them run around the house and bounce off of walls. But I used sports and martial arts as a way of controlling my thinking and controlling my activity and being able to focus. I think those are really critical to be a good scientist, because if you’re bouncing off of walls, you can’t formulate ideas, you can’t test new hypotheses, and that helped me overcome that, that hyperactivity.;504;Creativity
How did you celebrate the news of your Nobel Prize?;"It was kind of a funny interaction. I got a message from Katie Karikó at four in the morning that said, ‘Did Tom call?’ Katie has a habit of sending cryptic notes that I don’t understand, and I texted her back, ‘Tom, who?’ Then I called her and, and we talked at four in the morning, and she said, Well, you know, Tom from the Nobel Foundation called and said that we won the award, but he also said, could I give him your phone number? Because he had a bad phone number for me. And we said, you know, This sounds like a joke. I think some, some anti-vaxxer is playing around with us, this is all a joke, and we didn’t believe it. Then Tom finally called around 05:15 in the morning, and I started to believe it, but I still wasn’t sure. I waited until the video on the internet around six, and then I believed it.
My older daughter had just returned from her honeymoon Sunday evening, had not been to sleep yet, and I called her at six in the morning and said, I won the Nobel Prize. She hopped on a train and took the train up to Philadelphia to be with us. My younger daughter … We kept trying to locate and leave messages for her and find she wouldn’t answer her phone, she wouldn’t answer anything. We called her friends who told them to go over to wake her up. She finally answered the phone, she goes, Why the hell are you waking me up so early in the morning? and hung up the phone, so we didn’t see her until dinner time. My children had a very different way of celebrating the award.";504;Impact of Nobel on you
Tell us about your co-laureate Katalin Karikó and your collaboration.;"You’ll hear about this when I present my gift to the museum. The lore is that Katie and I met over a Xerox machine. I have to explain to young people what a Xerox machine is, because they don’t exist anymore, but back then, the only way you could read a scientific paper is if you photocopied it. We both read a lot, and we would both fight over the copy machine, and we started talking. Katie, as she says, she likes to brag about what she does, and she talked about making RNA and I said, Well, that’s interesting, I work on dendritic cells and I’m interested in trying RNA on them. So it’s, I joke, it’s like the old Reese’s commercial, the chocolate and peanut butter coming together and making a great candy bar. That’s what our meeting at the Xerox machine was like.
Katie was very outgoing, very aggressive, very forceful in what she believed in. I’m a quiet guy, I’m happy just working in the background, not being in the limelight, not being in front of audiences, and Katie enjoys being in front of the audience and running the show. The other Nobel laureates, we were at the House of Sweden, and Katie and I were sitting down and Katie was directing everything, and they turned to me and they said, Oh, we understand how your relationship goes now. It was kind of humorous.";504;Creativity
How important is collaboration in science?;To me, that’s really the critical thing in science. Right now my lab collaborates with about 250 labs around the world, in every continent except Antarctica. We haven’t found any scientists in Antarctica to collaborate with, to make it all, but we’re close, just about every country in the world. I spend a lot of time just going and visiting collaborators to work on projects, to help understand model systems and diseases. All of our work is really done through collaboration, it’s incredibly critical.;504;Creativity
How important is equity in science?;It brings you into my other interest in my career, which is equity, and which is making sure the same science and the same medicines are available across the world. I’ve had a lab in Thailand for about 30 years, and I’ve had a lab in Botswana for about 25 years. The chief purpose of both of those was involving local scientists, teaching them about vaccines, about RNA, about different therapeutics that we develop, and then getting them to set up their own labs and set up their own infrastructure. With Thailand, we built a GMP production site. What that means is anything you give to people, any drug, any vaccine, has to be produced under GMP production capabilities, which is very expensive, very highly monitored situations, so we built a GMP site in Thailand. After that, I’ve built 17 more across the world in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, across Eastern Europe – really across the world. We’ve got one right now, operating in the Ukraine, which I’m amazed about. I can’t wait to visit, to actually see how they’re running a GMP site in the middle of a war, but they are.;504;Creativity
What advice would you like to share with young scientists?;I think young scientists have to think about a lot of things, and I spend a lot of time talking to junior high school and high school students, because I think by the time they get to college, if they don’t want to be a scientist, it’s too late to convince them. You have to start very early and maybe even elementary school, just stimulating their knowledge of science, but I think that’s when you have to get to kids and you have to present to them what science is, what it involves. I did an experiment with a Nobel group yesterday where we made purified DNA from strawberries. That will be a video for young kids to learn about science, and I think those sort of things – just to stimulate interest – not every kid is going be a scientist, I don’t expect that to happen. But any kid that’s curious, that wants to understand things, that’s interested in biology or chemistry or physics or math, I think those kids should consider science as a field to go into. It’s incredibly rewarding, it’s a ton of work, it’s not like going into your father’s business and taking over and having everything laid out for you. It’s a lot of work to set up to establish yourself to become acclimated and, and successful. But the rewards are enormous.;504;Advice for young scientists
How can we encourage diversity in science?;My usual answer to that is I’m a scientist, I’m not a sociologist. I don’t know how you encourage that. The way I do it is I work with teachers because teachers understand their students and teachers know how to influence, to get messages to their students. I’m working with the experts who know what they’re doing. I’m happy to say what I need to say to get people interested, but I think we really have to go with the teachers.;504;Diversity in Science
How have you managed to cultivate your curiosity?;I’m sure some of it was genetic because my father is similar. He was an engineer and then decided to start his own business in a completely different field of engineering, and he learned, and he developed and he invented. I think a lot of it is genetic.;504;Creativity
How does it feel to know that your research has saved millions of lives?;I still … It hasn’t sunk in. My view … I’m a physician researcher. I got an MD and a PhD, and my interest starting when I was young was always … I had hoped to someday develop some treatment that would make people better. I think I’ve accomplished that. The number to me is I guess, less important. It’s fantastic that it has helped millions of people. I think in the future, it’s going help a lot more because there’s so much potential that can be done with RNA therapeutics between gene therapy, between therapeutics, protein deliveries, it’s just enormous what can be done. And to me, that’s what I’m looking forward to.;504;Meaning (Values) of Work
What are some future uses of your mRNA research?;"I think gene therapy is probably the most important future use. Right now, there are thousands and thousands of genetic diseases. The main way they’re treated is symptomatic. You try to make people better, you give them drugs that make the disease a little better. Most people still die of their genetic disease at young ages. The hope for the future is going to be gene therapy, where you fix the broken gene. The problem with that is there are a few gene therapies. There’s one for sickle cell that’s being approved right now, it costs 1-4 million dollars per person, and sickle cell – 300,000 people a year born with the disease, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa – they don’t have facilities to do gene therapy. They don’t have a million dollars a person to afford gene therapy. So, what we’re doing is we’re developing what we call in vivo gene therapy.
Instead of taking cells out of a patient, infecting them with viruses, screwing around with them in culture and then giving them back, we’re trying to do everything in the body. The only thing our treatment will be is an injection of RNA LNPs. You give one injection, it goes to the bone marrow, it fixes the broken gene, and it cures the disease. If we can do that for sickle cell, there are thousands of other bone marrow genetic diseases that can be done. It’s already been done once for liver diseases, for an amyloidosis, for a company that I work with that gives a single injection of RNA LNPs, and it fixes the genetic disease. It cures the patient so far. To me, that’s the future of gene therapy, because if you can’t use it around the world, great, you save a few people in the US and Europe. But what about everybody else?";504;Future research
What makes you most passionate right now with your research?;"It is like asking a parent which of their children they like better. You can’t really answer that. Or I can’t, I’m passionate about everything that I do. We’re working on vaccines for peanut allergies, and if you’ve ever had a child patient, their lives are nightmares. There’s no really good treatment for that. We are working on vaccines for autoimmune diseases, so no longer will we people be on Methotrexate or Anti-TNF Antibodies, they’ll have specific therapies that won’t suppress their immune systems. We’re working on vaccines for cancer, both to prevent cancer and to treat cancer. We’ve got our variety of gene therapies. We’ve got a big program in HIV cure. The problem with HIV is that once HIV infects somebody, it becomes latently infected in their cells, never goes away.
They predicted 70 years it would take for the virus to disappear on retroviral therapy. We’re working on PNA LNP based therapies that will cure the disease. It’ll cut the virus out of the latent reservoirs and clear it away. We’re working on vaccines to prevent HIV, so someday we’ll be able to both prevent it and cure people that have the disease. We’re working on therapeutics. People nowadays develop heart disease, is the number one killer in the world. We really don’t have great therapeutics. You can operate on somebody and fix the coronary vessels. You can put stents in, they help with the symptomatology. They extend people’s lives, but they don’t last forever. There are many other heart diseases that we have almost no therapies for. We figured out how to target cardiomyocytes, the muscle cells in the heart, so now we can deliver gene editing technology, we can deliver therapeutic proteins, we can do the same for the lung, for the brain, for kidneys, for the immune system. The potential is just enormous.";504;Motivation
How do you like to spend your free time?;Unfortunately, over the past six or seven years, my spare time disappeared, so I really don’t have anymore. When I was younger, and my wife would joke about this, when I would get frustrated at research, I would come home and build something. Build a porch onto the house or renovate a bathroom or renovate a kitchen. I stopped doing that because I just didn’t have time anymore. In the summer, I enjoy the water. I enjoy kayaking and being out on the water.;504;Free time
Where does your passion for science come from?;I really don’t know where my passion from science comes from. I think my initial passion was much more for ancient history or archaeology here in Sweden where I grew up and for Egyptology after my mom took me to Egypt when I was 13 or 14 years old. Later I came to science and realised that one could fuse aspects of science with this interest for our past, both historical past events and evolutionary past events.;505;Motivation
Was there a particular person who influenced you?;I think the person that was most important to me when I grew up was clearly my mother since I grew up alone with my mother in a suburb of Stockholm. I think what was very important was that she had a sort of great respect and passion for schoolwork and learning and she took my nerdy interests very seriously when I got interested in ancient Vikings. She took me to the museum, she would take me around to look at runic stones around Stockholm and measure them and write up what was on them and so on. Then she took me to Egypt where I discovered a fascination of ancient Egypt. I think one thing that also my mother gave me was probably taking life as it comes because she had of course been uprooted by the second World War in Estonia and had to flee to Sweden and arrived here in 1944 when she was 18 years old or 19. Many, many of her classmates did not survive the war, so I think a little bit she took, but of every day as a gift, as I think all of us should do.;505;Mentors (Role models)
How important to teachers and a good learning environment.;I grew up in Bagarmossen, a part of Stockholm where one at that time at least was not necessarily expected to go to university. I think it were a few teachers, for example, that were quite important to me. I remember a teacher of physics at Bergholmsskolan in Bagarmossen who also noticed my interest in ancient things, he collected antiquities and took some along and showed me at a school for example. This thing of feeling that your interests were taken seriously by your teachers was quite important. It’s important in a more research setting, I think, to try to have an atmosphere where everybody in the team can have ideas that they bring in, that you’re not afraid of saying something stupid or so that you realise that nine of ten ideas that come are probably wrong and stupid. But in order to get that 10th idea that’s really brilliant, you have to have an atmosphere where all the things are brought to the table, all ideas are expressed.;505;Mentors (Role models)
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?;Of course hard to say what do you need to be a successful scientist because there are many different things that you need to come together perhaps, and there are also very different ways to being a successful scientist. There are some people that are extremely smart, for example, and that is important. There are other people that are very knowledgeable and really learn from what other people have done. There are people that bring together combinations of knowledge that otherwise no one brings together – that can be very fruitful. I think one cool thing with science is that there is not just one way to be a good scientist.;505;Competencies
What do you enjoy about science?;If you think about science, it’s of course driven, I think, by questions and interests you have, for example to see if we can go back in time and see how our genomes or DNA sequences have changed over time. But then once you endeavour on that, of course science is a collective effort. It’s very much a social thing where you work in a group, try to assemble the people with different competencies and make sure that these people get along with each other and that one can together work towards a goal. That’s in a way what I find probably most stimulating every day is this going together after something.;505;Motivation
How are competition and collaboration related?;Many people talk about competition in science and in some sense I don’t think that that’s an important factor. It’s a human enterprise. Competition comes into it of course, but it’s not the driving force for us. I thin. It’s really going after a question and competing with yourself in a way trying to do it as well and as quickly, of course, as you can.;505;Creativity
What advice would you give to a student or young researcher?;It is hard to say. What advice should you give to the younger scientists that enter the field? I think following your passion and your interests is important because it’s generally automatically the case that if you’re really interested in something, you tend to do it well just because you put in a lot of effort because you find it really interesting. You should follow the things that you are interested in, then at least you have a good time while you do it.;505;Advice for young scientists
How do you cope with failure?;Of course there are many challenges and failures and setbacks on the way. I think if you hold your gaze on what you want to achieve, you can overcome that rather rapidly because you only start thinking about the next experiment. What can you do to … You always live in the grand illusion that the next thing will solve everything that you do.;505;Creativity
What are the key implications of your research?;Our research is then curiosity driven if you like. We want to find out what happened to our ancestors in the past, so we have been able to study the genomes of our closest evolutionary relatives, Neandertals, and we discovered the distant relatives of Neandertals that lived in Asia, the Denisovans, and found that they contributed to the gene pool of people today. That many people today, if your roots are outside Africa, carry genetic variants that come from these earlier forms of humans and that these variants, genetic variants influence our biology today, influence our susceptibility to disease or our sense of pain or many other things.;505;Meaning (Values) of Work
What’s the relationship of Neandertals to modern humans?;Now when we have the genome of our closest evolutionary relative, we can look for genetic changes that are unique to Neandertals and that are unique to fully modern humans that happened in our ancestors during the last half million years and spread to everybody or almost everybody today. We can have this catalogue of the genetic changes that make our genome unique. A research direction that is now becoming very exciting is to try to understand which of these may have functional consequences, which of these changes may influence things such as why modern humans became millions and eventually billions of people spread over the entire planet, spread over open oceans where you don’t see land on the other side, and came to a point today where we influence much of the biosphere.;505;Creativity
What makes us uniquely human?;One can of course ask what makes modern humans unique. That is these things, I think, that we, and not these other forms of humans, became very numerous, started having technology and culture that changed very rapidly and became so numerous that we probably just absorbed these earlier forms into our population. At least that’s probably a large part of why Neandertals, for example, disappeared, we are beginning to learn. I think the big question is to understand in the future what that may have been. It could have been even something more about sociality, that we have the ability to form big societies and transmit much of our knowledge to the next generation. That in reality humans are quite unique in that we spend almost the first third of our lives absorbing all the knowledge that previous generations have generated, and then we build on that. Some people talk about this ratchet effect that in each generation we develop our culture and technology further. I think somewhere there is probably in the future going to be the key what sets modern humans apart so much.;505;Research
How did you celebrate the news of your Nobel Prize?;There was an announcement of this in the beginning of October, it was a great surprise to me, I must say, and was a surprise, I think, to many people in our institute and to many people in the field. I think it feels so good also because it’s sort of a recognition of this entire research field. Yes, there was a lot of celebrations also in the institute immediately actually taking place. It was amazing how many people wrote to me, people from far back in my life that took this as an occasion to contact me again, and that was a lot of fun.;505;Impact of Nobel on you
How is it returning to Stockholm to receive the prize;Surprise, what should I say? Emotional to be back in the city that I grew up in. Unfortunately to say my mother is not around anymore to experience this. It’s of course an amazing feeling also to realise that exactly 40 years ago my father received the same prize here.;505;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Will anything special happen when you return to Germany?;When I have survived this week here, we will have a party for the institute at the oldest techno club in East Germany, actually, which is not far from our institute, The Distillery in Leipzig.;505;Environment
What environments help with creativity?;An amazing thing in my career have been the opportunity that came in the mid-nineties to take part in the founding of this new Max Planck Institute in Leipzig in East Germany. There was a chance to think about how should one create an institute and how would or should one do anthropology in the future. The question that we united the institute from many, many disciplines that moved there was around what makes humans unique, indifferent, genetically, biologically, behaviourally, and so on. It was also a chance to create a building and an environment to bring people together. Of course, science is very international. Many people come from all over the world to work with us and have much of their life in the institute. I think it’s also seemed very important to have things like a sauna on the roof or a climbing wall or things you can do together – things that are not about the science – that you can do together to bring people to talk to each other, all to people from different disciplines that work in different departments.;505;Environment
Why is diversity of all kinds important in science?;Often what is important for the progress of science is to bring different perspectives and opinions together. It can be very useful to bring people with different backgrounds and experiences together. It’s often in a combination of disciplines and knowledges that new things emerge. That said, I think it’s very important that each individual is very rooted in their own area of expertise and then interact with other fields, so to say. You have to be expert in something to appreciate what the other people do.;505;Diversity in Science
Can you tell us about the object that you’re donating to the Nobel Prize Museum?;They of course want you to donate some object to the Nobel Prize Museum here. After some thought, I decided to give them two books, dictionaries of science that my father gave me in 1971 when I decided to not study science in school and rather go for Latin and ancient things. He was a little disappointed with that and gave me these books, I think to say I should keep at least an eye on science still. They remind me about that. Yes, that happened. I did come back to science and it’s a little link back to my dad also.;505;Donation to Nobel
First of all, I want to hear a bit about your childhood. What did you want to be when you were a kid? Did you always want to be a scientist?;No, I didn’t know I wanted to be a scientist until much later in my life. I’m Armenian in origin. I grew up in Lebanon and I lived there the first 18 years of my life. There weren’t any scientists around, science as a career was not something I envisioned. My whole childhood I thought I was going to become a medical doctor. The reason, honestly, it was mainly because my parents wanted a doctor in the family. Funny enough, my brother and sister who were older than me didn’t want to do that because they were very queasy. They couldn’t stand looking at a cockroach for example. I was very brave in the sense that I used to kill cockroaches. So that’s what started me in the medical field, a very uninspiring story. But after immigrating to the United States and going to college to undergraduate at UCLA, I really fell in love with this, at that time decades-old, revolution in molecular biology. I took a molecular biology course, really got inspired, worked in a lab mainly to get a letter of recommendation for medical school, but I really fell in love with doing basic biology research. That’s when I kind of shifted and decided to go into the sciences and get my PhD.;507;Motivation
You spoke about the fact that when you were 18, you moved to the US as an immigrant. That must have been a challenging journey. Can you tell me a bit about that experience?;Yes, it was a very eventful time in my life. I was 18 years old, left all my friends and my parents in Lebanon and I came to the United States. It was indeed very difficult. I thought I was proficient in English, but coming to Los Angeles, I realised I couldn’t understand anybody. That was a big challenge. The culture of course was so different. It was a very big adjustment, but I had to also stop going to college for a year and have odd jobs like delivering pizzas and working in an Armenian newspaper for a year mainly to gain residency so I could go back to college. I came in with $2,000 in my account. It was a very tough year, but I think that experience has really made me tougher and appreciate what I have now. I keep talking about how it’s a privilege to do science. I think those experiences of both growing up in war-torn Lebanon as well as the difficulty of leaving everything and coming has not just toughened me up, but I’ve appreciated everything I have more because I remember those days and that kind of gives me some inspiration to realise how privileged we are.;507;Environment
Could you tell me if there was like a particular person, a role model, parent or teacher that influenced you a lot when you decided on your field?;There’s a few people. As I said, one of the big inspirations was taking this basic molecular biology class. It was called molecular biology seven at UCLA and the teacher was Bob Goldberg. It’s funny to say someone has inspired you because while I was his student I never got to talk to him because the class was very large. It was 200-300 people taking the class and yet he had these amazing ways to make this large class seem like an intimate affair. He had discussions with people, he grouped people into small groups to talk to them, gave us books to read about molecular biology and it felt very intimate. That’s when I really fell in love with the material. I also have to mention, most of education for biology happens in a laboratory. When I was working in Judy Lengyel’s lab at UCLA and there were these two graduate students, Eirikur Steingrimsson and Richard Baldarelli, and they really took me under their wings and showed me how to think about science and how to appreciate it. I really loved it and owe those guys a lot early on to help with my journey.;507;Mentors (Role models)
What would you say is the best thing about being a scientist?;I think this has been said by many before, but when you do an experiment and you find this result that is unexpected, or you realise that you saw something about nature that no one had seen before. You’re the first one observing this, you’re the first one understanding a concept that no one else has. It’s hard to explain that feeling, but I feel like that’s one of the most special things scientists experience. My favourite words are someone from the laboratory coming in and saying, “You got to come to the microscope and take a look at this”, that gets your excitement going like no other sentence.;507;Competencies
What qualities would you say are needed to become a successful scientist?;I’ve been thinking about this a lot and it’s a very unusual combination of traits, I would say. First of all, you have to be dedicated to your science and think and read a lot. I find that people who know the literature very well, who know what’s going on, what’s known in the past is very important to have ideas of what one should do in the future. Strong knowledge is very important. But it’s also important to know what kind of questions to ask. It’s an interesting overlap between being a dreamer where you’re thinking big, you’re imagining answering questions that no one else has, but you have to inject that with a little bit of practicality. What I mean by that is that anyone can dream, but if you dream something unimaginable or something that is not practical to do in the next few years, you might not be successful. People talk about the dreaming part a lot, which is necessary. It’s important, it’s wonderful, but a little bit of practical injection into that is also important. You have to look at where science and the field is and figure out what is really attainable in the next five years or not. That intersection of big thinking and practical approach I think is where success lies.;507;Competencies
Would you say that you have any advice that you would give to young up-and-coming researchers today? What kind of advice do you usually give to your students?;I think in science many times we get discouraged by these practical setbacks that we all experience, a paper doesn’t get accepted, a grant you write does not get funded. Sometimes these difficulties take center stage and you kind of become very upset about them. What I try to remind myself and everyone else is to remember why you got into science to begin with. I used the word privilege before, it’s a privilege to do what we do. We come into the lab every day, ask questions about nature, how things work, and you design to address them. What a great luxury that is, what a privilege it is. I think if you focused on the pleasure we get from the discovery process, the joy we get from doing experiments, I think that takes care of all the other setbacks. Not to minimise the setbacks because they are very important and it’s very difficult to do science. We need lots of support from the government, from funding agencies, etc. But it’s very important also to keep in mind why you got into science to begin with – for the love of science – and keep reminding yourself of that and not taking it for granted is the best advice I can give.;507;Advice for young scientists
How do you think that we can encourage more women or minorities to enter the field of science?;I think the good news is that all scientists that I know are talking about this, I think we realise that there is a problem of not being inclusive for people from underrepresented backgrounds and everyone’s working at this and it’s important to work at it from two perspectives. One is to educate the young and get them interested in science from communities, whether it’s male or female or it’s immigrants, like I was, or people who are not represented in science early on to get them involved, which is very important. But we also want to make sure that the people we already have in science are taken care of and are not discriminated against. I actually hadn’t thought about this too much but I remember that when I first came here, I am kind of a bit ashamed to admit this, but I was trying to hide the fact that I came from Lebanon. I thought my name was very long, difficult to pronounce and people associated Lebanon with war and in my CV where I went one year to American University of Beirut and then graduated from UCLA, early on in my days I didn’t put AUB in there. I just had the bachelor’s degree of science from UCLA, I did not really want to deal with potential negative perceptions of being from the middle east. Honestly after the Nobel Prize, the great positive feedback I’ve received for not just winning the Nobel Prize, but being an immigrant who’s won a Nobel Prize, made me realise that I was thinking about this completely wrong. I’m trying to correct that now by highlighting it more than I normally would. It’s back on my CV. I’m very proud to have this background and if I can help a young kid who sees this and says, “Well, maybe I can do that as well”, then that would be my pleasure.;507;Diversity in Science
Would you say that you see yourself as American or Armenian or would you say that you are an international citizen?;I’ve often said that I found my tribe among scientists. It’s a particular tribe and I am really proud because I witnessed this from every lab I’ve been in. It’s such an international community that work and collaborate together. I definitely identify with that the most, but I have a very interesting mix, of course I’m an American but I grew up mainly speaking Armenian in an Armenian family but was born in Lebanon. I have a very mixed past and I am reconnecting to some of this past as well as realising that most and foremost we’re humans. Human rights and human equality should be at the forefront. Not to diminish the importance of cultural contributions of different countries, which is also very nice and important to celebrate. It’s a very interesting mix.;507;Environment
How do you like to spend your spare time? I’ve seen pictures of you with the trumpet, are you a musician in your spare time?;"I’m a big believer of work and life balance. I feel like one of the great things about science is a lot of it is about thinking, you’re thinking about questions. You can do this any time, any place. I’m not in the lab all the time. I do lots of things outside, but honestly, most times I’m thinking about the science and I don’t think of this as a burden. I think of it as a great thing, because I really enjoy it. Having said that, I love physical activities. I’ve also said before that many of my great science ideas have come to me while I’m running or doing any kind of exercise outdoors because it kind of frees the brain to think in a new way. I love that feeling. I love to hike. I used to love to run. I have a knee injury now, so mostly walking and hiking. We, a bunch of faculty here at Scripps, go swimming in the ocean. I love lots of outdoors things.
I also love music. I like to go to concerts and I play a little bit of trumpet and it’s interesting. I’m really, really bad at it. I’ve played for many years and I have not mastered this instrument. It’s not an easy instrument. But I enjoy being bad at trumpet. Let’s put it that way, but I cannot say the same thing about my wife, son and our two cats who immediately leave the room when I start playing.";507;Free time
On another note: we love your Twitter activity! How do you see Twitter and social media and the responsibilities that we have on social media?;Science Twitter is a very interesting subcategory of Twitter. I like it a lot because it’s a very interesting mix of science, science gossip, and fun as well as science-related issues such as representation and all these things we talked about. It’s not utterly professional. There’s lots of fun in it, but actually it has come to a point where I hear about new scientific studies from PubMed, but also from Twitter, it’s become one of the sources of getting science stories. Beyond that, it’s a platform where you can reach many people. In my case, I went from, for example, having 3000 followers before the Nobel Prize to now approaching 30,000. It’s a pretty big jump. I guess I’m a nano influencer now because science is still a smaller market than the general public. I overall like it. I think there’s lots of positivity there. If someone is having a tough time in science, they talk about it. They seem to get amazing positive support. It’s also important to highlight that science has to be and can be fun, we do things outside of science that we enjoy and it’s just total representation of what a scientist is and does these days. It’s not to be taken too seriously. It’s just meant to be my state of mind, whether it’s talking about science or any of the other things I’m interested in.;507;Creativity
Besides having more Twitter followers, has your life changed in any other ways since you became a laureate. Have you noticed anything that has changed since that happened?;"There’s a lot more attention paid, on Twitter I have to be more careful. But I think I’m trying to make the best out of it. One of the things that my wife Nancy and I have talked about is that we really liked our lives before the Nobel Prize. Part of me doesn’t want to change that too much because I want to still come to lab every day, interact with the young scientists in my lab and mostly do science. At the same time, this attention makes you realise, I don’t want to say responsibility, but the opportunity to do more than that. Again, I don’t tweet to do this for example, but when I do, and I see people be inspired that they can do this as well that gives me amazing satisfaction to try to do that.
I’m dealing with lots of more invitations to visit amazing places in the world, which is a good thing. I am also trying to keep my old rule of only 12 visits a year to places so that I can still focus on science. Honestly, it’s a work in progress. I’m still trying to think of how I want to use this new opportunity. I think immigration and science is an important aspect to me. My Armenian origin is important to me, and this will be some of the aspects that I will talk more about and get involved in and try to get science blossoming in countries that haven’t had the opportunity is one of the long-term goals.";507;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I can’t leave you without asking a question about this touching moment that you shared on Twitter, the picture depicting you and your son when you got the announcement call. Can you tell us a bit about that moment?;Yeah, it was a touching moment, as you say. I had my phone on do not disturb so I didn’t receive the three or four phone calls from Stockholm at two in the morning. They reached my 94-year-old father who then was able to call me and tell me that I should pay attention to this. As soon as this happened, we had literally one minute before the public announcement. My wife Nancy woke up my son Luca who came in and we wouldn’t even have thought about it but someone from the Nobel Foundation said we would love to have an image as soon as possible of a reaction. This was a genuine moment where I had just opened the laptop to see the live announcement and Luca was sitting next to me. When he saw my name, that’s exactly when the photo was snapped by Nancy, my wife. He was kind of excited and touching my shoulder. It was an in-the-moment shot that turned out great. As I said in my Nobel lecture, traditionally when you win the Nobel all these cameras come to your home and because of COVID, we didn’t have any of that. This picture kind of became the main way I shared this with the rest of the world. I am very fond of that moment. I’m glad it’s captured.;507;Impact of Nobel on you
What does it mean for you to receive the Nobel Prize?;It’s such an unimagined honour. It’s not something I strove for, or thought would be possible in a clinical type of research. So it was nice that they recognised that this clinical piece was important. But I think any prize, and this one the most, is an acknowledgement that your peers respect what you did and think it was good. I always wondered how good it really was.;508;Impact of the Nobel on you
Has it impacted your life already?;Yes, it’s turned it over. I decided to just enjoy it but there’s a huge burden that comes with it. Nice things but the number of emails and cards and things like that are enormous and I want to answer every one of them. I’ve answered hundreds already. But my, like my speeches, my answers are lot. Somebody says congratulations, I write back a paragraph. So I still have piles of people to answer. So that’s been a burden, but nice!;508;Impact of Nobel prize on you
As a Nobel Laureate you will be a great source of inspiration for many people. Who inspired you when you were younger?;"I learned something from everybody. I think my father in retrospect was a big inspiration because of his love of science, and he was a smart guy who to me could do anything. I’m kind of a gadget person, I can fix things and he was like that whatever it was he could fix it.
From Dr. Blumberg, I learnt persistence because he could have dropped this thing at any point. It was kind of bizarre finding this antigen. But he kept at it – he made a lot of wrong hypotheses and when they failed, he’d go to another one. And he kept at it and it proved to be the hepatitis B virus, and he got the Nobel Prize. So persistence was something I learned from him.
But every one of my mentors, every one of my collaborators taught me. And I had great bosses. I had bosses who were not into my research but who were so supportive to allow me to do it and to go to their higher ups to get funding to keep it going.
So for young people, I say, fine go to the best institution that you can get into. Find a mentor who wants more than just your hands. Somebody who wants to foster your career. It’s not easy to find that person, it’s not easy to start out. You know you can’t just start out de novo and have a great experiment. But if you go into somebody else’s lab and you find your own niche. I think that’s a good way to start out.";508;Mentors (Role models)
Did you have an early passion for science and research?;"The short answer is no. I think I leant towards science for a couple of reasons … My father was very interested in science. He was not a doctor or scientist, but he was always reading science. He liked that, he didn’t like TV. So I had that influence.
And as a Jewish boy in New York it is kind of in your genes that you’re going to be a doctor. So that was in the background. But then I found in high school I really liked biology better than other things. I wasn’t good in math, I wasn’t going to be an engineer. So medicine was the natural place to go. And then when I got into med school, I loved it.";508;Motivation
What is the most stimulating part of your work?;It’s always fun. I’m a pretty collegial person. I worked with really brilliant people and so we had fun, I enjoyed coming to work every day. And I liked seeing patients, I could see patients and do research at the same time. It was always enjoyable, and there weren’t too many setbacks. You know the only setback was we couldn’t actually find the [Hepatitis C] virus per se.;508;Free time
So a lot of the enjoyment is collaborations and interactions with other people?;Yes, the NIH is such a unique place. Not only does it allow you time for things to play out, but it’s not competitive, everybody does their own thing. But if you have a question, there’s always somebody there who has some expertise that will help you.;508;Creativity
Looking back at your life, what advice would you give the young Harvey? Would you tell him to take the same path as you have done – going into medical research rather than practice?;Yeah, definitely. And that wasn’t a path I planned to take. But once it happened, I couldn’t have had a better path, I don’t think I would have been happy in practice. I think I’m a good doctor, but the way you practice now you have to see patients so fast and there is also paperwork. At NIH, because I didn’t have a huge number of patients, I could see them, spend time with them, that’s what I enjoyed. And, you know, patients really appreciate when you give them time, they prefer that to good medicine.;508;Advice for young scientists
Is it rewarding to see the direct results of your research by working with patients?;For me that was yes. I wanted to work in clinical practice, but didn’t go that way. But to still see patients but see them in the context of research and to bring something to conclusion in a paper and then go on to the next. You can’t have a better life.;508;Meaning (Values) of Work
It must be nice to say there is nothing you would change in your career path.;"I had to be lucky too you know. The first person I worked with we happened to find the Australia antigen [Hepatitis B] while looking for something else. So serendipity and luck – finding that antigen is what got me back to pursue it further. If that hadn’t happened, I would have still been in practice.
So you know I can’t say to a young person, well, you go and you work hard, you’re going to get a Nobel Prize – you can’t predict that. But you won’t get it if you don’t work hard – I can say that. And you won’t get it if you don’t observe things well and you don’t collaborate well.";508;Future research
What advice would you give to a young researcher who is thinking of pursuing a career in science? Is it worth it?;Oh, yeah, I’d say it’s worth it. I think you have to try to find a balance between family and work. I didn’t find a very good balance for a long, long time. And then there are a lot of perks in academic medicine, you get invited to talk and go to wonderful places, you get treated well. So if you are lucky enough to find something or become an expert in some field, then there’s a lot of perks to it as well. But I would, if I could do it over again, spend more time with my family.;508;Advice for young researchers
You read a poem about frustration in your Nobel Lecture. Can you tell us a little more about your interest in poetry?;"I use humour in my talks, and much more than I used in the Nobel talk. I found poetry goes over very well. I started writing poems when people left the blood bank, they retired, they went to another job. And I would write a poem based around their name. And they were always very popular.
Actually I was at a meeting once in Rochester, New York, this is way, way back. About three speeches ahead of me guy gave a brilliant poem about cleaning the red blood cells. So I quickly scribbled down a four line poem so when my turn, I had a poem in response to his poem. And that went over well. Then I started writing poems for my talks, and I was a poet laureate of the transfusion world. And I became a poet laureate of hepatitis.";508;Creativity
So humour has been important to you in your work?;"For me it has been. Humour has been a way to get along with people, to teach, to collaborate. I’m not a stand up comic but funny things come into my head.
I have a good way with people and humour helps that. If you have a good way with people it’s more fun to work with them so it all ties up. Not only in work but in relationships … [my wife and I] both got woken up by the Nobel call and when I finally got back to bed she’d fallen back to sleep and I said: ‘That was Stockholm calling and I won the Nobel Prize.’ And she said, ‘Stop joking!’";508;Creativity
That’s a problem when you tell a lot of jokes! Do you also cope well with failure and mistakes?;No! I don’t like to fail. I felt very secure at NIH so I never sought going into a new environment or starting over or becoming a Chief of Medicine. Position didn’t mean anything to me. Comfort meant a lot to me. I always thought if you’re happy where you are, why move, why change? Part of that was the fear of going somewhere and failing. I was already doing ok and I didn’t want to jeopardise that.;508;Creativity
The Nobel Prize is given to a person who has achieved the greatest benefit of humankind. What would you say that the greatest benefit to humankind has been with your work?;Well my work, as a piece of a lot of people’s work, has eradicated post-transfusion hepatitis. And it looks like there’s no other agent out there of a hepatitis variety. And then, by leading to treatments of which I had nothing to do with, that are now 100% effective virtually and have no side effects – they’re amazing. So almost every patient I had has been treated now. We’ve got about 10 or 12 more to treat. And to see them so happy … it’s had a huge impact. And there’s still millions and millions of people that are silent carriers of hepatitis C that need to get treated.;508;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Is there a discovery that you wish you had made?;I would have liked to do the cloning of Hepatitis C! I would have liked to write a really good book, not a science book, a good novel.;508;Career Devleopment
What would the title of your book be?;I haven’t thought about that. I can give you my epitaph – I’ve written that! It will be: ‘As in life, he ran out of time.’;508;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
What did you want to be when you were younger? Did you want to be a scientist?;"Yes, I did. At high school I was interested in biology. I was interested in physics. So when I got my A-levels, I was trying to figure out what to do: physics or biology. But I didn’t get a very good grade in my physics A-level. So I thought, ‘Well maybe I’m not going to be too good at that’.
I went to the local library where I lived and looked at all the various career choices. I spent a week in the library thinking seriously about what career I wanted. I got to ‘M’ – microbiology – and I read about Louis Pasteur’s work and his life story. And then I thought, this is what I want to do. That was when I think I decided I was going to do medical research.";509;Motivation
What was it about Louis Pasteur’s story that spoke to you?;I think two things. His daughter died of bacterial disease so obviously with his work, he was able to prevent that in so many people. There was that medical innovation and altruistic aspect to his life along with his tragedy. But also it was very interesting to actually study the mechanism of bacteria and life organisms in general. I was very interested in the difference between an organism and a rock. I found the organism much more interesting than the rock. As you change and develop through life, you realise rocks are very interesting, you can get a lot of information from rocks! But at the time I was more interested in living organisms than physical objects.;509;Creativity
Besides Louis Pasteur was there any other person in your life, perhaps a teacher or mentor, that influenced you to take the path you went down?;Not really but growing up in England, when the structure of DNA was elucidated in that magnificent work by Watson, Crick and Wilkins, the BBC ran programmes about it on Sunday mornings. I used to get up quite early on Sunday mornings just to watch it. That really influenced me too. I knew I wanted to do biology and medical research. And I also knew from listening to those programmes that I wanted to get involved with gene regulation – what these days is termed molecular medicine.;509;Mentor(Role Models)
And that’s what you were interested in at university. What type of student were you? Were you very studious?;I started off studious for the first two terms, but then after that, I discovered a lot of interesting things to do socially! The usual student things – I played a lot of sport, drank a lot of beer and just enjoyed a much freer community for the first time in my life. I went to a traditional high school in the UK where you were told what to do, and often what to think. So being released into a really open community at the University of East Anglia, I wouldn’t say I went off the rails, but it was an important period of growth for me. But actually the work suffered!;509;Life
Looking back is there any advice that you would give to yourself, or that you like to give to students who are starting to think about their career?;"I feel like it’s very important to find what your passion is in life, find out what you’re really motivated to do, and it doesn’t matter what it is. It could be a ballet dancer. It could be a travel writer, but find out what really motivates you. Secondly spend a lot of effort on finding out because I think a lot of young people drift from one thing to another, to another. It’s okay to change but I think you’ve got to put a lot of thought into what you really want to do, and you’ve got to put some effort into that. It’s not an easy decision.
So in summary – find what you’re passionate about, find out what your vocation is and spend time and spend the effort to do that.";509;Advice  for young scientists
What makes you passionate about science and your work?;"I like the idea of looking at disease and then working with other scientists to figure out ways to prevent that disease. I work at the level of molecular medicine, and there’s a lot of tools available to us now, a lot of methodologies and a lot of technology we can bring to diseases. I very much like exploring ways to solve disease. We have so many diseases that affect humans.
Although we’ve made progress, I don’t think it’s good enough. There are too many diseases that humans suffer from about which we know very little – Alzheimer’s, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis. Cancer of course gets a lot of effort and there has been some progress there, but there are so many diseases that really afflict mankind that I feel we should be doing a better job on.";509;Motivation
How does it feel to do work that has such a tangible impact on people’s lives?;"It’s great. After our discovery of the hepatitis C virus, I organised an international meeting on the disease with a colleague in Italy. I remember sitting in the audience during the conference and hepatitis C virus was up there on the screen. And I thought, wow finally we’ve been able to identify a field and to have people all over the world, working on it, to actually help patients. That was a good feeling.
But it took us a lot of effort to find the virus, the best part of seven years. When you’ve been trying so, so long, so hard, it was very satisfying after spending so much work and effort. And there was a fair bit of pressure. It was done in a biotech company where the investors are always asking when, when, when, where’s the virus?
But the bottom line is if you can impact disease and prevent disease in patients, that’s what medicine is all about. Whether you’re a clinician or whether you’re a medical researcher, like me, that’s the most important thing. Everything else is just icing on the cake.";509;Meaning(Values) of Work
You mentioned that discovering hepatitis C took a lot of persistence. What qualities do you think are important to be a successful scientist?;"I think for me, it’s working with good people. I think that’s important because you can kick ideas around with each other and often the best ideas come from chance, random conversations. You schedule meetings all the time to update progress and review problems, but it’s really the conversations around the coffee pot at work, or sometimes over lunch. It’s environments that are not scheduled that really stimulate the germ of, ‘well, okay, this is a direction we should take’.
I think number two is, as I said before, being very passionate about what you’re doing, because that gives you determination and that gives you the persistence. Persistence is very important.
What else? Good old fashioned hard work and getting the funding. It’s not easy getting funding for something like hepatitis C – seven years without making any progress. That’s tough to do in academia and it’s tough in industry because people want returns quite quickly.
So working with good people, persistence, determination, and don’t give up. If you think you have a good chance, a reasonable chance, don’t give up.";509;Competencies
How did you manage to convince your company to keep going then?;"That’s a great question. I think you always get conflicting opinions in any group of humans. Some people think it’s time to stop the program. Some people think even if we don’t discover it, we’ll be there and able to contribute to the growth of the field and in some way make a contribution, medically and commercially. And then other people feel, like I did, that it’s worth the effort. What else could I be doing that has the potential of trying to discover the hepatitis C virus?
So there’s a whole range of different emotions. There’s the commercial, there’s the impatience, and then there’s the philosophical: ‘what else could I be doing that was more important than trying to find a major virus?’";509;Creativity
What keeps you going, when you encounter problems or failure?;"I think first of all you’ve got to believe with realism that you have a real chance. You don’t want people trying to become astronauts and going to Mars if they don’t like heights! That’s an extreme example, but you’ve got to believe with some reality that you have a chance to do it.
If you feel confidence that you can do it when you have setbacks, which we had all the time for seven years. I was very philosophical about it. When colleagues showed me disappointing data often I would laugh and say, ‘Well, okay, that’s too bad. Let’s try something else.’ So good old human traits of confidence and persistence, that’s part of what the human race has, doesn’t it?";509;Creativity
And outside of science how do you like to spend your free time? Is there something you do to feel more creative or relax?;"I played a lot of sports since the age of four actually, so I love sport. I love cricket, it’s my favorite game. I used to play a lot of it at high school and at college and afterwards. Nowadays I just watch it!
And I’m interested in the world around us. We’re all on a learning curve. We’re still trying to figure out what we are and where we are. I read books on physics. I read books on cosmology. I’m very interested in understanding who we are. A sort of philosopher I suppose like millions of human beings – we’re trying to figure out what we are.";509;Free time
Why did you decide to pursue science?;I think it’s really just fundamental curiosity. I’ve always been interested in sort of nature, biology and the outdoors, amongst many other things. So I think I was somewhat unfocused coming out of my early education. And that was certainly the case when I went to college. I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do.;510;Motivation
Were there any defining moments that influenced your career?;"There were really just a series of experiences. One of them was just a really talented teacher of an introductory biology class, Dennis Barrett, who just really was a great teacher and got the class motivated and got people interacting with each other to sort of discuss different aspects of concepts that he was trying to get across. I think that connection really sort of changed my life in a sense because we actually became pretty good friends and I did some research as an undergraduate with him.
Then he actually sort of guided me towards going to the Marine biology laboratory in Massachusetts. This was a summer program for very young science learning (sort of) trainees. I did this in between my junior and senior year. It was just an amazing experience because it was basically several months in the summer where you’re just doing nothing but listening to the scientists, that are hanging out in Woods Hole (which is a nice place to spend the summer) and sort of listening to lectures, spending a lot of time in the lab, just experiencing different kinds of research techniques ranging from biophysical things to immunology and other stuff. It was a life changing experience, but I still wasn’t a hundred percent sure that I wanted to do research when I graduated from college. So I kind of wandered in central and South America because I was also growing up in California. You get exposed to a lot Spanish speaking people so I was kind of a Spanish literature minor in college. I decided to just take some time off and I applied to graduate school and then basically took off on the road and became a vagabond for the better part of a year, and then ended up returning to go to graduate school.";510;Mentors (Role models)
Were there more reasons for why you became a scientist?;It was really those experiences in college I think that got me hooked on research and then the experience of actually doing a PhD at a fantastic institution with a great group of peers and role models at Caltech. I was hooked and that was another random occurrence in the sense that I was really interested in fundamental sort of developmental biology, what happens when an egg gets fertilised and sort of early events in embryogenesis. Then I ended up, when I arrived at Caltech, getting placed in a biology lab instead of a developmental biology lab. And that was that. I enjoyed it and just sort of kept working on viruses from that time on and throughout my career.;510;Motivation
How do you deal with failure?;"Well, I don’t know. It sort of depends on how you view failure, because I guess there are different degrees of failure. I mean, one is that you sort of designed an experiment and then you just screwed it up. There was some sort of technical glitch or whatever that makes the results uninterpretable and if you can identify that and troubleshoot and then get the experiment back on track so that you get an answer that you can believe in – that’s part of the scientific process. But even when an experiment works, you have probably an idea as to what the expected outcome is going to be. If it’s a hypothesis driven experiment and the results don’t often support your hypothesis so you may end up with a well-executed experiment, really nice data and it’s just unexpected and you don’t know how to explain those results.
I guess there are two sorts of mentalities when you’re sort of confronted with that situation. One is, ‘Oh, these results don’t fit my hypothesis, I’m going to just give up.’ The other mentality is, ‘Well, this is a well-executed experiment, I’ve got the right controls. It’s giving me an answer that I didn’t expect.’ And that is, I think, the greatest opportunity in science – to actually view a result and you can either view it as failure or something unexpected and an opportunity. I think that the results of an initial experiment are usually not the end of the sort of investigation there, they’re more of the beginning. So maybe [failure] is a matter of semantics in a way and a matter of perception.";510;Creativity
What advice do you usually give to young researchers?;"I think to really make an advance is hard work. I think to be a successful scientist, you almost have to deal with our vocation as not a job as it’s more of a hobby and that we’re fortunately allowed to continue at least to some extent, depending upon what the funding agencies will let us get away with. So I think you have to have a passion for what you’re doing, so that some of these results they could be discouraging now, you just take them as a matter of course and move on. I think it’s hard work, but if it’s work for you, then you should probably do something else.
I think the successful scientists are really doing it because they’re curious and they’re doing this because there’s nothing else we’d rather be doing. I guess we sometimes get called workaholics or things like that. I would say maybe we’re more hobbyholics in the sense that we have been fortunate enough to have what we get paid to do as our hobby. I think that’s, to me, the sort of guiding principle for young scientists. You want to try and find something that you have a passion for, and then really just sort of follow that.";510;Advice for young scientists
Do you have a lot of pets?;"I am a dog fan. I’m an only child, so I didn’t have brothers and sisters but I had a continuous series of dogs from the time that I was a little boy. One of the pictures that I still have is something that my parents had taken with me when I was, I think, three years old and a basket with a bunch of puppies.
Today we have two dogs. We have a fairly dog-friendly campus here so the students that live on campus can have dogs and the sort of housing that we have right next to campus is pet friendly. My dogs sometimes come in here to the office.";510;Life
What do you like to do in your spare time?;I like the outdoors. We try and get away to a hideaway and a mountain range in Wyoming. We drive out there with the dogs. It’s about a 31 hour track to get to this spot. But it’s about as different as you can imagine from Manhattan. A log cabin that is, 15 miles away from the nearest paved road that’s completely surrounded by undeveloped land that is controlled by the forest service. The dogs of course love this. The only thing we have to contend with is that it does sort of overlap with some cattle grazing rights so that some of the folks that raise cattle allow them to graze in this area. That can create some issues with the dogs who sometimes take an interest in these cows when they’re not supposed to.;510;Free time
How did you receive the news about your Nobel Prize?;"It was a phone call from the committee secretary. I was by myself here in New York and the call came on a landline at 4:30 in the morning. I was completely asleep. I couldn’t imagine who would be calling me at 4:30 and I got up to sort of go out there and pick it up and yell at whoever was calling me. Then I thought, ‘Oh, it’s just gotta be somebody that hit the wrong number or whatever.’ So I turned around to go back to bed and it stopped ringing and then it started again, and then I kind of stormed into the living room and it was pitch black and I grabbed the phone, which didn’t have a lit dial.
I don’t use this phone very often. I knew there was a connect button and a disconnect button, but I didn’t really know which one I was pushing, but I guess it was the connect button. As a consequence of that the secretary came on the phone and there was this voice with a sort of Swedish accent and it still just really didn’t dawn on me until he said more about the fact that this had to do with hepatitis C and Nobel Prize and Harvey Alter and Michael Houghton. And I thought, ‘Oh, this is beginning to sound like it might be real.’ It was quite an awakening. After something like that, you don’t go back to sleep.";510;Impact of Nobel on you
Was it your dream to be a Nobel Laureate?;Was this my dream to become a Nobel Laureate when I was a child? To be honest, when I was a child, I had heard of this prize and I think like many people, it quickly takes on sort of this mythological proportion. Like a lot of children growing up in the sixties, I had an interest in science and engineering because of the space race. I had a lot of toys that fostered an interest in science, one of which I’m going to donate to the museum today. I remember hearing a scientist speak for the first time, who visited my elementary school when I was in the fifth grade. I think there was a little part of my brain that imagined I might eventually become a scientist. I think I did have a little part of my brain that dreamt maybe what would it be like to win a Nobel Prize one day.;511;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How did you decide to pursue medical research?;"As a young boy, my favourite subject was mathematics, because mathematics to me was a subject where you didn’t have to study very much. If you understood the concept, you understood the concept and it stayed with you. I didn’t particularly like courses where you had to take the books home and memorise lots of facts and information. I loved mathematics initially, and then later when computers came along, I became interested in computer science because I thought that was a way of applying math in everyday life. But I’m embarrassed to say, I wasn’t Bill Gates and I wasn’t Steve Jobs, I didn’t see the personal computer revolution that was going to eventually come. I didn’t imagine smartphones. I couldn’t imagine a career in computer science, and I frankly didn’t think I was quite gifted enough in mathematics to be an academic mathematician. So, I started to look for other ways I could use a mathematical mindset, if you will, and still make a living.
I started to gravitate a little bit more towards science and medicine. Medicine it seemed to me was a way that I could have science and math in my life and use that hopefully for the betterment of mankind. My father growing up was a lawyer, so maybe I was slightly inclined to follow a profession. Now, from watching him, I had decided I didn’t necessarily want to become a lawyer, but I knew there were some benefits to following a profession, and so I decided to pursue medicine.";511;Motivation
How do you deal with failure?;"I think failure comes in different flavours. For example, the first time I attempted to work in a laboratory to do research, I was an undergraduate in college. In hindsight, I now appreciate the project that was given was simply undoable, unimportant and uninteresting, which is a very bad combination for a young person trying to become a scientist. Then during the last month in the laboratory, I correctly told my professor that by doing a little reading, I had determined that this project would never be completed because it was all based on a mistake of one of my predecessors, a so-called artifact. Of course, he rewarded me by giving me a bad grade and telling me I should never work in the laboratory again. That’s one type of failure. The lesson I took from that is, sometimes if you’re struggling in a laboratory the problem might be you, but it might also be the laboratory. But then there’s another type of failure where perhaps you’re having a challenge mastering a particularly sophisticated technique. I think any scientist knows that’s part of the territory. Sometimes you muddle through and you master the technique, or perhaps instead, you identify a collaborator who’s already good at the technique, who can help you get over that barrier.
But the final type of frustration, which I think is the most important one for any young scientist to consider, is that, as you say many times, our guesses and hunches are simply wrong. Sometimes we obtain results that are frankly disappointing given our perhaps prior expectations. But I try to remind especially young scientists that if every time you do an experiment, you get the expected results, you’re probably doing engineering, but you’re not really doing science, and frankly, science would be terribly boring if every time you did an experiment, you got exactly the results you thought you were going to get. In fact, I’ve even gone one step further and said that a good scientist should actually live for unexpected results. Because as you probably well know, there are many, many major discoveries that actually began with a completely unexpected result, where fortunately, there was someone with a receptive mind who decided that they would perhaps pursue this further, even though initially perhaps they couldn’t comprehend the significance of what they were seeing.
In fact, I’ve heard one Nobel Laureate say that many results that might have led to a Nobel Prize probably wind up in the waste paper bin because someone refused to actually look objectively at the data simply because it didn’t conform to their prior expectations. I think what any type of frustration that we’ve talked about, persistence is key. Whether it’s having the persistence to overcome various forms of rejection whether it’s a mentor who doesn’t have confidence in you, as was the case with my first mentor. Whether it’s reviewers and editors telling you your papers are not worthy of publication. Whether it’s a study section rejecting one of your grants. This just goes with the territory, and you have to be persistent, perhaps even a little thick-skinned. But likewise in the laboratory, you have to be persistent because as you know, in science, seldom are things straightforward and linear. There are going to be obstacles to overcome, and occasionally your data will take you off the path you thought you were traveling on into a different area. I think you just have to be persistent and to live for those occasional moments where you do have those ‘eureka moments’ where you suddenly have the privilege of seeing something and understanding something that’s never been seen or understood before. I think knowing that if you’re lucky, you will occasionally have those ‘eureka moments’ that provides you the fuel to get through the frustrating periods.";511;Creativity
What would you advise a young person starting a career in science?;"I would have several pieces of advice. The first thing I would tell them is everything else being equal. I’m a big advocate of focusing on studies that teach you how to think rigorously and clearly and logically, because those things never go out of fashion. You can study and memorise facts and factoids, but sometimes those facts and factoids eventually turn out to be wrong or irrelevant, and they’re often quite specific to various disciplines. Whereas if you take courses that really train you to think clearly, that will serve you well, no matter what you do. For example, I actually didn’t like biology as a young person because at the time biology was quite descriptive and wasn’t particularly mechanistic. I found that terribly boring, whereas I thought courses like mathematics, computer science, and physics were very good for helping me to think clearly and to arrive at answers that were objectively true. I tended to steer away, for example, from some of the subjects that I found overly subjective.
The next thing I would tell them is I think one of the keys to happiness in life is to find something you find so rewarding and so fulfilling, you would do it even if you didn’t need the money, right? Most people go to work every day because they need a roof over their head, and they need food on their table and clothes on their back. I fully understand that, but what a great privilege it is to do a job that you would do even if you didn’t need the money. One of the great joys of my life has been … I discovered I enjoyed science so much I would do it even if I wasn’t getting paid. In fact, there are many times I feel guilty I’m getting paid to do this because it feels like I’m playing rather than working. I think if you can find such a thing, I think that’s priceless. If you have any interest in science whatsoever, I would give it a chance and find out whether you really enjoy it. Because I think it is such a great privilege to do something where you come to work every day, you’re surrounded by bright people, and you get to follow your curiosity, and if you’re lucky, occasionally actually discover something useful.";511;Advice for young researchers
How did you react when you heard you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;The night before, someone asked me whether I would be able to sleep knowing that the following morning would be the announcement of the Nobel Prize. I told them that I thought I would sleep quite well, because I thought that the chance of winning was no greater than one or two percent, maybe even that was optimistic. I said, at one to two percent, I’ll be able to sleep tonight, but at one to two percent, I will leave my phone ringer on, on my bedside table, which I don’t normally do. I went to bed at the normal hour, and I had a very vivid dream where I looked at the alarm clock, and the time had already passed when I would’ve gotten the phone call. In my dream, I was already rationalising why this might even be a good thing. I was happy before, I’ll be happy now, and now I can go back to my work without this distraction. Then I unfortunately woke up from my dream and saw that the alarm clock said 2:00 a.m. and I said to myself, I have to do this all over again and go back to sleep. Then the phone rang at 4:40 a.m. and at that point, first of all, I was again wondering, is this now a dream? Or is this now reality? It was almost, I’ve described it as almost like an out-of-body experience, because I’m listening to this lovely gentleman with a Swedish accent telling me I’ve won the Nobel Prize. It was like overwhelming emotions of just gratitude and the overwhelming sense of what a privileged life I’ve had because so much luck goes into this. Clearly this is a dream for so many scientists. To think I now have the privilege of being a Nobel Laureate, it was just quite overwhelming. My next thought was how wonderful it was going to be to share this with all the important people in my life who’ve made it possible.;511;Impact of Nobel on you
Can you explain your Nobel Prize-awarded discovery?;I think most people are aware that you need oxygen to live, but less appreciated is the fact that too much oxygen would also be quite toxic and potentially lethal. All of the animals on the planet, including us, had to evolve a system that would allow the cells and tissues to know whether they were getting enough oxygen and to respond accordingly. So just as you might have a thermostat in your room to adjust the temperature properly, your cells need a system to adjust how much oxygen they’re being exposed to. It turns out precisely because oxygen is important, there are many human diseases where part of the problem is inadequate oxygen delivery to a tissue, such as in a heart attack or a stroke. Those two diseases are caused because the heart or the brain are not getting enough blood and hence are not getting enough oxygen. We also know that cancers, in order to grow, have to obtain oxygen. We now understand how in some cases they’ve hijacked the system that we use to sense and adapt to oxygen for their own evil purposes, so that they can trick the body into providing them with an oxygen supply.;511;Meaning(Values) of Work
Where are we today in understanding cancer?;"It started to become clear in the middle to the late part of the last century that cancers arose because of alterations, or scientists called them mutations in specific genes. But frankly, until the year 2000, we didn’t have the complete list of human genes, and we didn’t even know what the normal sequences of those genes were. It had always occurred to me back in the 1980s, when I was still a doctor taking care of cancer patients, that treating cancer was a little bit like trying to fix the engine of your car with a hammer. We really needed to understand this disease much better. Fortunately, in the year 2000, we finally obtained the complete list of human genes and their normal sequences that allowed us for the first time to start to understand which genes are altered or again, mutated in specific cancers, and then to start to use that information to develop better, more targeted, more precise drugs. I think we’re in a phase now where things are starting to accelerate, because we’re starting to reap the harvest of that knowledge that started to emerge in the year 2000.
More and more now we have new treatments for cancer that are helping many, many patients. But along the way, we’ve learned that no two types of cancer are genetically identical. Even within a given type of cancer, such as breast cancer, the cancer for one patient might be genetically dissimilar from another breast cancer. That’s why progress is sometimes frustratingly slow. I don’t think there’s going to be a single magic bullet that will cure all cancers. I think we have to continue to methodically make progress on all of the different cancers because as I said, sometimes the treatment for one cancer might not be applicable at all to another because of their different genetic makeup.";511;Meaning(Values) of Work
What are your thoughts on how science is perceived today?;"One source of great sadness and concern for me is this trend in certain quarters to disparage science and to disparage expertise. I was born in 1957, which was the year of Sputnik, so when I grew up as a young boy in the sixties in the New York area, the scientists and engineers, they were the heroes. I can remember going to ticker-tape parades for the returning astronauts. Like a lot of young children at the time, especially, unfortunately it was mostly young boys at the time, I had a chemistry set and a microscope and electric cars and a rock collection and a number of things that I think indirectly or directly were fostering an interest in science and engineering. I think for most of my adult life there was great support for investments in science because I think it was held as indisputable that creating new knowledge was intrinsically good, and that this was a gift we gave to ourselves and to future generations.
Now increasingly, at least again, in certain quarters, you hear people disparage science, especially when they don’t like the conclusions of the scientist. For example, I think about the current debate, and it’s sad that I even have to use the word debate because it’s no longer debatable, but when you hear a certain climate change, deniers make comments about science as though you get to pick and choose what the data tells you. You simply can ignore if it’s expedient to do so, what the best minds in the world are telling you you should be doing. I think we do this at great peril, and I think this is simply a road to the dark ages. If the pendulum shifts to the point where expertise is a bad thing, and we no longer celebrate science and engineering.";511;Creativity

What was your childhood like?;Gregg Semenza: I have two brothers and two sisters, so we have a large family and especially when we were young of course that involved a lot of chaos, and we had a lot of freedom at that time. Children now seem to have very scripted lives and whereas we had a lot of freedom. Basically, we go out of the house in the morning, at say in the summertime and you come back in the evening for dinner and nobody is expecting to see you in between so, y it was a lot of fun to grow in that kind of an environment.;513;Life
Was there a particular teacher that inspired you?;Gregg Semenza: For my carrier inspiration, I was very fortunate to have a high school biology teacher, a Dr Rose Nelson and she was a PhD, so she had done research, she had done post-doctoral training and she taught us biology, not as a series of sort of facts but she would teach us about discoveries and about scientist who made discoveries and sort of the excitement of learning something new in science. And that really excited me. She also recommended to me a summer programme at a research institute where I was able to experience research firsthand. All those experiences really, really excited me and developed a passion in science that I have had ever since, so I really owe that to her. It’s one of my regrets that she passed away before this time because she was a very, very positive person and very abluent, joyful, she always had a beatific smile on her face and she would be teaching us something and she would say,:“Now, I want you to remember that when you win your Nobel Prize that you learned that here”. And she said this, not to me, but to the class and she would say this as a statement of fact, so I don’t know how she knew, but she was really a remarkable teacher.;513;Mentors (Role models)
Why did you become interested in genetics?;Gregg Semenza: I guess the idea of hereditary passing down of traits and how this was determined by sequences within the DNA. It’s kind of a very amazing thing to go from these molecules to traits of living organisms and that really interested me. I was first interested in genetics, sort of basic genetics and thought I would do basic genetic research, but while I was in college, a family that we knew had a child born with Down syndrome and I became interested in medical genetics, and decided that I would try to get training both as a MD and a PhD, so that I could do both genetics research and medical genetics as a clinical specialty.;513;Motivation
How do you deal with failure?;"Gregg Semenza: When I was a college student I worked in a lab in Boston and the leader of the lab, he would always say: “Search and research”, because that’s the nature of science. There are always obstacles to be overcome, experimentally, and that’s a challenge and if that isn’t something that is enjoyable to you then probably science is not a good line of work because we are constantly faced with those kinds of obstacles and challenges. And part of the fun of the work is using our creativity to come up with solutions to those kinds of problems when they arise.
Persistence is a very critical attribute, absolutely, and then the other part of it that is very helpful, is to have colleagues who take orthogonal approaches to the science. They may look at the science in a slightly different way and may provide an avenue for circumventing various obstacles. When we were trying to isolate the DNA sequences that coded for the subunits of hypoxia-inducible factors we took one approach because we thought that there was only one protein that was involved, and we took an approach that involved screening human DNA sequences in bacteriophage and we screened millions and millions of these clones, and we got negative results. As a leader of the research project, it’s sort of my role to decide what to do. We could continue doing what we were doing – that didn’t seem like a very good idea. We could give up and let someone else do it – that didn’t seem like a very good idea either. Or we could take a completely different approach which was rather than a molecular genetic approach to take a biochemical approach and try to purify the protein through biochemistry. And this was not exactly our foretake, we owned none of the equipment that was required for purify proteins, did not really have the expertise to do that, but fortunately, across the street at Johns Hopkins was the lab of Tom Kelly and his lab was one of the first labs to purify a protein based on its binding to DNA. With the assistance of his lab, we were able to do that, to purify the protein from a hundred leaders of cells, growing in culture and to get just enough of the protein that we could obtain some protein sequence and then use that protein sequence to identify the DNA sequences of what turned out to be the two subunits of the protein. So, in fact the approach that we had been taking would never have worked because that approach only works if the protein has the single subunit and because our protein turned out to have two different subunits only through the purification, the biochemical purification, would we have been able to succeed.";513;Creativity
How important in freedom in science?;Gregg Semenza: The freedom and the creativity, these are the really fun parts of the job that no one tells us how to do our work and as long as we are successful, we are left alone and we can do our thing. To have that freedom to, not only with regards to problem solving, but even more fundamentally, what questions do we ask, what are the really important questions that we would like to answer. That’s left entirely up to us and obviously that changes over time. So, we started with more basic, fundamental questions and then over time have shifted to more applied applications as the project has evolved. That’s been very satisfying over the course of thirty years, to be able to connect the dots to very molecular fundamental questions: how does the cell sense the oxygen concentration and respond to changes all the way to … can we develop new treatments for anaemia, for cancer, for cardiovascular disease. And as someone trained both in research and medicine, for me, I’ve always thought it’s my role to bridge between the basic science and the clinical translation and it has been very satisfying to reach that point where we see these translations occurring now as a result of these basic discoveries that were made 25 years ago.;513;Diversity in Science
Have you ever doubted yourself?;Gregg Semenza: That’s a good question. I guess I doubt myself often. I often doubt, you know, am I taking the best approach? Am I running the lab most efficiently? Am I mentoring my students well enough, could I be doing a better job with that? I guess I have those kind of doubts or self-criticism on a fairy regular basis.;513;Creativity
How did you discover you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Gregg Semenza: I think the word is dumbfounded. It was of course in the US and it was in the middle of the night and I was sleeping very soundly, and the phone rang and when I finally was awoken out of the sleep and got to the phone in the hallway it had stopped ringing. I was not even really awake yet and I figured, well, maybe this is somebodies’ idea of a bad joke, because I did know what day it was. So I went back to sleep and actually quite a while later the phone rang again, I said: “Perhaps I‘d better be quicker this time”. So I got to the phone and Thomas Perlmann apologized for waking me up and then gave the good news and I was sort of on the phone and my jaw just dropped and I didn’t really … words weren’t coming out. Of course, my wife was there, and she could hear what was being said on the phone and her jaw dropped and she couldn’t say much either, we were just kind of mute. It was a very one-sided conversation.;513;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Can you explain your Nobel Prize-awarded discovery?;Gregg Semenza: Everybody appreciates the importance of oxygen. You just have to hold your breath and you’ll start feeling uncomfortable very soon, because you have a hundred trillion cells in your body, and they all need oxygen on a continuous basis. Principally to make energy, which allows us to … for this complex organism to function. The body uses glucose and oxygen in order to generate energy. By the same token, oxygen at too higher levels causes damage to cells, so there has to be a very tight coordination between supply and demand. The amount of oxygen that each cell requires, has to be matched by the delivery of oxygen which is of course carried by red blood cells through the blood vessels to each cell. There is a beautiful physiological system that maintains the balance between consumption and delivery of oxygen in every one of the hundred trillion cells in your body under normal healthy conditions and if that balance is disturbed by many common diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer.;513;Meaning(Values) of Work
What practical applications does your work have?;"Gregg Semenza: The first translation of the discovery of this system to the clinic is the development of new drugs for the treatment of anemia. We started by studying the hormone that controls red blood cell production, called erythropoietin, or EPO. Patients who have a chronic kidney disease, their kidneys stop making EPO and they become anemic. The discovery of EPO was a revolution because it enabled the patients to receive a recombinant EPO protein as an injection, to stimulate red blood cell production. Of course it’s a recombinant protein and it has to be injected and now there are in development drugs that induce the activity of the factors that we identified, the hypoxia-inducible factors that control EPO production, and these drugs can be given as pills by mouth. The treatment of anemia can be made much more convenient for patients, both with kidney disease and other causes of anemia. And there are four different drugs that are all in advanced clinical trials now, over 25,000 patients are being studied in these trials and one of the drugs has already been proved for use in China and Japan and will probably be approved in the US and in Europe within the next year, if everything goes well. That will be the first application of our discoveries to the clinic.
Another area in that context, the hypoxia-inducible factors are, as I said, play an important role in physiology and when they are not produced in sufficient amounts, we want to stimulate that. But in cancer, the factors are produced at very high amounts because oxygen becomes very limiting in cancers because the cells grows so rapidly that they basically outgrow their blood supply and become very hypoxic. And this can lead in fact to the cancer cells dying because they don’t have enough oxygen, which, of course, you can say what is bad about that, that’s what we like cancer cells to do, to die, but of course, the cells that are very far away die, but those that are closer, they can survive but their exposure to low oxygen changes them, makes them more invasive and metastatic, more difficult to kill. We believe these cells are really cells that are very dangerous in terms of the risks of the cancer spreading through the body and resisting therapy and pretty much all of the cancer therapies are targeted to cells around blood vessels that have lots of oxygen that are rapidly dividing, whereas the hypoxic cells are not really targeted by any therapy and we think that if we can inhibit the activity of the hypoxic inducible factors in the hypoxic area of the cancers, that will complement the existing therapies and lead to a better outcome for patients with advanced cancer. There is a HIF inhibitor that is now on clinical trials for kidney cancer, so, we’ve already started down that road as well. When I say we I mean the scientific community, the pharmaceutical industry, recognizing the importance of this area for targeting in different diseases.";513;Meaning (Values) of Work
Is there a good balance between basic and applied research in medicine today?;Gregg Semenza: Most applied research comes from a foundation of basic research and what I mean by that is that the basic studies are all often done just trying to understand the system and the properties of that system without directly saying, we want to target this particular disease, because that tends to be less effective than to say, let’s just learn about this system and by doing so, over time it will become apparent how we might target the system therapeutically. That’s how we started, just with very basic fundamental research, and it’s lead now, I think, to many applications. Being apparent that that again will take time to unfold but we’ll hopefully resolve in new treatments for a number of different diseases.;513;Meaning(Values) of Work
What triggered your interest in researching a new cancer therapy?;"My personal experience with cancer did indeed get my attention, let’s put it that way. My mother died when I was about ten years old of lymphoma. I was with her when she passed away and shortly after two of her brothers died of cancer, one of melanoma, the other of lung cancer, so I got to see the ravages of conventional therapies. So I always wanted to do something about cancer, I didn’t really know how. I would say I went into immunology because I was fascinated by immunology, these T cells, they were just discovered when I was in college and these cells grow all over your body and go through tissues and they can detect when something there is not meant to be there. And then they eliminate it. And how do they do that?
At the time there was nothing known about it. I’ve spent the last almost forty years now trying to figure that out. But my approach was that if I can figure that out maybe we can use the knowledge somewhere along the way to think about cancer, going back and treating cancer. That’s the way I approached it. In a way I was doing the work but the idea of ultimately treating cancer… but I was really doing because I wanted to know how T cells work. So it was fundamental research I was interested in, not necessarily the cancer aspect but I was aware, always aware that it was there, you know, if I could just figure out enough, to be smart enough to come up with a new way to do it.";514;Motivation
How does it feel to do work that saves lives?;"After we first got into clinical trials, I had cured a lot of mice in my laboratory, of my own hands. When you cure mice, they bite you and I will stop there, they are not grateful at all, let’s put it that way. Of course we gave them the cancer in the first place so I guess that’s not wrong. But to me, after we started, I could sort of figure out what was going on, sort of understand that it was a good thing but it was mostly numbers to me at first. And then when I had the chance to meet the first patient which was about 2006, actually it was 2004, anyways in that era, it really changed everything. It was a patient named Sharon Belvin. She was 22 years old when she was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, which is basically a death sentence in that time. She had just finished college, gotten engaged, you know, and wanted to start her life and Bam! she gets this diagnosis. So she started on ipilimumab and in a few months her tumours were completely gone. I met her when her doctor called me in New York and called me and said that I’ve got a patient who wants to meet you. She told her “The guy who invented this is here – do you want to meet him?” So she did.
I went over to our patient clinic and walked into this room with her doctor, she and her husband and her parents and it was just … Let’s put it this way; it was a life changing moment. That’s when it first really became clear to me exactly what was going on and I have followed her since then. She’s fourteen years out now, almost 15 years, and has two beautiful children and she told me several years ago, you know she said “They tell me I have this chronic disease that I have to keep an eye on but I say to hell with melanoma, I am done with melanoma. I am cured and I will live my life like I am cured.” And that’s when it really caused me to think about this. It isn’t just a cancer therapy, this is a way of liberating people from the burden of always every day having to be thinking about the fact that you have this disease that can come back and kill you. You are always looking over your shoulder and that’s what she taught me, that takes a bigger tool and patience than I had imagined. A lot of people don’t like to, a lot of conditions don’t want to say that and I do think you ought to be careful because you don’t want an optimism about what is happening, but the statistics on thousands of patients say that if you make it in four years … and this is just metastatic melanoma, you are probably going be good for 10 or more. So people ought to just quit worrying about it and get on with their lives.";514;Meaning(Values) of Work
What is the main impact of your discovery?;"The main impact of our work is to show that you can effectively get your own immune system to attack cancer. It is a very radical departure from the conventional types of cancer therapies, which are radiation, surgery and chemotherapy. All of which is either to remove or kill the cancer cells. What we do has really very little to do with the cancer cell. What I figured out was a molecule that is involved in stopping T cells responses. When you respond to bacteria or cancer you’ve got to generate a huge amount of T cells. So we worked out this pathways by which they get started, but then you’ve got to stop them at some point, or they can damage your body. We had the idea maybe that is why we don’t deal well with cancer, why the immune system doesn’t deal well with cancer. It’s one particular molecule, I thought, if we can pick and inactivate it that is kind of you disable the breaks and you just let the thing keep going for a while but it has nothing to do with cancer. We are not treating the cancer.
So it has really revolutionized how you go about treating cancer where you go in with chemicals or radiation trying to kill every last tumour cell and you know that’s all you can do. But the immune system gives you a way of getting your own T cells to attack the cancer and again, the kind of cancer … You don’t need to design a different thing for every cancer, let’s just put it that way. And once you got the T cells, you got them for the rest of your life, so if the cancer comes back it can immediately rejuvenate and this memory cells can then go after the cancer. So fundamentally it is completely different than conventional therapies. The great thing about it is that it has now become clear that immunotherapy is the fourth pillar of cancer therapy but I like the other three, it can work with them, you can combine it.
And what it is going to do in the next few years, it is starting now so this is going to happen pretty rapidly, as people begin to reevaluate radiation, reevaluate genomically targeted therapies and radiation, and realise that you don’t have to kill every cancer cell. You can just give enough to kill some cancer cells whatever the treatment is and maybe get away from all the adverse events that are associated with those kinds of therapy and give them the benefits, such as memory, of immunotherapy. I would say that is beginning to happen in lung cancers, best examples so far, I think that is going to be happening more and more and I think there are going to be rapid developments pretty soon. But the main thing is again to get durable responses instead of just giving somebody several months, several years or switching drugs or approaches. That is not to say that nothing worked at all until this came along, that is not true. Even if drugs didn’t work by themselves, many types of cancer you can just keep changing them and still keep people alive for long periods of time. But that is not the same as actually curing them.";514;Creativity
Where does your passion for science come from?;"I became committed to science, although it was before I was in the eight grade, because I always liked to have my microscope, chemistry set and just mess around and I liked figuring out things. My dad was a doctor so I was on the way for a while, a little tour, but basically assuming that I was going to be a doctor. I started college as a pre-med major but I had this experience after my junior year in high school, I participated in a science program at the University of Texas at Austin where you as a high school student had lectures in the mornings, which was fantastic, biology teachers, and then worked in labs in the afternoons. For me, it was just like heaven. It was just so much fun. I said this is what I want to do.
I was thinking about it after I matured a little bit and we thought as a doctor you have to, as you are treating people you have to fill your head with facts, just an incredible number of facts and have them in there so when a patient presents to you with a particular set of symptoms you develop an algorithm to treat them and you better be right. Because if you are wrong at the very least you don’t hurt anybody. But as a scientist you are supposed to be wrong, you are supposed to be testing and questioning, saying how does this work? Does it work this way? And if you can figure it out easily and you are right every time you are probably working on boring stuff. If you are right in a big way a few times a year or a few times a decade with really big stuff that’s enough. And so that is the key to be able to identify anything important, questions and follow the experiments down the road. If you are wrong you just keep going. You just learn something. Learn more, every experiment teaches you something. So hopefully you get to the point where you have got something that you can’t prove it is wrong.";514;Motivation
What kind of a student were you?;As a student I think I had a pretty strong will. Not that I was studious or particularly disciplined in my approach to my studies. But I think I was inquisitive and creative enough … I mean I got in trouble a lot at school and one big one was when after my experience at the University of Texas in summer working in a laboratory taking biology, I came back and I had known about evolution but I really hadn’t been exposed to this class. I realized how fundamental the ideas of Darwin about selection was fundamental to understanding biology, otherwise it is just a bunch of trees, flowers, species all these stuff, family kingdom and all this. That is a way of organizing it, but it is not a way that helps you understand. But the principals of selection can help you understand how things work and how things got to where they are going and better yet give you a worldview where you can begin to predict what is going to happen in the future. I refused to take the high school course because it didn’t have evolution in it. For religious reasons they didn’t teach it, and I said Well, I am not going to take the course and anyways it was quite a … playing chicken with the school because they said you have to take it because you need it to graduate and I said Well, I am not going to waste my time on memorizing kingdom phylum and all that stuff. And so they finally let me take biology from the University of Texas again by correspondence. I fought my way into getting proper training.;514;Environment
Who has influenced you?;"One would be Barrie Kitto. I worked with him as an undergraduate and graduate student getting my bachelor’s degree and my PhD. He taught me something about how to do science and sort of instilled in me that we do science because we have to and we should do things that benefit mankind to pay back for allowing us to have all this fun. And then I guess the other would be Lloyd Old again for giving me insights into how you really connect laboratory science with treating people and how you need to view every patient as a source of information. They shouldn’t be wasted by not doing everything you can to understand why a drug worked or why a drug didn’t work. And that patient … something that Pam Sharma has the same feelings about which is why I think we work so good together as we really are after the same thing eventually.
One of the things that we both believed in was that it is not enough just to do a clinical trial and look at clinical signals, you need to do science, dissect what is going on, tissue specimens of the cancer and blood and just look at what is happening in respect to immune cells and so you know what the mechanisms of what you are doing is because we know that only a fraction of patients actually respond to these things, at least when you give them one at a time, and so she worked very clever way called pre-surgical therapy. Pre-surgical trials where patients that have local disease are getting the drugs before they go to surgery. Then you get the whole organ to dissect and study and just start generating amazing data from it. We started collaborating on some of that work and I just started writing grants together, sort of grew out of that, so now we work together. We each got our own labs, but we are on a big operation called immunotherapy platform at MD Anderson where we got about almost 70 people that work for us in that group.
The whole goal of it is to study what is going on in patients, right now we are involved in about 115 trials of very diverse types of cancer. Very diverse immunological drugs and also working with pharmaceutical companies to bring us the newest drugs and work with us maybe from steps that haven’t been in humans yet, mice experiments to learn about it and I think it is unique in the world actually. We are generating what I think could be just very important data and have made some progress on enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic approaches for example in kidney cancer and pretty soon perhaps in prostate cancer where it hasn’t really worked up until now.";514;Mentors (Role models)
How did you react to being awarded the Nobel Prize?;Found out, got word of the award in a pretty strange way, for some reason the committee didn’t know how to get a hold of me so about 5.30 New York time the phone rang and I went Wow! but it was my son and he was watching the press conference broadcast and said ‘Dad, you won it, you won it!’ and that was how  I found out. It was actually about an hour and a half later before I got the official word. Some people realized what was going on and heard on television that they had trouble locating me so one of the public relations guys from where I work called them and said Hey, this is his cell phone number so … But that was a pleasure getting word from my son. Several of my friends and we had a meeting of cancer immunotherapy people, there were 2-3,000 people there, so really a lot of my very closest friends and people I have worked with for three or four decades were there and so the word begins to spread even at that early hour in the morning. And people somehow got their hands on bottles of champagne and so about 6.30 there’re about 15 people in our hotel room celebrating.;514;Impact of Nobel on you
How do you stay focused when people question your research?;There are a lot of points when people question your research. I have been through several episodes of that and the first is, before you say anything, you should be pretty sure you are right, you shouldn’t just go out there on a limb unless you want to. If you are wrong someone is going to prove you are wrong sooner or later, you should be the first one to do that. But I think that I have gotten into controversies before and if I am convinced enough that I am on the right track I pretty much ignore them. I’ll argue about it at meetings and stuff enough, but I just keep going and go to the next tap and just keep building up. I don’t get hung up and worrying. Try to do it so that when you get in a position with an argument you are confident enough that you are correct, you have done that experiment that tells you that there is no other explanation except the one you got. And if anybody challenges you they better have that one too.;514;Creativity
What is your greatest achievement in science?;better I guess my greatest achievement in science so far would be I think … There has been a number of them and figuring out how details work but I think it is the realization that what this molecule CTLA4 did. You know, I didn’t discover the molecule, it was discovered by others but its function was unknown for a long time and the first function that was proposed, we showed was incorrect. In simple terms it was thought to be another positive, you know like another gas pedal that we showed acknowledges the breaks. And we had to take that and say ‘Okay, now we can treat cancer’.;514;Motivation
Tell us about your passion for music.;"I am a musician, but I don’t know about highly accomplished. I have fun at it. Ever since I was kid I loved music. I tried to learn the guitar and piano and stuff like that but it was always beyond me, I just couldn’t. But at some point I picked up the harmonica which is very easy to play, very visceral instrument. I started playing for fun and then teamed up when I was doing my post-doc studies in San Diego. I teamed up with some Texas ex-pats who were there and played honky-tonk music at country-western bars around San Diego County, California. Then they went professional. I still played for fun and listened to records. And then at an immunology meeting, maybe 12 years ago, somebody spread the word to this conference that anybody who has a musical instrument bring them and we will get together and just play. It was an odd assortment of musics, a couple of guitars and keyboards, my harmonica and a trombone and lots of other things.
Anyway we just had lot of fun, but three of us, a keyboard player, a guitar player, just had a particular good time playing, and so after a few years we started to put together a band fairly serious and I called it Checkpoints after the immune checkpoint blockade. Everybody in the band is either a physician or a scientist working in that field. We have been playing ever since. Mostly plain sort of advanced amateurs, mostly at conferences, when people are there we do fund raises for cancer charities, and things like that. I have played with Billy Nelson several times, he has been one of my favourite musicians and just people you know for a long time for forty years or more and now I have had a chance to play with him several times. The most notable was sitting in with him briefly at the Austin City Limits Festival a few years ago when there was 70,000 people in the audience. It was pretty remarkable walking out in front of that many people.";514;Free time
Are there similarities between scientific research and playing music?;I think there are similarities between science and music. I mean, in both you try to build a team that works. Each person has its own contribution and their own part of the overall work to do. And hopefully all of them see the big picture as well but people take care of their own individual thing. When a good science team is working it is kind of like a good band where you can communicate just with a gesture of a head or a wink or something. The other person knows exactly what is going on. So there is the communication and every now and then my lab has been so well tuned it feels like a really good band, where it’s just going to go where it’s going to go without any conscious leadership. Everybody is just doing what they are supposed to do.;514;Creativity
What qualities are necessary to be a successful scientist?;"I think to be a successful scientist, of course you need to have a high degree of intelligence and discipline. After all, science involves making hypotheses and testing them, as I said, most of the time you are wrong and one thing that a lot of people miss too and you have to … especially young people, you have to really get the /- – -/ and to do that is kind of tedious because you finally get it all together then you got to do it all again at least twice more to make sure it is reproducible. You can’t skip that step, just because something happens once, you know you got to do it all. So you just have to be able to persevere but in the same time know when you are going down the wrong track.
It takes discipline but creativity, you have got to learn how to view your datas or crystal or something, you know when you look at every facet of it, get to know it from every direction. Look at what it tells you beyond the reason you did the experiment and figure it out. And so I think that’s pretty much it; it is the ability to really study the data and really learn what it is telling you. In order to avoid to keep doing experiments that are just going to give you results that are consistent with what you thought you think you should get, your job is really to turn that on its head and say I want to design an experiment that it can’t, that there is no other explanation, except one from this experiment and then decide to try to prove yourself wrong. And try hard, not just the easy ones you know that are consistent but I think the killer experiment. And I think it is the ability to recognize those and seek those rather than just the easy stuff.";514;Competencies
What do you hope the future holds for cancer research?;The word cancer became very shortly after it was conceived of was to really do basic science and understanding what causes cancer, what are the lesions, the genetic lesions and what are the circuits and everything. The ultimate goal was to design drugs to hit those things. The one thing that came out of that is that you can’t cure cancer doing that, because cancer cells are inherently unstable in their genomes. You can come up with a drug that treats one of those lesions but there will already be another one there that your drug doesn’t hit. But I think now where there are cases where the tumour will almost disappear, they never really or very very rarely with the drugs that came out of the official war on cancer, it will never kill all the cancer cells but then again you don’t need to kill all of them when you are treating with immunotherapy. You can use them like vaccines to kill the drugs that have the right lesion. They can be used to form a basis of a really more individualized approach to cancer therapy where you study what is going and treat them with the right drug, be it chemotherapy or the genomically targeted drugs and then come in with immunotherapy.;514;Future research
What’s next for you?;"What’s next is working with Pam Sharma. Right now in some cancers like metastatic melanoma combinations of checkpoint blockers we give long-lived, pretty durable responses. We don’t know how long because it hasn’t been enough time yet but it looks like about 60% which is pretty good because when we started on this if you were diagnosed with metastatic melanoma the immediate life expectancy was 11 months. And no drug had ever lengthened that, so now 60% of people are going to get four years. And we will see, it may be more. We need to get that to a 100%. In other cancers maybe 30% or something so we need to just, what I call ‘raise the tail’.
If you look at a survival curve in something like melanoma or other lethal cancers, we started at 100% and with time it drops down to some level. It used to go to zero at some point and you could just move the median over with treatments but now we know that the survival curve flattens out at some level at some point. But we need to get that as high by doing the right combinations as close to 100% as we can. And in other cancers, notably pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma really haven’t responded at all, and so we need to keep working very hard with those again not by just throwing random combinations of things but by doing the science, treat them with something, if it fails it fails, but look and see why it fails, what didn’t happen. It is easy if it works to figure out why it works, it is not so easy if it didn’t work. But by figuring out why it didn’t work can help you make it work, that something is being missed so that’s our passion. That is our goal right now. We know we can benefit a lot of patients. I think overall it is 20-25 % of all cancer patients, we would like to get that up as high as we can get it.";514;Future research
How did you receive the news that you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;The first message I received from another foundation was by a telephone call. It was around 5 p.m. of October 1st. Actually people told me that something happened maybe before 4 o’clock se we are completely free out of these things. We were concentrating with my colleague about our paper in the manuscript editing and suddenly my secretary came with some stiff face and knocked and opened the door and: “You have to take the phone!”, so I was not so sure what was going on, something bad or good. I took the phone and the person calling was Dr Perlmann so I made it to catch the point and then I had a very nice and pleasant conversation. But often I heard there is a fake call. And so of course he also mentioned I asked him to send an e-mail to just confirm. Once I received the e-mail, it was real and so we told everybody in the lab and of course my family and other kind of the good exciting celebration – I mean the nice picture. The picture we took then was posted on the website of the Nobel Foundation so it was a very exciting and pleasant and unforgettable incidence in my life.;515;Impact of Nobel on you
Why did you decide to become a scientist?;There are several reasons, first I had to decide whether go to medical school or the law school or several other choices. Of course I went to medical school strongly influenced by my father, I mean the family reason, and secondly I read the biography of Hideyo Noguchi who was the very interesting doctor, who went to the United States in his 20s and become professor in the Rockefeller Institute. He found the syphilis as a cause of the paralysis. He died in Ghana during his study on the yellow fever pathogen so that was very striking, and I went to medical school. And the other reason I had a friend, only a father and a son and he died of this stomach cancer, very acute and I was very sad and I thought can I do anything for this type of disease.;515;Motivation
Can you describe the main impact of your discovery?;Cancer immunotherapy has been, I mean the idea, has been around many decades before Jim Allison and myself demonstrated in the above system. The reason why many people failed one after another is they didn’t realise that the immune system is already suppressed by the tumor growth. If we push the accelerator of the immune system while the immune system is under the strong brake, there is no way they can drive the immune system forward. And only the people find the major immune negative regulator means a break, that was CTLA-4 and PD-1. Jim Allison first showed say CTLA-4 blockade can cure the cancer in animal model and soon after we found a PD-1, I mean we found the PD-1 before, but we demonstrated the PD-1 blockade can also cure the cancer. Unfortunately, the PD-1 one is less toxic, PD-1 blockade I mean, and has chronic and now it is used in a wide spectrum of tumor starting from melanoma, lung cancer, renal cancer, stomach cancer, many. That is slightly advantage of the PD-1 over CTLA-4. CTLA-4 has a very strong activity and sometimes too strong, also a bit side effect is strong.;515;Creativity
How does it feel to do work that saves lives?;I received many prizes of course before the Nobel Prize and this is probably the last prize I get. But I felt when I see the patient and saying they were saved by the therapy we developed, that is the most moving, and also the time I feel my life has some meaning. So that was the very very, you know, unforgettable and also very touching. And I feel awarded.;515;Meaning(Values) of Work
Can you tell us about some of the cancer patients you’ve met?;"I am not a clinician but I have been involved in some clinical trials and the one lady who had a big tumour, this is a ovarian tumour, and doctor of course thought hopeless but she recovered and that was almost five years ago and treatment lasted one year and she is still tumourfree and enjoying her life. One time I saw she was playing golf so it was really amazing. A similar story; I play golf myself and I have a friend who told me: “This is my last round in my life because I have lung cancer”. But about half a year or so later he came back and had just started the treatment we developed, and he was just completely cured. It was fantastic.";515;Environment
Do you have a message for those who are fighting cancer today?;Unfortunately our treatment is still not complete, only 20-30% are responders and we have a long way to go, but now this is just the beginning and many many scientists and the industry jumped in. I hope this therapy will be widely used and reach almost everybody in the world hopefully by the end of the century just like the infectious diseases almost completely eradicated during the last century. I hope this century will be remembered as the century of the cancer treatment. That’s my hope.;515;Meaning(Values) of Work
Do you think that diversity is important for fruitful research?;"Yes, I think so. Always, especially in the life science. We don’t exactly where is the best target. Nobody knows which mountain we should climb. We have to try many things, so for that purpose everybody has to think different ideas and have to discuss, so diversity is including everything; gender, nationality, different culture, maybe age. You have some brave young people, very brave, that’s good and aged people has more experience and that’s very important.";515;Diversity in Science
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?;To make yourself a good scientist I would say first, you have to have curiosity. If you don’t have any curiosity you better choose something else. To be good scientists we have to solve something new. Something new usually is not easy because it is difficult, that is why it remains unknown. You need enough courage to tackle this difficult problems and you need courage and that is a challenge. Challenge with courage. I call this three primary C’s. And then once you decide to tackle, you have to concentrate and continue and eventually you build up confidence. So this is another three C’s. That is what I tell my students.;515;Competencies
How have you maintained your curiosity?;"I never tried to keep my curiosity, it comes from inside. When I learn something new I always: Oh, this is quite interesting but why? Curiosity is just endless; it just comes from inside.";515;Creativity
Who has most inspired you?;There are several levels. As general science the first incident I was enchanted or charmed by the natural science is the very tiny tiny ring around the Saturn which I watched through the telescope at the elementary school. That was the first. I got very much interested, I wanted to be an astronomer and I read many books. But then later switched to medicine because I read the biography of Hideyo Noguchi. And the second very critical moment, maybe the time to come back to Japan, so it was another big choice in my life whether I stay in United Stated, keep going and many people advised to stay, but I decide to go back to Japan. That was -74, another type of turning point. Both cases I was fortunate that my decision was correct or correct because I made something, retrospective.;515;Mentors (Role models)
Was there a specific moment that sparked your interest in science?;For my science I have so many important mentors or advisors. The first mentor was Osamu Hayaishi, who discovered oxygen, gas oxygen directing cooperation into the organic compounds, gave my solid background in science and also international theory. Science has to be international, it is not a local thing. And the next person who opened my eye to the molecular immunology is Donald Brown of Carnegie Institution of Washington. Without him I never go into this particular field and then I went to Philip Leder’s laboratory where I actually started this antibody diversification. So those three are very important during my scientific career.;515;Motivation
How did you stay focused on your research for all these years?;I didn’t have any resistance, fortunately my parents very supportive, psychologically and financially they supported and my family, wife and children – I was kind of workaholic. I don’t spend much time with my family, I feel sorry for them, but they just allowed me to concentrate on my research, so I am very fortunate.;515;Creativity
You’re a keen golfer – do you do your best thinking on the golf course?;Playing golf I completely forget about science and I concentrate. But the reason why I like golf game it’s not the competition, it is kind of the fight against yourself. For example if you hit a bad shot you get angry but you get angry against yourself and always you have to think very carefully because every time you hit, the ball run into different conditions sometimes grass thick sometimes different weather and you always have to think. But it is a different type of challenge. I can completely forget about my science. It is also very enjoyable.;515;Life
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement?;For scientific career I think I made two major contributions. One is I found the molecular mechanism for the antibody diversity, namely antigen induced antibody diversity class switch recombination and somatic mutation and this PD-1 break discovery and its application to cancer immunotherapy. But these days, I am still working, I am very much pleased that my two lines are now coming very close. Because cancer immunotherapy depends lots on your gut microbiota. And gut microbiota regulation depends on IgA secretion and the molecule I discovered for antigen induced memory, AID, I found another important molecule. And the two molecules collaborate to maintain our gut microbiota and this is important for homeostasis and also anti-tumour immunity. So that is my scientific contribution, but for the personal life I have a family and two children, fortunately both are doing well. Our son is the medical doctor, physician, and daughter is the embryologist working in science field and what’s rest? I also served at the administration in the medical school and I also served as the scientific advisor to the Prime Minister almost ten years ago. And I don’t know whether I made something through this type of administrative work but at least I tried to improve scientific environment.;515;Creativity

What brought you to science?;"I came to science I think later than a lot of people certainly nowadays, because I know that I had not heard of science until I was thirteen/fourteen years old because I had a teacher who did not mention science. So I ended up going to boarding school, be thrown into science, not knowing the difference between physics and chemistry or what science was about. And so I came late, I came in the high school years, my late teen years, not my early years. It just happened more or less by chance which I can talk about if you like, but the chance my memories of those chances that made me interested.
At high school, the one thing that I do remember is going to a show when I was in high school, a agricultural show, a school outing and this is at a time when I was sort of struggling with my new exposure to physics and chemistry and I must have been about sixteen or seventeen years old. And the only thing I remember about the agricultural show, the absolutely only thing was coming away with a leaflet, an advertising leaflet from a company and I remember the company, I remember its name and it was about liver fluke disease, in sheep and cattle, caused by a warm parasite and it was advertising this treatment. And that didn’t change my life, I didn’t decide then and there that I wanted to work, but in retrospect I realize that that was the only thing that I remember seeing, the only leaflet I took home, I read it, I re-read it, I was totally fascinated by it. So in retrospect I think that I was predisposed or susceptible or right enough to want to be interested in natural science, so I think that was one thing. And then other things came at college, but I think that was sort of the earliest thing and then my college years were very formative.";520;Motivation
How did your work lead to the Nobel Prize?;My work was not some very discrete thing that could be associated with the prize. I had become tremendously interested in experimental chemotherapy directed towards parasitic diseases. My objective was finding new drugs and I had had some exposure with that finding the drug called thiabendazole before this new drug ivermectin. So I was deeply involved in this for many many years. And then with this new drug the thing that is difficult to relate and to get through to people is how collaborative it was, not just with professor Ōmura’s contribution to get things started with a new bacteria, but my role … there were a few things that were very specific, one working on heartworm disease of dogs which I did, I did the experimental work on that. And then my work in getting started … interest in human application of the drug. I was already interested in teaching and involved in human medicine as well as veterinary medicine with respect to parasites. I had the dog heartworm, I had initiating the work on human application for river blindness and of course as it turns out that was the biggest thing. I had administrative responsibilities as head of parasitology. So those were sort of three discrete things and as it turns out making things happen with respect to river blindness was the most conspicuous of those.;520;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Have you had a eureka moment?;Not in relation to this drug, and in fact not in relation to new drug discovery which is my primary field of interest. And I quite clear that I have not had a eureka moment and I think there is a good reason for it. And that is because I have a lot of experience and if you have experienced that field you know that when you discover a new substance that’s active in the disease you are working on it might be a drug that will be useful you know that the overwhelming probability is that it will not be useful because of so many things can go wrong and the chances of the drug surviving and overcoming all these hurtles is very small. And I think that is the reason, you get excited, but as always a subdued excitement and as it overcomes these various tests it has to go through you can ally yourself to get a little more excited, but that’s very different from a eureka moment and I think I had the eureka moments in stuff that I have done on the side.;520;Creativity
What motivated you to live a life in science?;I think the thing that really motivated me in the scientific field was a particular professor in my early college years as an undergraduate Trinity College Dublin. I had this professor who changed my life as a good professor will try to do and the good professors succeed in doing, because he was interested in parasites, especially parasitic warms. I found his work interesting and he was very kind and brought me into his sphere of activities and talked to me, he’d meet me in the car, he would talk to me about his work even though I was just a mere undergraduate of the lowliest status and he would have me come to the lab and watch him do experiments and things. He just changed my life by being such a wonderful guy and helping to crystalize what might have been some preexisting interest and certainly focusing my interest on parasites. I was really interested in natural science, but the focus on parasitic worms was entirely due to him and my making it a carrier, well first my coming to the United States was entirely due to him because of contact he had with some of the universities of Wisconsin, so he was the one who initiated the whole business of going from Ireland to the United States.;520;Motivation
What was his name and what do you think he would say if he saw you here today?;This professor was professor Desmond Smyth, J. D. Smyth, known as J.D. or Prof. Smith, but when I got to know him better after growing up, he was Desmond Smith and I remained in touch with him for the rest of his life and he visited me in the United States, visited my family. I visited him in London when he was based there and so we continued to be in touch for as long as he lived and it was a very good relationship. He inscribed one of his books that he sent to me and I haven’t thought of this recently, but it was an unusual inscription. It said ‘To Bill Campbell, my most appreciated student’, so he understood, I guess, I don’t know how that I appreciated his work. I don’t know if he ever understood how much I appreciated him, but he would be proud.;520;Mentors (Role models)
Do you have a good relationship with your students?;Yes, I was just recalling that with someone, cause just yesterday as we were traveling I got a text message from one of my former students who had just heard the news and she was so excited and was telling me about one of the other students and this has been one of the best parts of getting the Nobel Prize, has been hearing from students. One of my first students who’s gone on being a very successful medical practitioner, several of them have, but she just wrote the most exciting letter saying how she and my other students were all in touch with each other now to talk about this.;520;Advice for young scientists
When do you do your best thinking?;I do my best thinking when writing. When you do experiments you are following something that’s in your mind. And the best ones are things that you are desperately curious about, the experiments that you are doing, but you’re involved in the actual doing of the experiment, more than thinking. I have always been lucky that I love to write and that’s because of another teacher that I have not mentioned, but the most important of all in a sense. I learnt to like to write and so even writing very technical reports, I really am interested in writing it, either for clarity or what I hope might be style, but I am interested in writing as writing and I find that that is when other thoughts are most likely to come to me, because you realize suddenly you are saying this and you are thinking have you really made it clear and if not is it because you are not clear yourself? And if so, you start thinking about why you are not clear on it. If it is something that you are proposing in the future, if you are going to write about it you have to ask yourself, not just in some general term. You have to actually think about that. So I think writing is conducive to thinking.;520;Environment
What did you donate to the Nobel Museum?;"One of the interesting things to me was the question of donating items to the museum and my first response in fact, to the museum, was that I can’t really think of anything, but I will get back to you. And for a long time I couldn’t think of anything, because from examples in the past, I kept thinking of what I might have is an objective from the lab or something. I couldn’t think of anything that made sense, but then I suddenly realized that in fact a large part of my work has been related to non-work, to interest in writing and painting, so those were interests of mine. So what I decided that I would donate to the museum would be two books that I have published myself. I published myself on the assumption that they are too narrow in the focus for anybody else to want to publish them. Because the book of paintings are all paintings of parasites, but they are not illustrations, they are not scientific illustrations, they are expressionistic variations on parasites, but they are certainly identifiable, not only as parasites, but as specific parasites and parasitologist can identify them immediately as to what exactly they are. And I have great motivation to pursue this because they get sold at auctions to raise money for scholarships for parasitology students to enable to attend parasitology meetings. So it is a rather narrow focus, a clientele so to speak, but is a very exuberant one and very active and so I have motivation to paint.
But then also my writing is obviously much more a personal matter because it is a very personal thing to write poetry, but I find it … I decided partly because of other professors, one in particular, who asked if she could have manuscript copies of my poems and she would type them up and then she could use them in her classrooms, because a lot of them are about parasites. Then I realized that maybe I should do this in a book form and nowadays it is easy to do it even if you don’t think it could be something that the general publisher could be interested in and you can actually make a book. So I have made books and I have taken some of those to the auction too, but the book of poems is definitely not all about parasites. There are poems about history, a lot of poems about history, history of biomedical science, some not related to science at all, some quite personal, some written for children so … and that was a period of my life I wanted to write a poem about. I still want to paint, I don’t at present have … I have an amuse at my side, I don’t have poems that want to get out, so to speak and I don’t know if that will come back, but certainly for a period of my life there were poems that I just needed to write and not all scientific.";520;Donation to Nobel
What challenges remain in your field of research?;"In my field of research there is a number of specific technical things, but I think the overall importance in the future and the thing that is not talked about is the need to have more natural means of disease control, and I think of disease in terms of parasitic disease. But it is not necessarily confined parasitic disease, but I think although I have devoted a good part of my life to developing agents, chemical agents, natural projects leading to chemical agents to kill worms, I have a feeling in the long run that’s not the best way to go. I think chemical intervention as we have discovered over the years is likely to have not just unforeseen consequences, but natural consequences that lead to unnatural outcomes that can be bad.
So I think that the minimal interference with the natural world is to be desired and that if we can understand for example the immune system so well that we can actually stimulate it or simulate it even better with some natural way, we might have a more balanced approach to control disease and less looking for absolutes. And then that’s with psychological differences, psychological challenges with that because everybody would like a zero disease in 100% of people. But I think we need to try and get away from what we have been doing and try and focus on understanding disease and host parasite relationships, and by parasite then I mean all kind of infectious agents so deeply that we can actually use some control without trying to exterminate things widely and broadly.";520;Future research
What advice would you give yourself at 20 years old?;I would advise myself to find work that is hard and gratifying. I think I don’t believe in such a thing as a cushy job, because the cushy job is not really work and I think everybody needs to have hard work, and if you have hard work and you are miserable at it, then your life is miserable and your family is miserable and that’s to be avoided. Some people unfortunately get trapped into being committed to work that they don’t really enjoy and that’s unfortunate. So I think what I would say to myself is find something you would like to do and then don’t shy away from really working at it. I think there are the two things, hard work and getting satisfaction, not necessarily live a life of pleasure, but a life of hard work and pleasurable challenge.;520;Advice for young scientists
How are art and science related?;"I think for me the thing about science and art is I like to have them overlap, I think they are different things and that we shouldn’t forget that they are different things, they are definitely different. I look for things not as an avocation or a hobby to keep them separate. I don’t look to writing as an escape from parasitology, I don’t look for one … well I don’t look at either one as a hobby. To me the great satisfaction has been being able to make them overlap so that I write quite a lot about parasites, and frequently I am writing a poem trying to look at things from the parasite’s point of view, so several of my poems are actually written from the parasite’s point of view, and there is at least one actually written as though spoken by the parasite.
I think I am so interested in parasites that I tend to think about them even when I come to write poems, because sometimes I’ve tried to say what I think they would want to say. Sometimes it’s about history, because there again I think feel that I am interested in history, so I write poems about those things in history that interests me in terms of medical history, so there is definitely an overlap. I have written some poems that are not about science, but those are few compared to the numbers that do touch either on parasites or other … or science history.";520;Creativity
Can you tell us about one of your poems?;Well, in fact one of them is in the context of river blindness which is sort of the most talked about aspect of this all new drug ivermectin which is used to prevent river blindness in the tropics. The cause of the disease is a parasite called Onchocerca and so one of the parasites, Onchocerca, speaks, and it’s in the words of the parasite and it begins with some rather extreme language and not by the day standard, but it says ‘I don’t need your good damn eye’ and that’s because the parasite  damages the eye. But the parasite doesn’t need to, the parasite’s got lots of other places to go, the parasite gets through accidently, so here is this poor parasite associated with making people blind, but in fact most of the parasite activity is elsewhere in the body, in the skin. Some of them in the course of their migration, then of course they have to migrate, some of them end up in the eye and as they end up in the eye they cause eye problems and eventually they cause blindness. So I would like to think of the parasite, saying ‘I am not trying to do this to you, I am doing my own thing and this happens’. That’s an extreme case speaking from the parasites point of view.;520;Creativity
What is your favorite poem?;One of the poems of William Butler Yeats that is considered one of his minor ones and I think the critics even convinced Yeats that this was not worthy of him, that this was an early poem when he was not really at his best, but it’s ‘The Lake Isle of Innisfree’. It happens that Yeats was born and grew up maybe 15 miles or so from where I grew up in Ireland, I don’t know if that has anything to do with it, but this particularly poem he wrote when he was in London. He certainly wrote it as, not as someone exiled as punishment or some dishonoured but neverless somebody away from his homeland. I can really identify with that, you are not there because you are forced out, you are there because you have chosen and yet you are longing for something so it’s that ambivalence I think is more subtle than people realize. At least I can, to me that is certainly my favorite poem.;520;Life
What role has teaching played in your life?;"Teaching has been one of my great joys and yet I spent most of my professional life not in a teaching situation. Then maybe it’s because I spent most of it not in teaching situation that I loved it when I did get to a teaching situation. Because when I retired from industry, I retired from an American company in the pharmacy industry and went to the academia, to Drew University in New Jersey, I went there actually not to teach. I went there to mentor undergraduate students, but I chose to teach as also one other person, colleague did in this institute, The Research Institute for Scientists Emeriti at Drew University, which is a wonderful wonderful institute and the emphasis is on mentoring. A couple of us chose to teach and I taught in an undergraduate biology department and I taught undergraduate school medical humanities program and I just loved that.
All along I used to teach seminars and I taught medical helminthology, I taught about parasitic worms at New York medical college for 25 years overlapping with those other jobs. So I discovered that I loved teaching and I hope to go on doing that, but now it will be largely at conferences and meetings, but especially if there are conferences were a lot of students tend to come and just this past summer I was at one such conference where it was not … it was in the place where there were not expensive hotels and were the tradition of students coming because it was accessible and I greatly enjoyed that and I hope to continue to do that.";520;Mentors (Role models)
How has your life changed since being awarded the Nobel Prize?;The way my life has changed mostly since I got that call was in sheer busyness. I have always been busy cause I chose to be busy, but now I don’t get to choose what sort of business I am engaged in. Now I am overwhelmed with messages, the good part of it is that many messages are from old friends, the bad part is that there are so many messages of all kinds and that I am now retired, I don’t have a secretary, I have my wonderful wife who helps, but still we are very much in retirement mode and so this is a major change in our lives to be called upon to answer so many questions and to respond to so many invitations to conferences all over the world. Some of them several years in advance, and at my age I think it is a bit presumptuous to make plans many years in advance. So I am trying to be careful about that and I am trying to also continue to do the things that I have been doing. I still like to go out in season and kayak an early morning and I still play ping-pong three times a week and I am determined not to give up certain things like that, but it certainly has been a challenge just to keep up with the calls on my time.;520;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Could you explain your awarded work in easy-to-understand terms.;One of the fundamental things that humans and animals do, is find their way around the world. So, to do that they need to know where they are, and they need to know where other things are, and they need to know the relationship between these places. And the way the brain does that, is it represents the place where you are now, and it represents distances and directions. Over the years what we have been able to establish is, which parts of the brain do this, particularly a part of the brain called the hippocampus and its related areas, especially one of them, the entorhinal cortex and what types of cells that are there which represent these different kinds of spatial information. And we know that there are cells representing places so when you are in a familiar environment, different cells represent different locations in the environment. We know there are cells which represent directions so that when you are looking in a particular direction or moving in a particular direction, there are cells which tell the rest of the brain that. And then we also know there are cells which appear to tell the distances that are moved in particular directions. And if you put all these together what that provides you with is something we call a cognitive map which is a framework for identifying where you are, where other things are in the environment and how to get from one place to another.;523;Research
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;When I first discovered the place cells, which is what I received the prize for, I very quickly realised that if my interpretation of these cells was correct and of course, one never knows, one has to do further experiments, control experiments and I’ve had several instances in my career where I thought I had really made a wonderful discovery which turned out just to be something much much more simple when you looked into it carefully. But when I saw the place cells and realised that they might be representing the abstract concept of a place and not a much more concrete things such as where a particular object is or visual stimulus. Then I realised this probably would have very important implications because there were much work in the past, much interest in space and how it is represented by psychologists and philosophers, mathematicians. So, I realised if we had actually found the system in the brain which was the basis for representing space in the brain that this would potentially be very, very important.;523;Creativity
What brought you to science?;To be honest, I had a very variegated early carrier. I worked in various jobs, and at one point I was an engineer working making airplanes. And while I was studying engineering, I became interested in philosophy. And particularly in those areas of philosophy which were dealing with the mind-body problem, how things were represented in the mind and things like that. And I began to think that it was just possible that if we understood more about the brain, we will be able to understand some of the problems which people have been dealing with for centuries and millennia. So, I set out on a course where I decided it would be great to study the brain. In those days there wasn’t anything called neuroscience, there were several people studying the brain, but it wasn’t a very developed subject. So, I went back to university full time and ended up doing psychology because that was one of the few areas where you could study the brain. So, I came to the field of studying the brain, neuroscience, really through my interest in philosophy and trying to answer some of the fundamental questions. I think I have been very lucky that it turns out that I have made a contribution towards one of those questions and I am very fortunate to have done so.;523;Motivation
What were you doing when you heard you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;I actually spend, quite often I spend, mornings at home and I try to do a lot of the paperwork and quite a bit of my writing at home, so I was at home. So, the call was taken at my workplace by one of my colleagues, and she called me, and she said: “Are you standing up or sitting down?” because I think she knew what the implications were and then she said: “ I have a call here from a gentleman, he’s Swedish, he is from Stockholm and he says it is rather urgent that you call him back in the next 45 minutes”. So, I then took a big deep breath, and, actually I have to admit that I looked up whether the phone number was a Stockholm number and then called him back and of course and he told me and it was quite a thrill.;523;Impact of Nobel on you
Could you please explain your Nobel Prize awarded work for 13-14 year olds?;"Edvard Moser: We have discovered parts of an internal map that we have in our brain, a map that tells the rest of the brain where we are in the room or in the world.
May-Britt Moser: It is like a GPS-system almost.
Edvard Moser: There are different types of cells. O’Keefe, who is the third prize winner, he found a type of cell that is called place cell, which is active only when animals or humans are in one certain place. We found another type of cell that fires active in many places and those places where the cell is active tend to form strictly hexagonal patterns so the many locations in the room where the cell is active form a grid or like a coordinate system that tells the brain where we are.
May-Britt Moser: The animal is walking, and it can be an animal, it can be a human being, then you can record with tiny sensors in the brain and you record the electrical pulses that are released from the cells and you magnify them 10 000 times and then we can listen to one by one cell. And then if we now listen to one place cell and this is the area where the animal is walking around – this is the rat and then it is silent, silent, silent and then suddenly you start to hear: “Po, po, po, po, popo, popo, popopo” and then the rat is moving out again. And whenever the animal is coming back to this place, it is the same thing happening: “Po, po, po, po, popo, popo, popopo” and it doesn’t matter how the animal is coming in, from which directions. And the interesting part is that these place cells, they are located in different areas in the environment. So, one place would be active here, and another here and so on, but then the grid cell that we found doesn’t have one single active field, but it has several ones and they are separate like Edvard said, like each field look like a checkerboard, how do you say? The chess …
Edvard Moser: Like hole in a Chinese checkerboard.
May-Britt Moser: Yes, like a Chinese checkerboard, thank you. So then where the marble should go, that is where the activity field is. And we know that this Chinese checkerboard, they have all these small triangles in between all marbles and that is exactly the firing patterns of the grid cells. Then the grid cells come in different sizes, big fields, big distance between the fields, small and so on. This is the information that goes into the hippocampus, which is the place cell, where John O’Keefe found the place cell. And the interesting part is that, the hippocampus with the place cells, if you lose your cells in this structure, you can’t remember what you had for breakfast, if you had breakfast at all. And if you lose the same cells you can’t find your way in the environment and the input to these cells, that is the grid cells. So, the grid cells are tightly involved in both space navigation and memory.";524;Research
What brought you to science?;"Edvard Moser: For me, I was interested in science already when I was a child. I didn’t really know what is was, but I read a lot about scientists and their work and I thought becoming a scientist was like digging dinosaurs, that is what I thought, but I thought that was exciting. And then I read about meteorology and about volcanos and about physics, everything that I could come over, so I nearly knew that I wanted to do this but didn’t really know much what is was like. And then many years later, when I came to university, then … Because I knew wanted to go to university, and then together with May-Britt I then began studies of psychology and then the part of psychology that excited both of us by far the most, was the brain and trying to explain behaviour by the brain and that is an experimental science. And I think I never really had anything else on my mind at least, except perhaps for very short breaks, so I wanted to be a scientist from the beginning.
May-Britt Moser: You wanted to study volcanoes.
Edvard Moser: Yes, I mean the field was open. For a long time I wanted to become a physicist and work on elementary particles, but now I am so glad that I ended up in the brain.
May-Britt Moser: I didn’t read that much as Edvard did but I was extremely curious. And I was curious on humans and animals and I really wanted to understand why they do this and why they don’t do that. And when I became older I knew that I have to go to the university in order to do this, but I didn’t, as Edvard said, I didn’t know how, so when I went to the university finally then I started to study mathematics and physics because those were the topics I loved in the high school, but I didn’t know what kind of job I could get. And then luckily I met Edvard, even though we had been at the same high school, we didn’t know each other that well and then we decided, hm, should we do this together, and then we just made a new path step by step without knowing other things standing star in front of us. We want to understand why the brain or how the brain is working to give behaviour. That is what we’re still doing, and it is fantastic.";524;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;"Edvard Moser: I’m not sure there is a single role model.
May-Britt Moser: Me!
Edvard Moser: No, I think it is part of becoming a scientist that you actually have to trust your own judgement as well and go for the really long term goals that no one else has put up, but there are many scientists who I admire but I think it would be kind of wrong to mention one by name because then I always forget the second one.
May-Britt Moser: As you say it is extremely important the support that we have got from other scientists and that they have believed in us and given advice when we needed advice. For example, when we started with our labs just half-year after our PhD:s. That was a crazy decision but still people supported us and said, you can do it if you focus on this and that if you collaborate instead of splitting and trying to build two labs and so on.
Edvard Moser: But since the context is Nobel Prizes, you can always mention a few names at least, so Eric Kandel, his work we got exposed to very early and already in the 1980’s was work that we read about and thought was super exciting and then we met him and he has sort of followed us all the way. Another one is Torsten Wiesel, who is also related to Sweden. His work in the 60s especially, was extremely important.
May-Britt Moser: Hubel and Wiesel, it was just like the bible, and the same with Eric Kandel’s book.
Edvard Moser: Defined our field. So those two are at least persons that have meant a lot both for our field and for us personally.
May-Britt Moser: And also for my PhD, then I studied structural changes after different experiences, like living in a enriched environment and then it was so fantastic for me to read about the Aplysia work of Eric Kandel because he had shown the same thing in the Aplysia when this tiny sea slug is learning. And then I could believe also in my own data because I have read his work. On a lot of different occasions, these people have been important, and also when we were master students.";524;Mentors (Role models)
At what point did you realise your work was a breakthrough?;"Edvard Moser: I think pretty early actually, when we saw that the firing pattern of this cells forms a strictly hexagonal structure, so very, very regular, almost like a coordinate system then …
May-Britt Moser: That was crazy.
Edvard Moser: … and it was so different from what anyone had expected that we knew that this would be kind of revolutionary, so we worked on really, being sure that there was no mistake in the data. We did lots of control experiments and we sent it to Nature and it went right in, so that kind of confirmed our suspicion that it was important. Yet it was of course, difficult to imagine that only nine years later it will be a Nobel Prize. That is perhaps beyond, but still we knew that it was very important from the beginning.
May-Britt Moser: The exciting part of these cells is, like Edvard said, that we tried to do all these controls to find out – is there a specific order, does the rat see something specific that make this grid pattern – and there is none. That means that this pattern is generated by the brain itself and then it’s like going into the brain and detecting the mystery of the brain by studying these cells. And if you start to understand even more how they are generated we understand so much about how the brain is working.";524;Creativity
What were you doing when you heard you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Edvard Moser: In my case, I was actually out flying, so the rest of the world knew about it and I didn’t know anything. So I only got the news when I landed and that was also a bit peculiar because I came out of the airplane and then I was met like a VIP with flowers and name sign at the gate, not after the baggage as usual. I sensed something was strange, but it wasn’t on my mind that this was the day when the Nobel Prize was announced. I would have known it, but I didn’t think about it. And then I asked: “Why all this special attention?” and the lady who picked me up she didn’t know, she knew that it was a prize, but she didn’t know which prize. So she mixed it up with something else and was still not clear and what made it clear to me was when I checked my phone because on that flight to Munich, two hours, then there had been hundreds of calls and then there was a text message from Göran Hansson, the secretary of the Nobel Committee and then I, sort of, finally sensed it.;524;Impact of Nobel on you
And where were you, May-Britt?;May-Britt Moser: When I heard about the prize, then I was in a lab meeting at a lab and it was such an exciting meeting and it went over time and I was expecting to have another meeting with other people. I got this phone call and I saw it and I said: “No, I don’t recognize this number, I don’t want to speak to this person, I am so busy”. And then I thought, hm, maybe I should take this phone and pick it up and I did, and I heard that it was Göran Hansson and then I was just, hm, why are you calling me? And then I thought maybe this is something serious, I went to my office and then I realized that it was about the Nobel Prize. Then I thought maybe he wants to have some comments about another Nobel Prize winner, just let me sit down and relax and then he said “No, it is you. You and O’Keefe and Edvard who got the Nobel Prize” and I said: “No, I don’t believe you, please can you send me an e-mail so that I can read it because I don’t believe my ears”. And then I got the e-mail and still I didn’t believe it. So it went on and off, I believed it and then I didn’t believe it and then I went to the dean and showed the letter on my phone to the dean and said: “Do you read the same thing as I do?”. He was just: What do you have here?” and then he: “You won the Nobel Prize?”, and it was crazy. So that was an experience, but then I realized that I was so grateful. Especially also about getting this focus on the work that Edvard and I had done and the whole team and also the support that we have got from Norway, from NTNU, from the local university, from politicians abroad, Kavli Institute and it was just  “oh wow”, finally we can say thank you to them, that they believed in us.;524;Life
Could you please explain your Nobel Prize awarded work for 13-14 year olds?;"Edvard Moser: We have discovered parts of an internal map that we have in our brain, a map that tells the rest of the brain where we are in the room or in the world.
May-Britt Moser: It is like a GPS-system almost.
Edvard Moser: There are different types of cells. O’Keefe, who is the third prize winner, he found a type of cell that is called place cell, which is active only when animals or humans are in one certain place. We found another type of cell that fires active in many places and those places where the cell is active tend to form strictly hexagonal patterns so the many locations in the room where the cell is active form a grid or like a coordinate system that tells the brain where we are.
May-Britt Moser: The animal is walking, and it can be an animal, it can be a human being, then you can record with tiny sensors in the brain and you record the electrical pulses that are released from the cells and you magnify them 10 000 times and then we can listen to one by one cell. And then if we now listen to one place cell and this is the area where the animal is walking around – this is the rat and then it is silent, silent, silent and then suddenly you start to hear: “Po, po, po, po, popo, popo, popopo” and then the rat is moving out again. And whenever the animal is coming back to this place, it is the same thing happening: “Po, po, po, po, popo, popo, popopo” and it doesn’t matter how the animal is coming in, from which directions. And the interesting part is that these place cells, they are located in different areas in the environment. So, one place would be active here, and another here and so on, but then the grid cell that we found doesn’t have one single active field, but it has several ones and they are separate like Edvard said, like each field look like a checkerboard, how do you say? The chess …
Edvard Moser: Like hole in a Chinese checkerboard.
May-Britt Moser: Yes, like a Chinese checkerboard, thank you. So then where the marble should go, that is where the activity field is. And we know that this Chinese checkerboard, they have all these small triangles in between all marbles and that is exactly the firing patterns of the grid cells. Then the grid cells come in different sizes, big fields, big distance between the fields, small and so on. This is the information that goes into the hippocampus, which is the place cell, where John O’Keefe found the place cell. And the interesting part is that, the hippocampus with the place cells, if you lose your cells in this structure, you can’t remember what you had for breakfast, if you had breakfast at all. And if you lose the same cells you can’t find your way in the environment and the input to these cells, that is the grid cells. So, the grid cells are tightly involved in both space navigation and memory.";525;Research
What brought you to science?;"Edvard Moser: For me, I was interested in science already when I was a child. I didn’t really know what is was, but I read a lot about scientists and their work and I thought becoming a scientist was like digging dinosaurs, that is what I thought, but I thought that was exciting. And then I read about meteorology and about volcanos and about physics, everything that I could come over, so I nearly knew that I wanted to do this but didn’t really know much what is was like. And then many years later, when I came to university, then … Because I knew wanted to go to university, and then together with May-Britt I then began studies of psychology and then the part of psychology that excited both of us by far the most, was the brain and trying to explain behaviour by the brain and that is an experimental science. And I think I never really had anything else on my mind at least, except perhaps for very short breaks, so I wanted to be a scientist from the beginning.
May-Britt Moser: You wanted to study volcanoes.
Edvard Moser: Yes, I mean the field was open. For a long time I wanted to become a physicist and work on elementary particles, but now I am so glad that I ended up in the brain.
May-Britt Moser: I didn’t read that much as Edvard did but I was extremely curious. And I was curious on humans and animals and I really wanted to understand why they do this and why they don’t do that. And when I became older I knew that I have to go to the university in order to do this, but I didn’t, as Edvard said, I didn’t know how, so when I went to the university finally then I started to study mathematics and physics because those were the topics I loved in the high school, but I didn’t know what kind of job I could get. And then luckily I met Edvard, even though we had been at the same high school, we didn’t know each other that well and then we decided, hm, should we do this together, and then we just made a new path step by step without knowing other things standing star in front of us. We want to understand why the brain or how the brain is working to give behaviour. That is what we’re still doing, and it is fantastic.";525;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;"Edvard Moser: I’m not sure there is a single role model.
May-Britt Moser: Me!

Could you explain your Nobel Prize awarded work to young students?;To the young teenagers and other students when you study science and you start thinking about the human body. One of first things that you are taught is that the body has a lot of parts, we have our brain, we have our muscles and we have the various parts inside the body, the so-called organs. They teach you a lot about these different parts of the body, but one of the most important things is how the different parts of the body talk to each other. How does the brain talk to the muscle to tell you to move an arm, for example? We call that synaptic or neuronal communication. How does your stomach talk to your pancreas to cause hormones like insulin to control the sugar that you are eating and make sure that the right amount of sugar goes throughout your body and then to your brain so your brain can be thinking in a way because I hope you are right now if you are listening to this. It is those very basic questions of cell to cell communication in the body that professors Südhof, Schekman and I have helped to understand.;526;Research
What brought you to science?;You know there are some scientists who … they sort of get into science accidently, they met somebody, or they saw somebody or whatever their story is. In my case I can’t ever remember not wanting to be a scientist. I think I briefly flirted with the idea of driving a locomotive train when I was probably two or three. I was very fortunate to come from a family that was very focused on education. My father was a doctor in a small town, but education and especially science and medicine were an important part of the sort of family culture and so I also grew up in the United States of America. I was born in 1950, the significance in that was that after world war two America was really at that time seen it was becoming and it already was a very powerful country. It was taking on global responsibilities including scientific research, but also in a major competition with the Soviet Union as everybody knows, the so-called Cold War. When the Soviets developed the nuclear bomb and when they also were the first to put satellites into space, quite frankly it scared the wham out of certainly Americans, but certainly a lot of the world. It caused an energy … the whole enterprise of scientific research especially the physical sciences, but also biomedical sciences got energized. So that’s the environment that I grew up in and in that environment scientists and medical doctors doing research and so on, we are really prized by society. I am not entirely sure that’s so true today, but it was certainly true then and we were seen as assets, very little in the liability call, so you know as a young boy your hero might have been a baseball player, but it might also have been a physicist like Oppenheim or Einstein.;526;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;"Sometimes I get asked the question, who is my role model? I guess the answer to that is it probably depends at what age. When I was really young and probably did have role models that affected me, I didn’t know the concept of a role model. I actually think that the role models that we have that really help determine our character. I mean of course there are our parents and our friends, made a family, but I don’t think we really think about that at the time when it has the most effect. Later on in life, as you are an adult, you have your teachers and I have had mine, but I guess I feel like I have had many, not just one and I have been very fortunate for that reason. I think people who are successful in life have the wonderful accident of having had, whether intentional or not, sometimes you find the person who you admire, that’s a skill, but the ability to have that skill to seek out a role model is something that probably is acquired through role models that we don’t seek out.
As a young scientist there was a great biochemist who was very influential to me and also, I have to say when you interview Randy Schekman I am sure you hear the same name. His name was Arthur Kornberg. Arthur Kornberg was one of the great biochemists of the twentieth century, possibly the greatest biochemist of the second half of the twentieth century. He was my hero as I was learning biochemistry and I actually left medical school without finishing my medical doctor’s degree in order to take the opportunity to work in a laboratory next to professor Kornberg. My first job as an independent scientist was as a young professor at Stanford University and Arthur was the chief of the department really and actually was a great inspiration to me. The work that was recognized in this Nobel Prize, my contribution to it, began during that period and I don’t think that I would have been as successful in doing what I did if it were not for the kind of scientific environment that he fostered and the type of science that he represented which we called enzymology. He was without a doubt the master of enzymology of his era and for me to have the opportunity to take that discipline to a new level under the watchful eyes of the master was quite an extraordinary experience. He won the Nobel Prize by the way many years ago and I believe 1959.";526;Mentors (Role models)
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;It’s always difficult to know at any one time as a basic scientist whether what you are doing at that time is going to have some monumental significance. I am not sure my work has monumental significance, but it certainly has been recognized as having some significance. The thing about basic science is that we any one day, any one experiment, you never really know, you try your best every single day. I tell my students every day that you work in the lab is a day that you will never have again, so think very carefully to do the most important thing that you can do every day. But the nature of science is such that if you are doing real research on the frontier where nobody has ever been, it doesn’t always work. The hardest thing about being a scientist is you have to be prepared to fail most of the time. A Nobel Laureate might be a scientist who fails only 99% of the time, maybe everybody else is a little bit less luckier or whatever fails 99.9% of the time. By definition what you are doing at any one time, it’s a little hard to know if it’s the most important. On the other hand, when it does happen, and it’s happened to me actually twice. I have had very special moments and I kind of understood and everybody around me kind of understood that it was a special moment. We celebrated some of the basic discoveries at the time they were made with my co-workers. With scientists, it’s also very important for students especially, to understand that science these days is not a solo enterprise, it’s the work of a team. It’s students, professors and we all contribute, not everyone gets recognized with the Nobel Prize, but there are a lot of people who contribute.;526;Creativity
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Nobel Prize?;The experience of getting a telephone call from Stockholm at 04.30 in the morning is absolutely singular. I was of course sleeping when it came, but not for long and woke up rather abruptly. I went to sleep actually quite late the night before and perhaps had a little too much to drink and but my wife Joy of course woke up at the same time and said: “This might be it!” and of course I was thinking the same thing and sure enough it was and there was a voice not entirely unfamiliar to me, professor Hansson, I had met on a couple of meetings, didn’t know him well, but it was wonderful news.;526;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Is basic research important?;It’s a terrific honor to be recognized by a Nobel Prize. This year we have three Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine and the emphasis, as the Nobel Committee mentioned in their announcement, is on the physiology, but also the medicine. This is a basic science prize and it recognizes fundamental research whose medical implications are not immediate, they will happen, some of them are already happening, but what it really does is it celebrates the importance of understanding the life process in and of itself. That focus on the importance of fundamental research, in this case in the life sciences, is something that the Nobel Prize contributes importantly to, because oftentimes this type of work goes less noticed than the next momentary medical advance or clinical trial and funding for basic science research around the world is in serious jeopardy, particularly in the United States, but not only in the United States and certain parts of Europe, even here in Sweden. Although there is good funding for basic research, it could be better and so it’s really important that the type of work that we represent and what we represent is just a tip of an iceberg and there are many of tips and it’s great when these tips of the iceberg are recognized from time to time.;526;Creativity
Could you explain your Nobel Prize awarded work to young students?;"My work involves studying how protein molecules, which are the machines that operate life, how some of them are shipped outside of a cell, Almost all the cells in our body produce most of the proteins that act inside the cell and do the chemistry of life, but about 10% of the proteins on average are special proteins that have to be incapsulated and then sent by export out of the cell and these are proteins that everyone knows about, insulin, growth factors , hormones, all of the proteins in your blood are actually manufactured inside of a cell and then have a special machinery for their export. This pathway was first understood by using the electron microscope to peer inside of a human pancreatic cell and the Nobel Prize in 1974 was given to a pioneer by name of George Palade who understood how the machinery inside of the cells conveyed molecules outside of the cell. What he didn’t understand, because of the technics available at the time, was how these machines operate.
When I started my career at Berkeley I chose to study baker’s yeast which is not a traditional system to evaluate protein secretion but they still, that’s how they grow and divide, they actually secret and assemble their membrane using this process and secretion. My first graduate student, one of my first students, Peter Novick and I developed a genetic approach that allowed us to isolate mutations that cripple this process and when we did so we were able to see that these cells use a process that’s essentially the same as human cells and as a result the biotechnology industry was able using yeast as a vehicle for the production of useful human proteins in fact. One third of the world supply of human insulin is made secretion and yeast so we what we did which was just very basic turned out to have quite practical application.";527;Research
What brought you to science?;My dad was an engineer so there was some interest in science. My own interest developed when I was very young. I had a toy microscope and I was fascinated with life forms that I could see in pond scum. I saved up my money and I brought a professional microscope when I was a young teenager and I have actually just today donated that microscope to the Nobel Museum. It’s really very important in my early development of an interest in microbiology and that just sort of naturally evolved and when I got to university I continued to study viruses and microorganisms and that interest has continued to this day.;527;Motivation
How did you learn that you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;At 01.20 in the morning on October 7 I was fast asleep. The phone rang, I am not sure I heard it, my wife yelled out: “This is it!” so I stumbled out of bed, still half asleep, got to the phone and I think I was trembling at this point, but I am pretty sure I knew what it was, and I was greeted by a nice Swedish accent on the other side, Göran Hansson. At that point I think I said: “Oh my god” and then he assured me after congratulating me that it was not a hoax and then the fog lifted so I sort of decided how I had to proceed for the next hour or so before the press conference. The first person I called was my father, 86 years old, who has been hopeful for years about this, so he was ecstatic. I called my kids, I called my best friend and then I called the press officer at Berkeley because I was warned years ago that I had do this and as result there were two press officers in my home at 02.30 in the morning lining up the TV-camera crews and since then my life has not been the same.;527;Impact of Nobel on you
Who is your role model, and why?;I had many people who were inspiring models, two of them stand out though, one was my graduate adviser Arthur Kornberg who had the very highest standards in science and scholarship of anyone that I had ever met, really rigorous, very demanding, tough guy, but I learnt I great deal from him how to do science. And at a very different level, another great scientist, Daniel Koshland was the chairman of the biochemistry department at Berkeley when I was hired as a beginning faculty member. He had in additional to great scientific qualities a concern for science as a leader of scientists. He was chairman of the department, he was very collegial, concerned about promoting the university and promoting public higher education and I have taken his example in doing the many other things that I do. I value him as highly as I value what I learnt from Kornberg. He was the editor of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, then he became the editor of Science magazine and I followed in his footsteps. I was for five years the editor in chief of the Proceedings of the National Academy, but then more recently I have taken on a new role as an editor of a new online journal called e-Life which is journal sponsored by Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Wellcome Trust and Max Planck Society. We feel very strongly that there’s a need for another journal at the very high end where the decisions are made by active scientists and where the limitations impose by the print model do not apply so we accept papers and publish full length papers and we don’t have artificial restrictions based on some feather fashion so this is a journal that I am promoting. Actually, from here in Stockholm I will be speaking to journalists about his.;527;Mentors (Role models)
Have you ever had an eureka moment?;There is a eureka moment that happened early on in the work that Novick and I were doing. He isolated the first mutant and he could see, using simple assays, that the enzymes that normally are secreted outside of the yeast cell in this mutant now build up inside the cell. But the most dramatic moment came when he looked, using the electron microscope, at sections of this cell. He called excitedly up to my office from down in the basement where the electron microscope was and I went down and I had a look. It was revelation to see a cell that ordinarily has only a sort of sparse collection of organelles but which instead in this mutant had, it was just dying of overload of the vesicles that were being produced, but couldn’t be delivered to the cell surface and so the cell has just accumulated lots of vesicles. That image stands in my mind as really the beginning of my career and I knew from that moment that I would be consumed for at least the next 20 years trying to figure it all out, so that was really a lucky break.;527;Creativity
Do you know how you are going to spend your Nobel Prize money?;"Unfortunately in my lifetime the funding of public higher education has gone down dramatically so for instance when I was a university student at UCLA I could work a summer job and pay fees and room and board and books for the rest of the year. My father had five kids and they all went to public institutions; he never had to pay anything. Now in US students have to assume the responsibility for their higher education themselves. They go into tremendous debt, there’s a trillion-dollar debt just owed to educational institutions in the US that just didn’t exist when I was growing up. I think this is a wholesale change in the political atmosphere that is I think really damaging, so I feel very strongly about this and as the result, the one action that I could do is that I donated my Nobel Prize money for the creation of an endowed chair at my institution so we can be as competitive as the private institutions and brining the best young scholars to Berkeley.
Watch the interview";527;How to Spend the Nobel money
Could you explain your Nobel Prize awarded work to young students?;To actually explain that one has to sort of introduce the subject in little broader terms. A person, I think most people would agree, is a person because of in the end of a person’s brain, which is where people think, plan and where all perceptions are collected and processed. I am a neuroscientist, I work on how the brain works which is an unbelievable big challenge because it’s a really quite amazing organ. In principle how the brain works is easy enough to explain. Billions and billions of nerve cells that constantly talk to each other and by talking to each other process information and at some point, come to some decision of doing something. What we have been doing over decades now, ever since I started in science, trying to understand how nerve cells in the brain communicate with each other so our contribution to science in a broad sense was to shed light on how a nerve cell speaks to another nerve cell and the way a nerve cell does that is via the specialized connection that is formed between these cells and the brain and that connection is called a synapse. And a synapse transfers information and processes information from one nerve cell to the next. It is a specialized junction between nerve cells that is not only there to relay information but also to change information, its own little nano computer. if you want to call it that. What we have done is to try to understand better how one cell sends out the information to the next cell at the synapse and ideally how also it processes that information and our major contributions I believe was in figuring out the basic fundamental molecular processes that govern this ability of a nerve cell in all brains, in all cells and in all animals.;528;Research
So basically, the communication is in the brain?;Fundamentally our work deals with trying to understand how brain cells communicate, yes. How exactly, what is the molecular basis, what are the genes, how do they work? What is the atomic structure? How are they regulated? How does their activity effect the overall brain? And how does that change in disease?;528;Meaning(Values) of Work
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Nobel Prize?;The question of what I was doing when I got the Nobel Prize call, a question that has been asked a thousand times. I think many people have listen to the call that was recorded and which I didn’t know and put on the website and I was driving in the middle of Spain trying to find a small city where I was supposed to go for a conference. Most people who live in the United States, if they have the fortune or luck or both to get such a call, most people are sleeping except if they expect it, and the usual procedure is as I understand, that you first get the call and then you are called and the recording is only done for the time you are called again, so most people are prepared. They know what they are going to do and my co-laureates already had showered when they got the call, so the situation was a little different for me because the first call never reached me. Adam Smith, who is part of Nobel Media I understand, was actually the one who called me and my first thought was quite honestly skeptic, skepticism, I was skeptic about the call, I felt that there was something not quite … It didn’t sound right that somebody with high-English accent would call you about that, so I was a little cautious, I was also a little sleepy because I hadn’t slept the night before of course, I was flying. I had to gather my wits and try to figure out whether that was actually a truthful call or a prank call.;528;Impact of Nobel prize on you
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;The question of sort of a major discovery point or single event is often asked. Most Nobel Prizes are given, I believe, for technical advances or because such moments are identifiable in the discovery of techniques, monoclonal antibodies, patch clamping and so on. Much fewer Nobel Prizes are actually given for discoveries of how something works, which is because, in my personal view, most discoveries of how something works are not discoveries that can be incapsulated in a single moment. The discoveries that require an incremental advance over many different experiments. If you want to understand the process, you can’t understand it in a single experiment. You have to approach it from many different angles. In my personal case the work that we performed that I think led to this prize was actually work that initiated 25 years ago and there were a lot of important observations, but in the end the promise of these observations only materialized or became more concrete very recently because continuing experiments in our lab backed them up, expanded them, explained them and gave them substance. I actually don’t think that there was any single eureka moment in my career, there were many small eureka moments, but not just one discovery, it’s in fact the whole question I am working on and I think that our work has contributed to understanding a process that involves or necessitates, more than understanding one little thing or one big thing, but understanding really how it works.;528;Creativity
Who is your role model, and why?;There is many people who have inspired me during my career. When I grew up I was probably most inspired by some of the teachers who I most admired, like music teachers for example, not science teachers I am afraid. I greatly admire and was tremendously influenced as a role model if you like by my mentors Joe Goldstein and Mike Brown who were my mentors in my post-doctoral training and who are Nobel Laureates. I think I have always admired people who have had the ability yo actually make discoveries that allow us to understand something and not only to discover a new approach and a new technique and I see this with Brown and Goldstein. I can also see that for example in the work that Bert Sakmann did after he won the Nobel Prize, which he won as you probably know for patch clamping, but afterwards he became a true, well actually he developed neuroscience in a way that I found very inspiring and so those are people I could mention here.;528;Mentors (Role models)
Is there anything else you would like to share with us?;The one thing that I always feel I would like to always express is that what I appreciated about the Nobel Prize in particular and what I think is absolutely essential for science, not only science, but for our societies and maybe even for civilization in a broad sense is that science operates purely or should operate purely by the idea of figuring out what the truth is about real things, but it is done by humans and humans are by their very nature never always truthful. I really appreciate about the Nobel Prize that historically it is has always been unbelievably well done, in the sense that the selection was … I can’t say this about my own case, but about previous cases were really based on scholarship and I think that is an enormous achievement. I think that that’s really what constitutes the value of the prize and I can only really congratulate the Nobel, I don’t know actually who does this, but I can only congratulate them on doing such a wonderful job.;528;Life
Professor ‘t Hooft, a key word in physics today, or one of the key words, is unification. There is a lot to talk about unification of forces, according to your mind is unification necessary?;"Gerardus ‘t Hooft: Usually there is a danger that one overemphasises the need for unification; it’s rather the other way around. The need in physics is understanding how things work and every now and then we have different regions of physics or different kind of forces or whatever, which give a problem when you try to combine them. We’re meeting problems and we understand that the situation as it exists is then not satisfactory because their forces cannot be combined in a proper way. We need in the overlap region a better theory that takes account of both sets of features of physics, say quantum mechanics and productivity or the weak force and the electromagnetic force or any such sort of different regions of physics where we have different forces or different phenomena which have to be combined. Then we won’t understand how it works and finally in practice the situation is very often this way that once we understood how to combine these different features in physics that you discover much to your surprise, that the utter theory contains more unification, it unifies.
But there’s a danger. People sometimes want to unify just for sake of unifying and then it doesn’t work. I’ve seen various examples of attempts to unify things which don’t need to be unified. There are examples of forces in nature which work perfectly well together without any further unification so then it is not necessary to unify. Then the attempt to unify may be misleading, we see this fairly often, say in the old days, when the elements were being discussed. The big question was how many elements do we have? Three elements, four elements? Water, fire, earth – how many? The correct answer turned to be 92 and more elements. There’s no unification, these were the elements and that was the correct answer. The attempt to unify was given more emphasis than it turned out to be correct at that stage of physics. Later we would discover how all the elements actually consist of the same kinds of matter but that had to be postponed until a different region of physics was being opened up.";69;Creativity
The December issue of Scientific American has a theme what science will be known in 2050 and Steven Weinberg there says that to unify the forces we need revolutionary new ideas in theoretical physics. Do you agree with that?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: Not necessarily, I think in this case he is correct but again, I will not put the emphasis on unification, I would put the emphasis on combined understanding. Right now we have a very deep problem in physics which is that on the one hand we have a theory of general relativity which describes the gravitational force in a remarkably accurate and beautiful way, so everybody believes general relativity is basically correct, a correct description of the gravitational force. On the other hand we also have quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics is an equally beautiful theory. The strange thing is that general relativity and quantum mechanics don’t seem to go together. There’s something very strange in physics. We have different sets of laws of physics, both are right, but they don’t go together. The point being that the domain of physics for quantum mechanics is relevant and the domain of physics where general relatively is valid in the ordinary experiences are very, very far separated. In ordinary experiments we never see the domain of physics where these two come together. But we can always fantasise, we can do Gedanken experiments and we can try to think what happens if both theories have to be applied together, then what? Very likely the resolution of this very deep problem will imply a kind of new unification but I think it’s dangerous to first try to unify and then try to understand. Its better first try to understand what’s going on and then we will see that the new theory will be more unified than before.;69;Future Research
Do you have any hobbies? Something you like to do in your free time?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: Oh yes, that’s quite a different question. I play some piano, I used to paint a lot to make pictures, drawings, for some time I haven’t done that anymore. Then I also collect shells which is a hobby of mine because every now and then I come to strange places for conferences, very often there is a beach so I like to go across that beach and pick up shells. It’s a very nice, you are alone with the sea and the sand and nothing else and I let my mind wander away. In the meantime I try to pick up beautiful shells. So that’s a hobby.;69;Life
I know that you practice music, often even together with your wife. What does music mean to your physics research?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: For me it’s just a way to relax. I never went into music in the same deep way as I went into physics. I realised that those composers whose music I like to play, like Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Debussy, that they are so far ahead in their expertise than I am that I can never improve on what they wrote down so I just play what they wrote. Because of this I realise that I’ll never be a very good musician because very good musicians they understand, they won’t play what somebody else has composed, they want to play their own pieces. I realised that I am playing music as an amateur but I like to do it just to relax.;69;Creativity
In your work you have a lot of rather complicated mathematical equations and I wonder when you think about them can you think about them or do you have to write them down or can you think about them while you walk in the wood or something?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: Both. What happens is that very often I think very deeply, I write down equations, try to work them out and run into problems because very often the equations are too complicated to solve or some other obstacle is found on my way and I don’t understand how to get beyond that obstacle. Then I sometimes have to relax and I’ll just sleep or something else and while just sleeping I try to simplify the problem as much as possible. I realise there here is this obstacle, what was the cause of this obstacle? Why couldn’t I solve it? There’s some very deep problem here, the equations were too complicated so now I do everything in my mind and then I’m forced to simplify. I simplify and I simplify and simplify and then the obstacle stands out very, very clearly and when you simplify things so much you often find a way around the obstacle. Next morning I go to my work and I work on the equations and I find the answer. That’s the way I very often work.;69;Research
How did you develop your interest in physics and research?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: From a very early age on I was interested in the laws of matter, of the abstract things in contrast to human beings who I thought they are far too complicated ever to understand. I didn’t understand, as a kid you, the human relations very well or what happened there just too complicated to me but on the contrary the laws of physics seemed to be honest, there’s no way to cheat on the laws of physics. Understanding those I thought would be much easier and much more interesting. From a very early age on I wanted to understand the laws of physics and I set myself as a goal to make new discoveries. I was thinking of making inventions but then later that became discoveries, I wanted to understand the laws, and that is as far as I remember. In the aeroplane to Stockholm here my mother gave me a picture taken of me when I was two years old and in the picture you see that I am studying a wheel and I’m really studying it, I want to understand what is a wheel, what makes it so special? Later, I don’t remember of course when I was two years old and I was studying a wheel, but I do remember that later I happened to see two wheels touching each other, of children’ bicycles or something like that, and you rotate one wheel and the other wheel starts to rotate as well, the transmission, and I was really intrigued by that. Those were laws of physics and I remember that I wanted to understand laws of physics. I remember that I always was very intrigued by what this world was made of and why. Then besides there were stories in my family and of course the heroes like Einstein and Planck and Schrödinger and so on who made all their beautiful discoveries and I wanted to be like them.;69;Motivation
In many countries the number of students interested in science seems to be decreasing. What is the situation in your country and what do you think can be done about it?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: The situation in my country is the same. The interest in science is decreasing at a rather alarming rate and we try to understand why that is so. I’m afraid I do understand why it is so, our field of physics and physics in general, it doesn’t have the glamour it use to have. Shortly after World War there was nuclear physics, there were the semi-conductors, the super-conductors, all these beautiful, marvellous, revolutionary inventions which were portrayed enormous big in the media and caught everybody’s imagination. The more recent achievements of physics do not compare with those. We still find very many interesting things in physics, but they don’t catch the same imagination and interest by the people because it gets to abstract, people don’t understand any more what science is. When the glamour is taken away they now see all the negative sides of science, they see the negative sides of nuclear physics, they see the negative side of too much television. Science is put in a much more negative light than it used to be and I think as a consequence people are turning away from science. On top of that what irritates me rather a bit is that on very many popular movies and scenes on television, television is a very important medium, so very often on television you see a movie and the big hero is never a scientist, the big hero is a lawyer. The kids are inspired by that, they want to be a lawyer just like the hero they see on television. I can’t blame them, I think it’s understandable what’s happening but of course we don’t like it.;69;Motivation
A somewhat related question is a question of women in science. If we look back to the Nobel Prizes during the 20th century, they’re almost all or a majority are men. Do you think the same will be true for the 21st century or will there be a change?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: I’ve no idea. I don’t see why women should be any worse scientists than men so that’s for certain. But indeed, as you say, in practice it is men who make the big discoveries, at least percentage wise much more of them than women. I’m sure it doesn’t have to be like this. What the cause of this is I do not understand, I don’t know. I can guess but my guess won’t be any better than your guess what the cause of that is.;69;Diversity in Science
Are there any special moves in that direction in Holland, to interest girls in science in the early ages?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: Of course you always try to get girls interested in science. Unfortunately in my field it seems as if theoretical physics is an absolute minimum. There’s practically no branch of science with fewer girls or women in that branch of science than theoretical physics, even in mathematics or experimental physics or other branches of science you see more women but not in theoretical physics. I think it’s very unfortunate. I wish it were different.;69;Diversity in Science
What do you think is different between being a student today and when you were a student?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: Our field is evolving very rapidly. In my field, but now I’m only talking about my field, these 30 years since we made our discoveries enormously much has happened. It’s very unfortunate but there are developments in our field that nobody could foresee and nobody can change but it seems to be that the most ardent questions in our field are those which we mentioned earlier in this interview. We mentioned about Weinberg, unification of gravitation and practical physics but it is very unlikely that one will be able to do direct experiments in such a field. That is a big change, when we did our work experimental physics and theoretical physics were going hand in hand and they are together solving the problems of our world. Now the experimentalists have a very hard time in getting deeper into the structure of matter because they have to be extremely clever, they make very, very large machines and they get effect of 10 improvement in resolving the structure of matter and its always very important, then perhaps another factor of 10 very important. But in our field, in theoretical physics, you’re not talking about factors of 10 but about 10 factors of 10 so factors of 10 billion or even 100’s of millions of billions. Such factors where the unification of gravity with matter becomes important. Unfortunately we cannot make a machine that is 10 billion times as powerful as the machines we have at present, those would have to be 10 billion times as big and that we cannot make. Experiments cannot be done at that stage. That means that these are very esoteric regions of physics, very abstract and very vague and mysterious and it worries me a lot that this may perhaps not be physics at all. The striking thing is that nevertheless in spite of the absence of direct experiments progress is being made very, very slowly and I don’t know how things will continue in the future but that is very a big difference with what our field was thirty years ago.;69;Life
There is a lot of talk about the elusive Higgs particle and how important it would be. What would be the consequences according to you if it is not found?;"Gerardus ‘t Hooft: The present theory does predict the Higgs. If it is not found then the theory would not really work properly. In fact the situation would become very confusing at those energy scales where we would have expected the Higgs. If the Higgs is not found there then something else must happen. In practice some kind of particle must exist in place of all of the Higgs. One thing is that the Higgs doesn’t have to be an elementary particle, it could be a composite object. That is not so strange, that has been thought of many times before and it could be a possibility. But if that is so then we have to understand all those new forces at work which create composite particles at that energy range and it would definitely mean that there is very, very much new physics taking place. The way theory is now, a theory with no Higgs is not very different to a theory where the Higgs is very, very heavy. Having no Higgs is in some formal sense the limit where the Higgs mass goes to infinity. That limit is ill-defined, the theory is ill-defined you have to have something else going on then.
If they find no Higgs at all that will make our world much more interesting than if they find a Higgs exactly in the region where most people expect it, because then we don’t need new physics just around the corner. If there’s no Higgs we need no physics and that means that the future machines which will increase their power by a factor of 10 or a factor of 100, those new machines will produce many, many new objects which we have no idea about at present. Quite generally speaking it would make life very interesting if they don’t find the Higgs where it is expected to be. But I think they will find the Higgs and I think it will be found where it is expected to be and then the problem is of course what then, because then the standard model again shows that it survives another factor of 10 and no /- – -/ need for further particles is there although the standard model as it is it cannot be the ultimate truth. Now it’s not obvious that new machines will find anything new even if they get a factor 100 or so beyond the present energy. We simply will be in a more difficult situation if they do find a Higgs. In any case, whatever they will find, no Higgs or Higgs it will always be interesting because we have no good clue as to why the Higgs has the mass it has. No matter what, the Higgs could be 100 gv it could be a 1,000 gv or anything in between or when its 2,000 that’s practically synonymous to having no Higgs and that would make the world very, very interesting. In all these cases you have to ask the next question: Why this particular Higgs mass?";69;Research
I wonder is there some subject except physics that you’re interested in?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: I like to read the science pages of the newspapers, in particular astronomy, so I very much like to see the features defined in other planets. I like the recent discoveries in the recent field of biology, I’ve read this book by Dawkins, The selfish gene and this was a revelation to me that finally biology is becoming scientific as far as I am concerned. I didn’t understand biology before because my teachers used to say that birds have wings otherwise they can’t fly but that wasn’t a satisfactory explanation to me, other creatures have no wings and they don’t need to fly. Why are there birds with wings and why are there birds without wings and so on. There may need to be other answers and those new developments answer that question in a much more satisfactory way than I’ve seen before. I like those branches of science.;69;Motivation
One of the questions coming in to the Nobel site from students is the following, it’s about the electron and the question is the following: Now the electron is known to be or assumed to be point like particle, still it has a mask. It is therefore considered to be a tiny black hole?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: You might if you want call the electron a tiny black hole but it doesn’t make sense. The reason is that the electron is too light. If you were to compute the size of that black hole you would get a size much, much smaller than was believed to be the smallest existing size in nature. When you try to describe it as black hole you are pushing things too far. However, there’s another thing we might consider which is the point like particles such as electrons, neurons and heavier particles, they form whole families and it is not obvious whether they are the most heaviest point particles, it’s not clear where it will stop, so there could be heavier and heavier and heavier particles. Eventually those particles might blend with the black holes but only if they are billions and billions times as heavy as the electron. Then it becomes sensible to describe such particles as black holes but not particles as light as the electron. It could be that there’s a gradual change from black holes to particles and that the exact boundary, this is a particle, this is a black hole, the exact boundary may be not impossible to indicate or be irrelevant. But to call the electron a black hole wouldn’t make much sense.;69;Research
The last few decades has seen a very rapid development of electronic communication and electronic publishing. What does it mean for collaboration between scientists, do you think?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: It changes our world. Nowadays scientists are using internet all the time and we send all our papers to the net and it seems as if the net is replacing already the scientific journals much to the regret of the publishers. In practice we find that those journals are hardly needed any more because we have all those papers which are on the internet so whenever someone wants a paper one just clicks into the internet site and finds the paper and we don’t have to look up the journal anymore, its quicker. In practice the electronic revolution – and I think it is a revolution – is changing our field dramatically. I don’t know what will be coming next, I’m looking forward to the time in the distant future when it will be unnecessary to use paper anymore, that we only work from screens. Right now the situation is still such that although we use the screen to write our papers and to devise our texts in practice whenever we want to study the paper we make a printout and we make all this waste of paper. Since the electronic revolution more paper is being used than before because we all make these printouts. I’m wondering when that will end, that we will no longer feel the need to make a printout because the screen is so versatile and so flexible that it’s easier to work with the screen and it’s no longer necessary or sensible to make a printout. But that will be the distant future.;69;Creativity
The electronic age, would that change in any way the competition between individuals or groups working?;Gerardus ‘t Hooft: I think it makes the competition a bit more honest at least for those people who have access to the internet. Everybody with access to the internet and nowadays it is nearly everybody even developing countries have access to internet at least many of them and they can now participate in the process. They don’t have to subscribe to expensive journals because they can link onto any of the papers that any other groups could also reach. You can find everything on the net. As soon as you have access to the net you can participate fully with the whole process of science, at least in my field because the theoretical physics as you know basically requires just pure thought and you are processing the experimental data which can also be found on the net and in theory that’s all you really need, at least in my field. In former days it was more difficult to get hold of information particularly if you were living in either a developing country or in the old days in the Cold War when you were behind the iron curtain it was very hard to get information in time. People were often half a year or so behind developments because they couldn’t get the information. That has not changed. On the other hand of course if there are countries which are so poor that they don’t have the access to the computers, access to the net and then you have a problem, those really can’t participate.;69;Environment
Professor Veltman, you have long experience of research, teaching and students in the United States, and in Europe, what would you say are the main differences between the United States and Europe in this respect?;Martinus Veltman: The main difference, at least in Holland, I think on the average I got students of a higher level. This is something that you never know for sure and sometimes you get much better students in America as well of course, but on the average, and that’s because of the difference between the American and European system. In America, students get different shares of and the best go to Harvard and the next one goes to Princeton and the next one goes to Yale, and we got sort of number ten. So that is a pre-selection in America, and in Holland there is no pre-selection, and generally in Europe there is not accepted /- – -/ England. So the consequence is that we got student of which the best we had selected out in America.;70;Environment
What is the difference between being a student today and when you were a student? Being a student today and when you were a student.;"Martinus Veltman: The difference now as then? I don’t know, it was less disciplined. In my student time you could do nothing for a few years and then start working again and I liked that a lot, I did do nothing for a number of years.
But today in Europe that’s no more possible because they stop supporting you and so on, and they make the system such that you cannot do it. I’m very strongly in favour of a system where someone can momentarily go out and later on come back again. For whatever reason. Maybe he’s not mature enough, or maybe he wants to have other experiences. But the present day systems compare as, and that was the way the system was in my time. Today I think that is no more possible, very difficult. Is it possible here in Sweden that you can study for a very long time without you being kicked out of the University?";70;Life
"I don’t really know; can you get kicked out?";Martinus Veltman: Of course it happens very seldom and it is the one ray of hope in the life of many miserable people!;70;Environment
What is really a Higgs particle?;"Martinus Veltman: A Higgs particle is just one of the many particles that are part of the game of the standard model, but the special thing about a Higgs particle and the reason that we are talking so much about it, is because we know which experiments to do to get at it. There are many things in the standard model that we don’t understand, we don’t know why there are three generations, we don’t know why the top quark is so heavy, or the bottom quark, of all these quarks, we don’t know why the towers are so heavy. We know nothing, there are so many of these questions, but we do not know what experiment to do to find an answer to these questions.
Now in the case of the Higgs particle we know what experiment to do to get an answer. We must go to /- – -/ of the order of 500 GeV and then you will have access, you should either make the extr,a see something, so what is special about Higgs I would say is mainly because it’s accessible to experiments. So we’re talking a lot about it, and we know how to make a machine that looks at it, but there are many other questions I would just as well want to know the answer to, except I don’t know how to go about it.";70;Research
What would be the consequences if this elusive Higgs particle isn’t found?;Martinus Veltman: Well, by all the rules of logic, which I believe do apply in particle physics, we will have to find something, because it has to appear as some sort of a cut off in intervals that we have observed here or there, so we see a /- – -/ correction to which either the Higgs or whatever goes for its contributes, so we know there is something there, unless of course the rules of logic don’t hold any more, then everything stops. So don’t ever say what would happen if we don’t see it, I think that would mean that there’s something wrong with the rules of logic and that we cannot have. So far that’s not the way it works.;70;Research
I wonder how did you develop your interest in research and physics?;Martinus Veltman: I don’t know, like most of us, we go into the domain of particle physics and you start with an experiment and you see results coming, and you find it very exciting discovering new particles and interactions and stuff, and my whole life which started out by looking at a neutrino experiment, and that experiment was a total failure otherwise, but standing there and seeing these events coming and seeing these reaction coming, and try to guess what’s going on, it’s a very exciting something. It’s like entering a domain that no other person has been before. That’s the very wonderful stuff about this. And in physics, you are in another domain, unknown, you are truly an explorer. I liked that very much. It’s a pity that much of what you see today is no more so simple, but at that time that was like that. So that has always fascinated me from the first day that I saw it onwards.;70;Motivation
One of the primary goals of physics is to understand the wonderful variety of nature in a unified way, the December issue of the Scientific American has the theme What science will be known in 2050. 50 years from now. Do you share Steven Weinberg‘s … when he says that a unified theory of all forces probably requires radical new ideas?;"Martinus Veltman: Well, it’s usually what I find these things very annoying, if not stupid, because there is nothing in nature that says that we should have unifying field series, we could equally well have non-unified field series, that’s up to nature to do it. We don’t know about it. So I don’t know why these people are always talking about united field series. I really don’t know, I honestly don’t know, and the unfortunate thing is that on top of it in the past 20 years or so they have been making propaganda of us having unified the weak and the electromagnetic interactions, but if you look at it, there’s been no unification. None whatsoever. The electric coupling constant is independent of the weak coupling constant so what’s the unification? I honestly don’t know, and the main unification is that you write the laws on the same page.
Other than that I honestly don’t know what is this unification they talk about. It’s SU(2) cross U(1) remember? SU(2) is weaker but actually U(1) is electro magnetism, there’s a cross in between, they are not connected. So I don’t know why they talk about unification. They only do it to sell it, and then they speak about unified field series, because people have been told this so often because Mr. Einstein has been saying these things for a while, but it is, in my opinion, not a correct thing to say.  Nature is whatever nature is. If nature is unified – fine. If nature is not unified – fine too. There is no intrinsic law in physics that says that we should have a unified gauge series, and so far we don’t have any and moreover have no indication of that, and even unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions is a pseudo unification, it’s not a real one, despite what they say.";70;Future Research
I wonder is there some other subject that interests you except physics?;Martinus Veltman: Oh yes. We don’t want to talk about that. I used to always to be very interested in electronics and things like that, so it’s sorts of pseudo physics and making computer programs and stuff like that. It’s not always in the same domain. I am not good in things like music or the arts, so there I have, well, I have some interest but I’m not very good at it. So beyond physics, well I guess I’m sort of a professional idiot. Physics, well, and surrounding things in all honesty.;70;Career Devleopment
Some people say that the 20th century was a century for physics and that the 25th century would be that on biology, what do you think about that?;Martinus Veltman: I don’t think anything about it because you know perfectly well if you had put such a question to somebody in 1899 he would for sure have given you the wrong answer. He would not have known Max Planck who did his invention the first year in 1900 which changed everything, and this you cannot know. Research brings you into situations you didn’t know. We don’t know what’s going on and maybe physics comes to some sort of a dead end, if we sort of get bogged down in the Higgs sector one way or the other, and if you don’t know how to follow that up then that might be a very hard time for particle physics and it might be another century before we get over that. But you never know. You know it, you have, think of the difference in life that we had when you and I started to know, gigantic difference, and you couldn’t have guessed it. Could we have guessed at ’65 what we have today?;70;Role of Science
But does it change something in terms of competition between people and groups?;Martinus Veltman: It probably does but I don’t know to what extent. Everything goes faster and quicker and so on, so I have no experience with it, how it is today. I notice that still the same people are accusing the other people of not quoting properly, many things remain as they always were.;70;Environment
Doesn’t it exist for you – spare time.;"Martinus Veltman: It exists and it doesn’t exist because I was very free all of my life. Most of my life I never had to set an alarm clock, and I would have like two or three lectures a week, and the rest of the time you do research, talk to students, what have you. Now going on retirement, well of course the students have disappeared out of my life, but for the rest it doesn’t change so much. You just, I’m used to keeping myself busy one way or the other, what I do a little bit more today is taking long walks, because you need some movement to keep your body in shape, so I do that for that purpose.
Other than that my life is very much as it was over the past 40 years. It doesn’t change that much. That’s the nice thing about this profession, you know. It would be different if I were an experimentalist because there you need an experimental environment and all kinds of things and I don’t need that, all I need is my hat, and as long as there is no hole in there it’s okay.";70;Free time
You received the last prize of this century. Most Nobel Prize winners of this century are men, do you think that we will see a change in that in the next century and what would be the causes on this dominance of men?;Martinus Veltman: This is a very difficult question because you know that I have a daughter who did her thesis also in this high energy physics, she did her thesis with Mary Gaillard if you know that lady, from Berkeley. So I’ve seen it with my daughter, extra difficult if you are a woman, and they are serious, they’re really serious, that puts an extra degree of complication on your relationship. When you sit together with a man there’s always some tension in the room, in the collaboration, only if you work together with other women that’s not there but then that happens very rarely because there are not enough women. So what happens is that these women are there and they have a problem of finding a good collaboration and well usually there it goes usually wrong one way or the other. It’s very difficult, it’s very difficult. So in a sense they are more isolated than everybody else, because there’s always sex playing a role. You can’t help it.;70;Diversity in Science
What does this Nobel Prize mean to you?;Martinus Veltman: Well, that’s often asked of me, but I have no ready-made answer. I think if anything it means of course appreciation of the things you did in the past which I always thought people had more or less forgotten. So I’m happy that they didn’t forget it, what can I say? Every man of course likes to have appreciation for what he did, so in this I’m no different from anybody else. Money wise it doesn’t mean that much to me because I had a comfortable existence anyway. So well it’s nice to be recognised. But after that I think I will go back to my existence and live quietly, so as far as that goes it will probably not make so much of a difference. So to a large extent it’s in your own head. I think that’s right, yes;70;Impact of Nobel on you
Do people ask you questions about physics when you are at parties with non-physicists?;Martinus Veltman: Oh no. No. If they do I may start, but after about two minutes they walk away! No problem! Sometimes I do and I go at it full /- – -/ but it is certainly at a party it’s not possible, just not possible, so you give that up. The only way to do it would be as some organised contacts, give lectures or so, and I plan to do that a little bit more than I did in the past. But in ordinary life we never get to deal with this. Not that I, no, never.;70;Motivation
How do you consider the discussion about the muon collider versus the linear e+ e-?;Martinus Veltman: I’ve looked at them but I’m not too clear about what kind of knowledge they would add and so I can’t really tell you. I have listened to them but I’m not clear about it. Especially the muon collider, I don’t know what it will do.;70;Creativity
One of the questions coming in to the website was the following: The electron is supposed to be a point like particle without any dimensions, but still it has a mass, can you therefore consider it as that a little mini black hole?;Martinus Veltman: This question you must not direct to me, you must direct it to ‘t Hooft. You will not get an answer, but it will sound very impressive what he will tell you.;70;Research
What do you most enjoy about science?;“What I enjoy about it is you’re trying to figure out how the world works. I love the idea of cumulative knowledge – by experiment, observation and quantitative analysis you get closer to what you think is going on. And that accumulates over time. It’s not just one person or one set of time but over many hundreds of years.”;74;Motivation
Who has inspired you?;"“There are numerous people that I met when I was in college, in graduate school and beyond. People whose general interest in science really drives them well beyond job security or even getting Nobel Prizes.
For example, Charles Townes the inventor of the laser died at 99, almost 100. And up until the last year or two of his life he was working. I remember calling him up when he was about 95 or 96. I wanted to talk to him about something – it was a Saturday afternoon – and I called home and his wife answered. I said, ‘Oh Frances is Charles there?’ And she said, ‘Steve! It’s Saturday! He’s at work, he’s never home Saturday.’ And I was also at work – I still work on Saturdays.
This is part of why science is so wonderful – the people who do it really love doing it.”";74;Mentors (Role models)
Is it important to do work that has an impact on society?;"“As a citizen I hope that all people, whether they are scientists or not would think about what is happening in the world around them.
Scientists have a special place in the sense that they have perhaps a higher ability to understand many of the issues that society faces where science gives guidance. Science doesn’t say you have to do this and you have to do that. But science does tell you – if for example the ozone layer is being threatened by certain chemicals in the atmosphere – what’s the cause of it, what’s happening and then society has to respond to it. The same is true of health and clean water, clean air and finally of climate change.”";74;Roles of Science
Why is water such an important issue right now?;"“Water is necessary for life. We among the planets on our solar system have a very special place. Seventy percent of the earth’s surface is water but that water is salt water. What really sustains life is fresh water.
Fresh water is produced by the heat of the sun, evaporation, rain or snow – and our fresh water resources are being much more strained in part because of the rising population. In addition to the rising population, is rising wealth so more and more people can afford and demand more meat in their diet. That means you have to grow more food but also more food for livestock that then use that food to generate meat for people to eat. This all puts a strain on the water supplies.”";74;Roles of Science
How is climate change shaping water on earth?;"“Over the last couple of decades there’s much more evidence that the climate is changing and a large factor is due to humans. It’s something where as time goes by we’re finding that the earth has a very hair-trigger response to slight changes.
Already with a one degree rise we see weather in the last couple of decades has dramatically turned. But that’s just the tip of what we’re going to be seeing. Most of the impacts will be later in this century and in the next several hundred years.
For example glaciers, particularly in Antarctica, are beginning to slide. The ice is beginning to roll down, sort of like a slow-motion avalanche when once it’s going you can’t stop it until you’ve reestablished a friction grounding line. Even if you decrease the temperature it will require decades in order for it to slow down and stop. This is something we did not expect.
We also know as a matter of history, not climate models, that in a world one degree warmer than today the average sea level was six to nine metres higher than today. We used to think that it would take several thousand years [to reach that], now we think it’s going to be a few hundred years.
A six to nine metre rise in sea level would mean that central London is underwater. Ten percent of the world’s population lives within ten metres of sea level. Because that’s now expected to happen much faster that means you’re going to get displaced people from sea water rises.”";74;Future research (interests)
What can we do to tackle this problem?;“There’s an increasing number of scientists and engineers who recognise this is such a problem that they’re beginning to shift careers, as I have done. I have tried to encourage other scientists – if you have any knowledge or talent and think you can do something – to invent better batteries for electric vehicles, better energy storage, better distribution systems.”;74;Creativity
Has receiving the Nobel Prize helped you in this work?;“One could say it gives you more voice, but in the end what gives you the voice is not a prize you might have but what you’re saying. That’s the beautiful thing about science.”;74;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I just would like to start off the interview for the official website. Welcome Professor Osheroff to this interview. And really start off with asking you something about your childhood. It seems like you really liked experimenting at the time. There are some amazing stories that we have been able to read about. Can you tell us some?;Douglas Osheroff: It’s absolutely true that I led a wild childhood. I guess it started at age six when I tore the locomotive for this electric set I’d just gotten for Christmas apart to get the electric motor out. I think my parents didn’t scold me. I think my father was quite fascinated with my fascination. As time went on … He was a physician in town, and his patients would obviously give him things to give to me. I was one of five children. I don’t know if they all got quite that much attention, but some of things, like a box of parts from the telephone company and a box of magnets and stuff like this, and I just found all of this stuff so fascinating.;78;Life
There was once an explosion and you came running up with cuts in your face?;Douglas Osheroff: This was, I can’t remember who told me, you could buy calcium carbide at a hardware store. The idea was to put it in moles’ runways. It generates acetylene gas when the calcium carbide gets in contact with water, and that would drive out the moles. But you could take a soda pop bottle, fill it mostly full of water, drop in one of these grains of calcium carbide, and then jam the rubber stopper with a glass tube that was pulled to a fine point so there was just a very small orifice. You had to wait until all the oxygen was out of the bottle, and then you would light this and you can see an intense white flame. This is essentially a miner’s lamp. It was fun. But it would go for, I don’t know, a minute or something or less and then you’d have to open it up and put another one in. I thought I would make one differently that would run for hours. I took a 500-millilitre beaker and filled it full of calcium carbide. I had a long burette, so it would drip water into this thing, and then there was a delivery tube. I didn’t think about the fact that there was such a much larger volume in this thing. I waited what seemed like an appropriate period of time and then I lit this. I got a blue flame rather than this brilliant white flame. I instinctively knew enough to move my head like this. This thing blew up. I went like this and it blew up. I had glass in the side of my face, which would have gone in my eye if I hadn’t been luckier. My mother was up fixing dinner and she hears this explosion downstairs and she comes to the top of the stairs – I was in the basement. I’m coming up the stairs cupping my hands to keep the blood from dripping on the carpet. I was so famous for practical jokes that she of course couldn’t trust anything I did, so she says, “If you’re kidding I’ll kill you!” I was old enough to drive and I drove myself down to my father’s office and he sewed up the largest of the cuts. This had happened so many times before.;78;Creativity
But they went with it? They were okay? They really encouraged you though?;Douglas Osheroff: Yes. After that I stopped playing with calcium carbide. There was an unwritten agreement between us: if I did something really stupid I would simply stop doing that. I was usually quite happy because there were so many things and there wasn’t enough time anyway.;78;Family/Home Environment
You were very young when this amazing discovery was made early in your twenties. Were you aware of what you were on to, together with Professor Lee and Professor Richardson, or was it sheer hard work and you knew there was something, but did you know exactly what you were coming up?;"Douglas Osheroff: Let me go back a little bit if I can. When I was a kid, again there five of us, and we would go for walks along long deserted logging roads that wound their way into the Hemlock Forest that surrounded Aberdeen. We would imagine that we were pioneers, explorers, that we were the first humans that had ever been on the roads. A contradiction in terms I suppose, but I’ve always wanted to be an explorer, and when I went to Cornell, Bob Richardson gave a talk on a new refrigeration technology that gave the promise of allowing man to look at nature in a new and different realm. I wanted to be one of the people. That was when I decided I would go into low temperature physics. I went in with the idea that there would be some excitement associated with it and everything. But my fifth year of graduate study, the experiment I was doing was based on some very, what appeared to be very, exciting work by one of our competitors. When I went into first reproduce that, then go beyond it, we found that that work was all wrong and that the actual effect was easily calculated. I kept looking for small deviations from the existing theory. What I like to say is if I continued on that experiment I probably would be a taxi cab driver of New York City or something like that.
But luckily one day there were two other students that had patiently been waiting for the only NMR iron core electromagnet in the lab, so high enough homogenating stability to do NMR. Eventually they went to Dave Lee and Bob Richardson and they agreed that I had to relinquish this magnet which I’d been monopolising for three months. It was only after that that I did a curiosity driven experiment, which in fact gave the first evidence that we’d seen a new phase transition. The refrigeration technology was a mixture of liquid and solid helium three, and we didn’t know whether the phase transition, this curve that we saw, was giving evidence of was in the liquid or the solid. The first publications we made we were wrong. I mean all the data was correct, but the interpretation was all wrong. We’d said it was all in the solid, but it wasn’t. This was exactly what I’d felt I’d been born for and I wasn’t going to just stop. I kept trying to come up with better and better ways of probing what was going on inside this mixture at this very, very low temperature where one couldn’t see what was happening.";78;Creativity
But you knew you had something amazing there, but did you expect that you would get the prize?;Douglas Osheroff: When we did the work I think that our attitude was that this other person that had done this wrong experiment that got me into the parameter space where we could make the discovery, if he’d made that discovery we felt he would have gotten the Nobel Prize. But we didn’t think that we would, at least that was my personal feeling. I think it was probably 1976 we were awarded the Simon Memorial Prize, which is an international prize, a British prize. I guess it was only shortly after that that people started telling me that they had nominated me for the Nobel Prize. Now of course you’re not supposed to do that, but I think a lot of people do. For years I would hear this and get nervous every October, and how many years can you get nervous every October? I think eventually I made a conscious decision I would simply ignore this whole business of it, it seemed unlikely after 20-some years that it would happen. But having made the discovery, in any event it opened enormous doors for me and I had lots of opportunities. Just going to Bell Laboratories was a fantastic thing for me.;78;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What was so amazing with Bell, just in some brief words, because it seems like a number of laureates have been working at Bell’s and had a good connection to Bell? What was so amazing for you there?;Douglas Osheroff: For one thing you know you were surrounded by so many of the best scientists, for me physicists, in the country, indeed in the world. The reason I left Bell Labs, because I don’t think I ever could have done that on my own, my wife had always thought of me as a frustrated professor waiting to be born. I would go around New Jersey giving demonstration lectures on low temperature physics to high school kids and middle school, even grade school kids.;78;Creativity
"The students seem to be very happy as well; you have won an award for excellency in teaching. How did you feel about that?";Douglas Osheroff: It happened fairly early actually. I came to Stanford and there was an intermediate lab sequence for physics majors that had actually been – the structure of this thing was more or less worked out by someone else – but it was all low temperature, all based on physics at low temperatures. I took over this thing. Everyone said they thought I had a really light teaching load, but all of this was an incredible amount of work. I guess I created this course a little bit, tailored it for what I felt I wanted to do. The kids seemed to really enjoy it a lot. They worked awfully hard. I taught that course for ten years. It’s very difficult teaching anything for ten years. You have to really, really love it to do that. At some point I would like to go back and teach that again.;78;Advice for young researchers
On a daily basis, how do you keep the creativity going? How do you get that energy to encourage the students or is it just environment in itself that creates that?;Douglas Osheroff: No. I have to say that the environment at Stanford is certainly a wonderful environment, but for me, I don’t have theorists who are waiting on. Even if I worked back at Bell Labs right now, the field helium three physics is a mature field and I’m a little bit surprised that I’m still in it I suppose. But I still find it fascinating and I still find it very good training for students.;78;Creativity
I would like to ask you, you have told us and I have read that you have been part of the Columbia Accident Investigation Team, the accident that happened year 2003. You had said briefly that it was good for the team, the investigation team, to have a Nobel Laureate on, it’s your speculation. But you came to really have a very, very important role in this investigation. Will you tell us the way you saw your role and what it actually came to be?;"Douglas Osheroff: Yes. People, as soon as they heard that I had been offered a spot on the board, people immediately said, “Oh you will be the Richard Feynman of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.” I quickly said, “I can’t fill those shoes.” But in some sense I suppose I did end up being kind of the Richard Feynman of the thing in that I was the only one that did an experiment, but it was a very different experiment. Feynman basically, some people said he was put up to it, but if he was he was a wonderful showman and I think he made his point extremely well, dumped this rubber O ring in ice water and showed that it became hard. This is nothing that the engineers at Morton Thiokol hadn’t known back, even the morning before the accident.
First let me say I joined late and so most everything was being covered. People were looking at the organisational aspects of the accident. I was a member of a group that was trying to establish with as much certainty as possible the physical origins of the accident. Every time I tried to do something I found that I was infringing on someone else’s turf so to speak and it was a bit complicated.";78;Career Devleopment
But you even took and made some experiments at home to prove that what you were suggesting was true?;"Douglas Osheroff: Yes. The first thing I did is decide what I should really do is look over people’s shoulder to make sure that what they’re doing is reasonable and complete and all of this stuff. It was a very professional bunch of investigators, most of whom had a lot of expertise in safety investigations or knew NASA like the back of their hand or whatever. They were all people who had much more reason to be there than I did. I did that for a while. Then I said, “Is there something that’s not being covered here?” I realised that no one was worrying about why the foam fell off in the first place, and so I started looking at that and doing a bunch of calculations and stuff like that. It didn’t look like NASA’s model made any sense, just because the heat couldn’t propagate through the foam fast enough to do what it had to do. But then we said, “Well, maybe the heat is being generated internally by vibrations and things.” Then I asked a different question: If in fact you suddenly start building up pressure inside the foam, how does that pressure propagate through to the surface? Does it do that in a manner which is consistent with throwing off foam? I designed a very simple experiment. It cost me about $100. I mean some of the stuff we had lying around, but if you had to buy it all to start with maybe it would have been $300 or something. We did this experiment. We got a very clear answer, which was that the pressure created a plainer fracture which propagated up and intersected a section normal to the surface. All the motion of the foam was normal to the surface and that wouldn’t throw any foam off. We did this experiment under various different conditions over and over again; always got the same result.";78;Creativity
What did NASA say to your findings and has it been established, or are you seen as the bad boy, so to speak, of having insisted that this is the problem?;Douglas Osheroff: No, I don’t think I was the bad boy because of that. I was the bad boy because I think Nobel Laureates have a tendency to talk to the press a lot more than for instance Air Force Generals, who are in the business of doing safety investigations. The thing that really got me in trouble was talking to the press. There was one particular interview, which was August 1st, that’s my birthday, and anyone can figure out who it was, but the reporter had asked me a simple question, which was, Did I think that we were writing a good report? because it was supposed to come out in less than a month? I said, Well, it depends. I think the people that wrote the Rogers Commission Report thought they had written a good report. But then over time I think they could see that NASA’s regard for safety had relaxed back to the pre-Challenger accident level. Then surely when this accident occurred they must have concluded that in fact the report had not done what they hoped it would do. I think the only way we can have written a good report is if we get NASA to change their culture in a way that will not relax back. That was the first time that NASA realised, evidently, that that was going to be in our report.;78;Roles of Science
Do you approve of men in space so to speak, to send people up in a space shuttle, or do you think it should be done in a different way until all the safety measures have been taken care of?;Douglas Osheroff: I think ‘approve’, I would not use that term. I think that there’s no moral or ethical questions here. I think the astronauts realise the dangers involved. I think that if you look at the survival rate of astronauts it’s probably higher than the survival rate of test pilots, particularly those that are testing military aircraft. It is a risky business. I think for various reasons it is politically not tolerable for astronauts to die in the line of work. That’s a reality and I don’t think that we’re going to change. These are all heroes and how can we stand by and watch heroes die, and particularly stand by and watch heroes die because of a blind spot that NASA had in their management? I think it’s not so bad that there were two accidents, but the fact that both of these accidents could and should have been avoided, I think that is the point that’s been hard for NASA to live with and to understand.;78;Roles of Science
I just thought I would start off by asking you … During the banquet, the speech that your co-laureate was holding, Professor David Lee, he said that it was a very exciting time there in the beginning of the 1970s, those months that you were working together on the experiments. How would you describe those days, those months?;Robert C. Richardson: I have to agree with Dave. It was a very, very exciting and surprising. Dave Lee recruited me to go to Cornell to work on experiments that were designed to do something entirely different, but they were related. It was to try to cool liquid and solid helium to very low temperatures and look for a phase transition in solid helium-3, and we were doing these experiments. I came and helped start a part of the program and my speciality was nuclear magnetic resonance. Then we had this fantastic graduate student named Douglas Osheroff that came and took over the project. In the American tradition the graduate student’s hands are the ones that have to do the work and I’m not permitted to take the soldering iron out of the graduate students’ hands. It’s just a joy to interact with Doug. When these unusual and bizarre experimental results came along, we would just stay up sometimes until six in the morning and then I’d have a lecture to give in a class at eight o’clock. I would just be thinking about it and worrying about where it was going and what it meant. In the spring of 1972, I can remember just not feeling tired at all, but just elated because night after night it would be thinking and talking. We had a spectacular aurora borealis in our part of New York in the summer of 1972 and Doug and I would talk about it in the morning as we were going home. Looking up in the sky, it was as though there was some special reward that was coming because of the excitement that we were having in it.;79;Impact of Nobel on you
The working together, the co-working between the three of you, the working together, how important is that do you think to really move on and be creative?;Robert C. Richardson: There are certain areas of science where people work in very, very large teams. In high energy physics there might be hundreds of people because they’re building very big detectors and things. Our work was still manageable, that is there were little pieces of equipment like this that could get made on the lathe by the graduate students themselves and developed techniques for making bellows move and creating magnetic field gradients and so forth. A big team’s not important but having a constant interaction to look back and forth, Yes, let’s do this and Let’s call this that, it really made it fun. I cannot imagine how it would be any fun at all to be working alone. It was more fun in discussion.;79;Creativity
I can understand. How did you come up with the idea to become a scientist? Was it something that you wanted right from a small age, or was it something that happened during your student years?;Robert C. Richardson: That’s a very interesting and complicated question. I went to a public school in Virginia in a Washington suburb. It was a very good school. I made pretty good grades. I went to a public college in my state, at Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute. I had a vague thought, I can do these math things, I’ll be an engineer maybe. I started taking engineering and I really found that there was too much repetition in that and my favourite subjects were English literature and history and mathematics, so maybe I’ll be a chemistry major. I started taking chemistry courses, some were required. I was taking one course and I’d made very good grades, without really having to work very hard by the way, in chemistry. I was taking one course called quantitative analysis where you’re supposed to figure out just how much of a certain compound is in a mixture. In order to get the right result, you had to do something called titration where you would release a certain amount, a drop at a time, a colour indicator, phenolphthalein into the solution, and tell exactly when it turned from pink to blue. I’m colour blind and I couldn’t see when it turned from pink to blue. This was in 1955, I guess.;79;Family/Home Environment
But you had tried for Cornell already at that time?;Robert C. Richardson: No, it was just that was one of the ones I looked at. I looked at Harvard and Princeton and Stanford and all those fancy places. At Duke university they had this program in low temperature physics and low temperatures had a lot of appeal for me because it seemed like … It’s like explorers. If you’re one of the first explorers to go to Antarctica, you can have a mountain named after you maybe, and that was going to very low temperatures, that sort of opportunity. They had a very famous theorist named Fritz London and a spectacular experimentalist named William Fairbank, so I would try to go there. I got a warm letter from a very nice man named Horst Meyer who said he would love to have me come work with him and I said, OK, that will be fun and I can see all these great people at Duke. When I got to Duke after I was out of the army I discovered that Fitz London had been dead for five years and Bill Fairbank, the famous experimentalist, had gone to Stanford. But I went to work with Horst Meyer and we became great friends and started a thesis project that made the prediction about this nuclear magnetic phase transition in helium-3 at low temperatures. That was that, that led Dave Lee to come see me and say, Hey, why don’t you come with me and work with me at Cornell and we’ll see if we can do that work?’ Then that led to the work super fluid helium-3, so I had a lot of happy accidents. But if you had ever asked me even when I was in college, Are you going to spend your life as a professor doing research in a very specialised field? I would have said, No, you’re crazy that’s not what I want to do.;79;Creativity
What made you stay on as a teacher?;Robert C. Richardson: Because it was fun. I enjoyed working with the students and had summer programs for high school students and I discovered I was more of a ham actor than I thought. I loved to give these big luxury demonstration courses and make things go pop and sparks and tell corny jokes of the kind of professors tell. The students would politely laugh and maybe even remember them in the future. The whole purpose of the luxury demonstration course is to persuade to seduce the students into thinking that there is something there that might be worth understanding and pursue a little bit further.;79;Mentors (Role models)
It sounds like you chose exactly what you wanted, but yet if you had gone into industry, it might have been more money for you personally, it might have been more money for research, applied research, but you stayed on. Has it been difficult to get money to do research, more basic research at the university? How have you worked on that field?;Robert C. Richardson: The people that especially follow the small group research path have increasingly had to scramble and the competition for the most open-ended research with say the National Science Foundation is very stiff, but roughly only one person in three that writes the proposal gets funded. I think that young people starting up right now have a harder time than I did at the beginning. But generally people say, OK, I have to write three proposals to get one funded, that’s what I’ll do.;79;Environment
Do you encourage them as well to do that if they come and ask your advice?;Robert C. Richardson: We give a lot of advice in mentoring young people. One good trend is a lot more of multi-party, multi-disciplinary research. We have groups of people who get together and think about research in a given topic area and get together and figure out how they can make contributions to the whole and a pattern of research. That’s great fun.;79;Advice for young researchers
That’s great that it’s done so well, and I am sure it was also good for the publishing of the book that you were a Nobel Laureate. Am I wrong? Does it come with certain obligations, expectations to have won the prize?;Robert C. Richardson: Now there is another piece of it too, that I have worked in a very successful graduate school. At almost every major university in the United States there is a former student, maybe not of me but of somebody close to me, that knew me and interacted with me and would be willing to actually ‘Hey, the Richardsons were involved in this book’ and would take a look at it and give a hearing, so that helped too.;79;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Does it come with obligations to have won the prize, to have the prize?;Robert C. Richardson: Some people think so and some not, but I felt I did. I mean I was 59 when I won the prize and I felt that the system, the country, a science report and my university had given me a lot and I’d had a very happy and successful career. I’ve tried to return that now and have participated and I accepted an administrative job at Cornell. I’m the senior research officer at Cornell and I’ve been on a number of panels and boards and science policy groups in the time since then.;79;The impact of nobel on you
"To round up this interview I just would like to ask a more personal question. I have read that you are a great fan of the outdoor activities. You were a scout; you like to watch birds. Can you tell us a little bit about that?";"Robert C. Richardson: I guess that was the closest part of being involved in science. I was a boy scout and I came along when you had to be 12 to be a boy scout and I became an eagle scout, the highest rank in the minimum time; appointed great pride to my mother who encouraged me. She encouraged me a lot of things. I took piano lessons from the age of six until I graduated from high school. I was not a great pianist, but I enjoyed it. Three summers that I was in high school I had summer jobs in a boy scout camp on the Chesapeake Bay, Camp Roosevelt. I was a nature counsellor and I loved it. My job was to take kids on bird hikes and that part of Maryland on the Chesapeake Bay has a lot of marshes and we’d go on canoe trips and be in the marshes at sunrise in the morning to be able to see the birds. I learned where the birds would be and they became like friends. I learned the birds by their songs and I would point to the top of an oak tree there and I’d say, Do you see that, that’s a red eyed vireo and you can tell the difference between the red eyed and the white eyed vireo. We had binoculars, but you couldn’t see the difference, they have a different colour ring around it. I would then imitate the song and we saw wonderful things. There’s a very famous painting by Audubon, the great naturalist in America, of an osprey, that’s a fish hawk holding a fish between his claws, or just dropping one and an American eagle swooping down on him. One of the tricks that the eagle had to get food was he’d wait for the osprey to catch a fish and then he would swoop down from above and catch it. We saw that.";79;Career Development
Is it important to you to be able to combine the two, your love for the nature and your obvious interest in the research and finding out more about what we are doing here on this earth?;Robert C. Richardson: Yes, that’s true. There’s that, that’s part of life and how it fits. If I had come along maybe four or five years later after it was clear what the discovery Watson and Crick had made in DNA, I might have decided to go into biology, but from my point of view at the time I was going to college, biology seemed more like a library science, cataloguing this and that and the other whereas the physical sciences had more clearly defined steps one could take in both research and in the applications.;79;Future research
Just to round off, any advice to young students. Out in the nature and back in to the laboratory very quickly to do the research. What shall they do?;Robert C. Richardson: My advice for young children and parents is to encourage them to be very broad and to have enough of their training in the key courses like mathematics at an early age, so that the options aren’t cut off. A central thing in flexibility and career is learning mathematics and pursuing that and recognising that it’s not just being able to fill out your tax forms and income statements and so forth. A key path in creativity is understanding mathematics and having mathematical training at an early age. Then after that, my recommendation is to find something you like and pursue it with all your heart and have the guts to change when you change your mind.;79;Advice for young researchers
Professor Georges Charpak, welcome to Stockholm and to this Nobel interview. You are one of the very few French scientists who have been awarded a Nobel Prize. Why is that so?;Georges Charpak: I know a lot of very good scientists in France and I don’t know the rules of the games, since it was a good surprise to have the Nobel Prize. And it so happened because what I did was important for the activity of other physicists who had had the Nobel Prize using the instruments they had made, but I don’t feel it is the most important thing I have done.;86;Environment
What is the most important thing you have done?;Georges Charpak: I’ve worked on many detectors, some were very elegant and useless, and didn’t have a Nobel Prize, so this one was not the most elegant, but it was useful.;86;Research
You have also written a biography, My Name is Grisha. Where does this name come from?;Georges Charpak: I am born in Ukraine, it is now Ukraine, it was on the border. So I had a very agitated life at the beginning of my life, because I was born in a place where there had been ten years of ethnic fights and revolutionary fights.;86;Personal Characteristics
So how come you got interested in science?;Georges Charpak: I was not interested in science. I was interested in everything. I was reading Jules Verne, Alexander Dumas, even Lenin, I wanted to change the world. I was interested in the world. And France was a place where you have a kind of intellectual evolution between the two halves. You had the fascism coming up, the anti-fascists fighting …;86;Motivation
Where were you during the war?;Georges Charpak: I spent one year in jail, in the south of France, and one year in Dachau, which is a concentration camp …;86;Life
Why do you want to continue? (working);"Norman F. Ramsey: Because it’s very interesting. I want to know the answers. We’re trying to make various investigations. We’re studying symmetry of the neutron and looking for an electric dipole moment to the extent to which it may or may not be shaped like an American football or like a sphere. And it’s a very interesting thing; I want to know. And we in theory have been sort of competing on those theories of whether there should be one there, or shouldn’t be one there. Now we’re convinced that there should be one there, but we haven’t seen it yet. But that’s a puzzle for them.";91;Creativity
That’s fantastic. The people you’re working with, are they former students of yours?;Norman F. Ramsey: Yes, some are former students. I’ve been working particularly with a somewhat international group at Grenoble, France. I would say Michael Pendlebury is one of the principle and Philip Harris and some of the people from Grenoble. I started the experiments with graduate students.;91;Creativity
Is it that you pick up some information?;Norman F. Ramsey: That’s right. I mean the very first experiment I did and that was looking disparity, which is symmetry, whether nature would know the difference between left and right handed. And everybody said ‘It won’t know the difference’. But I said ‘Well, it’s still worth doing a test’. We didn’t find it, but it turns out there was a failure of parity. That’s a good test to do.;91;Creativity
What was it in your childhood maybe that made you want to become a scientist?;Norman F. Ramsey: I don’t know. I mean at the time I was a child I didn’t know too much about science is a thing you, a career you go in to, but on the other hand one of my favourite magazines was Popular Mechanics. And I used to make up some of the things that they did there and read with interest what was then the frontier of science as it was then reported. And it fascinated me, but at the time I was in college, even physics wasn’t really recognised as a subject, so it was only after I graduated from college that I shifted to physics actually as opposed … well for a while I was in mathematics, which I enjoyed very much. But it was always, my basic interest was always there. I mean physical things have always interested me. I was curious and still am.;91;Motivation
What do you think when you were rewarded the Nobel Prize, 1989, had you expected it?;Norman F. Ramsey: No I had not. Almost every year a group of us would wonder not whether I’m going to get the prize, but whether who’s going to get the prize. But that particular year 1989 my wife and I had been on a mountain trip in the Himalayas. We took a trip from Kashmir to Ladakh passing over a couple of passes at 17,000 feet high, which was higher than any mountain I’d been On, much less any pass, and it was a fascinating trip. We didn’t speculate about the prize from here. I got back home and even then I had a little bit of learning about it because we’d been away the previous year actually visiting a professor. And we kept the telephone, but it was turned out this company only kept the telephone in my wife’s name not my name. So the chairman of the committee couldn’t find me.;91;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How long a time did it take?;Norman F. Ramsey: They released it to the newspapers at seven and the New York Times science editor found me immediately. I mean he knew where I was. But I learned later that they had even made a mistake. They had guessed maybe I might be in Washington DC. There was a Norman Ramsey there. And the chairman of the committee called him and called that number and asked if the young man who answered it his father was there. And he said ‘Yes he is’. ‘Well we’d like to speak to him’. He said ‘But well my father’s sound asleep. It’s now six a.m.’ and they said ‘We want to tell him he’s received half the Nobel Prize in Physics’. And this young man said ‘That’s very interesting since my father’s an economist’.;91;Free time
So what was the feeling then when you got it? Were you really happy?;Norman F. Ramsey: I was delighted. My first reaction even after I got the call from the New York Times, my first questioning was, he told me ‘What do you think about getting half the Nobel Prize in Physics’. I said ‘That’s wonderful, but are you sure?’ But then he named the other people who were getting it that year and they were very good. I was delighted to be in their company and that made it sound as if it was a real thing.;91;Impact of the Nobel on you
Could you tell us a little bit about you know what is has been and what you see in the future?;"Norman F. Ramsey: It has had really many, many more than I would have expected at the time I was doing the work, which was work on magnetic resonance. Magnetic resonance was a brand new thing before even I did the work because before I received the prize I was working with I I Rabi at Columbia. And had the very good luck of starting to work with him about two months before he invented the magnetic resonance method, which was a new thing. Immediately I and several others started working on it and the first experiments worked. Then the second experiment didn’t really seem to work right and you know you’re always disappointed when it doesn’t work right. But usually that’s more exciting because then it means there’s something different we found. Yes we were also looking to interactions in molecules, which was not what we were looking for originally. And so in addition to measuring the magnetic moment of the nucleus, we were also measuring the interactions that was in the molecules. So the chemists were almost immediately very interested in it.
And since then it has steadily expanded other things, part of which I have been involved in and part of which other people have been involved in. I mean one of the ones that turned out, because of the interaction in the molecule, particularly in the case of Adams, it’s a very sort of constant of nature. And it’s determined by quantum mechanics; it’s a very interesting thing. Quantum mechanics has things are fixed. You can be sure what they are. So quantum mechanically you could be sure that this constant would stay fixed, for that mean measuring that is a very good basis for atomic clocks because you need for that, and it’s really even different in principle for more previous clocks. I mean previous clocks like pendulum clocks; it depends on the mechanic who makes the pendulum. Does he make it the right length?
And in the case of atomic clocks, it’s nature who makes the device that determines the time, so that it’s universally you can be sure, unless we make a terrible mistake. If we make an atomic clock in the United States and someone makes it in England, it better be the same within our experimental area. And then we’ve steadily improved it. So that turned out, it makes that time determine that way rather more fun in the middle you know. And secondly it also is true that you could measure it much more accurately. So it’s both happy circumstance that the most accurate measurement, so that for example the second, the unitive time of the second is now determined, is defined in terms of oscillation and a caesium atom, which we were concerned with at one time.
I think it’s a rapidly moving field now. It looks as there will be even better definitions of a second. That atom was accurate to about what we call one part in 10 to the 15th. That’s one part in one followed by 15 zeros. So it’s very accurate. But there are things for which you need even greater accuracy. It’s the best test of the theory of relativity are now done with atomic clocks. And you can make extreme tests for that. Radio astronomy is now a very powerful tool, but to make the telescopes have good resolution, you want one to be in one side of the earth and the other on the other side of the earth. But you have to have good clocks to match the two. So there are many, many applications for it.";91;Life
GPS is another area?;Norman F. Ramsey: GPS, everybody who buys for $100 a GPS receiver doesn’t actually get an atomic clock. He gets a good crystal clock. But the satellites which are going around which give the signals that he synchronises to, those are atomic clocks. And then particularly the central stations, which keep the time for the whole system, are atomic clocks.;91;Research
Maybe that’s one of, as you said, you know the reason you’re still so curious, is that what you need to have, the curiosity?;Norman F. Ramsey: That’s right. You need to be very curious and willing to work hard, but also think freshly I mean.;91;Creativity
What are you doing then if something doesn’t work?;"Norman F. Ramsey: That’s one of the things I talked about. I think all of us who do scientific research, almost all of us have our successes and our failures. And the key difference between the people I think who on the whole succeed and the others is what happens after you’ve had one of your failures? I mean you think you have a good thing, an important thing to look for and well it can’t be there; it isn’t there, you can’t find it. It’s a disappointment. Or somebody else does the experiment first, that’s a sad thing too. But the people who are really good in the field, say ‘Fine, I guess we lost that one. We’ll try something different we hope that’s even better’.";91;Creativity
So the scope for doing new beautiful discoveries are still out there obviously?;Norman F. Ramsey: They’re still out there. They will be different in nature. I mean yes, no one will ever discover again that at least in the energy levels we’re doing with if the electrons circulate around a nucleus or something like that. That was done by our people, but how it does it? For example, when I decided to do experiments of Rutherford and others who found that was the motion. It wasn’t quantise. Now we know that you have to do with quantum mechanics. It’s probably different mechanics in fact and that’s developed in more recent years. And we have the interesting time I think in physics now that in some respects we can account for an amazing amount of material. I mean our ordinary universe that we see at normal energies, at normal accuracies, we really understand quite thoroughly. And it requires quantum mechanics to do this, but it works.;91;Future Research
That’s fascinating. My last question would be, do you believe that scientists have any special responsibility, particularly scientists who have received a Nobel Prize, for bringing messages of importance to politicians and decision makers?;Norman F. Ramsey: I think they do and I agree with you that probably specially Nobel Prize, a number of us do that. Unfortunately, sometimes they are not so responsive and I am afraid at the present moment our government is not as responsive as it was a few years ago, but I hope that will change. But I still think it’s still important to do. This is true for example the things on the environment. I mean it’s very clear that the atmosphere is heating up and that at least a significant factor of that is due to people. The problem of CO2 in the atmosphere is important, but some of the officials in our government don’t recognise it. So even though they have scientific committees that call this to attention and say it is something we should do, and somehow they sort of get some other advisers. The trouble is you can always hire somebody who can give you advice in a different direction if you want. And then they tend to modify their reports in that direction. So there are real problems in that regard. But the answer is yes, we should and I have. I mean actually in my case I also felt very strongly about not getting involved in the Iraq war, but that didn’t affect the government’s position.;91;Roles of Science
Professor Leon Lederman, welcome to Stockholm and to this Nobel interview. You have won the Nobel Prize in 1988 and this was for your research in elementary particle physics and the last century was really a very exciting time in physics and some people maybe say that all the major discoveries in physics, they are there. Do you think so?;Leon M. Lederman: I don’t know. There’s certainly some discoveries that still have to be done, in other words there are some things we don’t understand and we don’t know how profound these are. You know, 100 years ago, there was also a feeling that all the discoveries were done, but there were some funny things and the question was are these minor problems that will be solved by the powerful knowledge that came from Uten and Maxwell, from the 1600s right through the end of 1900s, I mean, well, the end of the 1800s. Was all of that knowledge powerful knowledge enough and so that the small things that we didn’t understand would be fixed? And many people thought they would be fixed. Instead, they were indications of the major revolution.;94;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How deep is the ocean?;Leon M. Lederman: We should hasten to say that, whereas the field I’m talking about, which is sort of cosmology and particle physics, that field is different from the rest of physics because the rest of physics, the physics of complexity, that will go on forever, there’s no question about that because there’s essentially an infinite amount of complexity, I believe, and these days some of that is called biology which of course between us is a branch of physics nowadays because it’s based on molecules.;94;Future Research
Yes. You wrote the popular science book called “The God Particle”. What do you think is the connection between the particle and the God?;Leon M. Lederman: Well, the God particle, the name was given by a publisher who wanted to make a lot of money and I must admit I was sympathetic to his desire, so the name was really when I was writing the book, it was called the Higgs particle. At the end, the commercial interest said no-one ever heard of Higgs but everyone has heard of God so we’ll call it the god particle but the god in my book is not a theological god, it’s more of a philosophical god, it’s really a metaphor for nature. Nature is very puzzling, nature has to be understood and Einstein often made that connection, he called it in German “der Alter”, the old man, you know, how did he and I prefer she in my book, as a she and I thought if it would be ever made into a movie then Margaret Thatcher could play God, that would be a perfect role.;94;Roles of Science
You’re working a lot with the science and public and with public education in science. Is it since you have been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Leon M. Lederman: Well, let’s see, when did I start? Well, you know, in the US we invented the best job in Western civilisation, which is being a professor at a university because you do research and you teach, if you insist, and teaching was always something I liked to do, so I was always a teacher as well as a researcher.;94;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Why do you think it is so? Why is science so important?;Leon M. Lederman: Because science is changing our lives. The engine for change comes out of science and technology, so today it’s cell phones and computers and laptops and internet and in 10 years, you can think of something, an equivalent set of words which will change the way we live. Science changes the way we live, it has huge economic consequences. You may know that in developing countries, a 5th grade education – which includes science – is the best contraceptive ever invented and since population’s a major human problem, science influences that, so science is the driving influence for change and today, we’re very aware that there is a battle, if you like, or some people like to call it a war between civilisation and rigid belief systems, fundamentalism which does not allow for any diversity of opinions on how the world works and so science is in conflict and I think that’s a conflict we cannot avoid and that conflict takes place in the schools of the world.;94;Motivation
So you don’t think that the schools, for example the schools in the US, do the right job?;"Leon M. Lederman: Oh, they’re doing a terrible job in my opinion because the US, you know, there are experts that measure science understanding and I think the US is not much worse than France or maybe Sweden. I think most countries do not educate non-scientists properly so that they feel comfortable with science. The teachers have that problem because teachers themselves especially teachers of young children, primary school teachers, are totally ignorant about how to teach science and what science is; how to teach mathematics and what mathematics is. And that’s terrible because children are born scientists, right? They do everything that scientists do. They test how strong things are, they measure the falling bodies, they’re balancing themselves, they’re doing all kinds of things to learn the physics of the world around them, so they’re all perfect scientists. They ask questions, they drive parents crazy with why, why, why. And then somehow they go into school and the school system crushes their curiosity and converts them to timidity and to the same fear of science that the teachers have.";94;Environment
Do you see that part of this is a result of how science works or how scientists are working?;"Leon M. Lederman: Well, science itself is the acquisition of knowledge, so you can’t blame science because you would be saying I don’t want to know. Science says here are how things work. Technology is the application of science in society and that’s in the hands of not the scientists but more of the politicians, the citizens and their leaders, and in democratic society elected officials who have to make decisions because not everything we know how to do, we should do.
There may be things we don’t want to do because they have bad effects and we’ve learned a lot about the problems of pollution and environmental contamination and we’re now much wiser about this and the US in its occasional wisdom developed something called the Office of Technology Assessment, which was an office to look at technologies and to warn us that some technologies may not be beneficial. But then another Congress came and said we don’t need such advice and so wisdom is not always part of political life.";94;Creativity
But you have been fighting the science illiteracy for many years now. Do you have any results of your work?;"Leon M. Lederman: Of course. But I don’t know how to measure them because I think it’s a long term thing. You know, first you should start in the schools, that’s a long term right, because it takes 20 years before the child who begins in school can make use of the knowledge that you give them, but you have to start early and we learn from the experts on children’s minds and brains and cognition science. We’ve learned that it’s very important to begin training of mathematics and science very early so that’s where you’ll begin, but then you have to continue through the entire education always bringing in the importance of science, so that if the student is going to be a lawyer or a business man or journalist or whatever they’re going to be, these days they have to have a basic understanding of how science works and a comfort level with science so that if there’s something new that happens and they don’t know it, they can find out. They learn how to go to internet and get information or they can go to their library, now they call them information centres, and find out.
That’s the basic training we need, is that people have to be comfortable with new ideas and new possibilities and that applies to future politicians. I mean, it’s just a chilling thought that politicians with so much power don’t understand science at all and they have to reach out to somebody near them, hopefully, who has more of an understanding. That can work if they can choose wisely among their advisors but I think there’s no substitute for some basic, just as there’s no substitute for understanding a language, you know. You need the grammar and the vocabulary before you can enjoy Shakespeare or do things that require that. It’s the same thing with the scientific knowledge.
And then, of course, you don’t want to neglect the people that are already out of school and so you need to use television and cinema, radio, museums, are extremely important, all of these channels for informal education. So we need programmes which don’t glamorise athletes and movie stars but maybe do something about scientists, you know. We need a programme which tells people how scientists work and what they do and what science can do and what science can’t do .";94;Motivation
Heinrich Rohrer, welcome to Stockholm and to this interview with Nobelprize.org. You were awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Ernst Ruska and Gerd Binnig for your joint work in developing microscopy. And in particular you and Gerd Binnig received the prize for your design of the scanning tunnelling microscope. Now this is a device that enables us to look at the surface of objects at the atomic scale, by means of a probe which skims over the surface and records variations in the topography below it with minute current fluctuations. What did this device enable us to see for the first time that we hadn’t seen before?;Heinrich Rohrer: As you say surface structures in a different way. I mean you had some ideas about certain surface structures, but you never saw it in, so to speak, in real space. So it’s just like if you would trace a surface with your finger, you see. So you see it in real space and then of course … actually you see the electrons on the surface. It’s electronic wave functions and so you also can see certain properties. You can test the hardness of a surface.;101;Meaning(Values) of Work
Right. And in those early days of using it, what were the first surprises that came up? Because as you said, you sort of had an idea and then you could actually see. What surprises turned up?;Heinrich Rohrer: I think the first surprise was that we really could do it with atomic resolution, you see. Actually that you can do it with atomic resolution that’s inherent in the approach we took. But we didn’t expect it that it could make such fine fingers. But then every point of a needle ends up with one atom. And this very atom at the end that’s then your finger, you see, and that’s this atom, it has the size of an atom and so you can feel other atoms. And that was a pleasant surprise that you could do it relatively easy.;101;Research
On the subject of being able to do it, it seems unimaginably complex to make such a thing because you are talking about atoms almost in contact with other atoms, there must be no vibration. You are talking about a probe which is, as you say, one atom thick at its tip. The mind boggles. How did you have the confidence to even imagine that one could do such a thing, to make such an instrument?;"Heinrich Rohrer: Let’s say we didn’t see any obstacle which could not be overcome. And of course there were quite a few fortuitous developments in the whole thing, but somehow luck was on our side. But I think in science you need luck, you see. And if you don’t have the luck in a specific case, then you do something different. You might have luck in something else. So, you see it was less difficult finally than everybody thought. That’s why everybody thought you could not do it and that’s why nobody did it.
And that’s, I would say, a crucial thing in science. You see, everything is new because other people think you cannot do it, or because other people do not appreciate that it could become important. And we live of novelty in science, so whenever you do something new, you have to overcome certain beliefs that this cannot be done, that it is not interesting and so on.";101;Creativity
Oh really? So the physicists are treated a little bit differently there?;Heinrich Rohrer: Yes, you see people who work on technology, I think that’s usually a joint effort of many people whereas the physics are … we did this type of physics where everybody could do his own project on his own, maybe with some help of a technician or of a post doc or of a PHD student. Whereas in technology you have to make concentrated efforts towards something and there of course a certain freedom gets lost. You still, even in technology you have the freedom to solve a problem your way, you see. But it naturally sits in a certain framework whereas in the physics everybody had to come up with his own idea what he was going to do.;101;Motivation
And you changed field a few times along the way? How did you make the decisions about which fields to pursue? Was that IBM directed or were they just your?;"Heinrich Rohrer: No, that’s all the research of member are responsible for their own field and finding their own topics, you see. They are their own, how do you say?
Masters.
Heinrich Rohrer: They have to make their own work you see. So I was working on a set of problems before and I thought somehow I came as far as I could go without learning completely new things; that’s in critical phenomena. And that was a very interesting topic and it was more or less at the top of the interest. And so by making everything smaller, inhomogenities plays a more important role.
So if you have an oxide which has a few holes then the conduction of electricity through this oxide is maybe a little bit larger. Now if you have 100 holes, then you have the same type if you make another batch of oxide, you might have 98 holes. And then maybe the conductivity will be different simply by two percent. So the fluctuation from piece to piece is still small. But if you make things smaller and smaller then you might have batches where you just have two or three holes, you see. Now maybe this one has two holes and this one has three holes and this one has one hole, so then the holes effect a conductivity most, so then in one case you would have a tremendous conductivity and in the other case you would have a conductivity which is two times less or something like that. And that is how the fluctuations from piece to piece which cannot be tolerated in miniaturisation. And so that’s an idea to work along these lines and nobody did it really in IBM and it was an important problem. Now in this case it was inhomogeneity of /- – -/ oxide, but you can have many different ways where inhomogeneities play an important role and the smaller something becomes the more the role of the inhomogeneity can get the disasters you see.";101;Career Devleopment
Right, well I want to return to the theme of miniaturisation in general a little later, but thinking about the decades at the IBM research labs where you moved through various fields and changed. Do you think that as well as being, wanting to move on because you had reached the pinnacle of success in a particular field, there was also an element of feeling that as a newcomer, but an experienced newcomer to another field, you could make a significant contribution fast?;Heinrich Rohrer: I think that’s generally true and unfortunately we do not practise that. You see, if you look at Nobel Prize work, that’s very often done at a young age.;101;Career Devleopment
Did you recognise it immediately? Was it apparent from the beginning that it was just the perfect partnership?;Heinrich Rohrer: No, because I think he recognised it earlier than me, but you see I’m older so I’m a little bit more maybe conservative in many respects.  But I think it simply worked out. And that was the first team really in physics to my knowledge. That was the first time two guys got together and did something.;101;Creativity
And in 1986, basically the technique had been proved and very rapidly you were awarded the Nobel Prize on the back of lots of other prizes as well. Did that change everything very radically for you, or did life continue just pretty much the same?;Heinrich Rohrer: I think the recognition we got already before, I mean let’s say the recognition in the scientific community, the esteem, then of course a Nobel Prize, that’s maybe a discontinuity in the whole thing … but surely changed a few things. I mean ok, you are then a Nobel Laureate and that’s already a bit different, how do you say?;101;Impact of Nobel prize on you
And STM was one of the sort of building blocks of what I suppose one might call the nanoscience revolution. It opened up a whole new area to view and I’d like to ask you a little bit about the word I used there, revolution, because nanoscience is seen as a revolution. Is that a correct term? Is it changing the way we look at the world?;"Heinrich Rohrer: I think the revolution has to have a little bit more than just to scale. It’s true that it was getting to a smaller and smaller scale, that was always the beginning of a revolution. I mean, from exploring the world since Columbus you see, that was the world scale and then came the industrial revolution that was the micro scale to let’s say down to the micrometre as a precision scale. And then came the IT revolution, the information technology revolution and that was in the scale of micrometre. But you see it wasn’t the micro revolution. It was really the information technology revolution. And the other one was the industrial revolution. So I would hate to say the nanorevolution. It has to have a little bit more substance. I have my expectations what could happen, but I don’t have a word for it, you see.
So now for nano just getting smaller alone does not make the revolution. I mean also for the microtechnology you had to have a transistor which really changed in the way you could do things.  And I think also on the nanotechnology you have to have a few more ideas, the way you will approach new things. We know a little bit what could be the end of it, but how to do it we don’t know yet.";101;Meaning(Values) of Work
Is one point that having reached the nano scale, the atomic scale, we’ve really reached the limits of miniaturisation? We can’t really go smaller.;Heinrich Rohrer: I would guess so. Yes. And so that’s I think you hit the point, you see. And we are already very close. We have covered of the miniaturisation over the last 50 years. We have covered two thirds, or three quarters. And there is just a little bit to go, the difficult bit to the nano. So just getting smaller is not all. You see I think nano has to offer a little bit different things such as being smaller in order to become a revolution. And I think nano offers really completely new prospects in many ways.;101;Future Research
That’s a nice drawing to a close of things. I’d just like to ask one last question which is based around the idea of moving fields. Obviously, you’ve been successful in moving from field to field. What do you think, is it possible to answer, nanoscience would require now in terms of an influx of new people? Are there people who you would like to see move into the field of studying properties at the atomic level?;"Heinrich Rohrer: The young people and I think they do it.
Heinrich Rohrer: That was a meeting. You see, that was also an interesting aspect when we started with the whole thing when the STM came out, you see it was mainly young people. There weren’t many established ones you see. The surfer scientist, the established surfer scientist, they stayed surfer scientists. They didn’t go into the STM, only later. But now it’s quite interesting to see when you go to a meeting. I was at the last meeting, a big meeting that was the conference in Basel in 2005 and I was very pleasantly surprised by the young people, you see. There were so many young people, young guys with their enthusiasm and in particular a lot of young women, who get involved in nanoscience and not just in the biological place, biological area, they get involved in real hard let’s say mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering in context with nanoscience. I think that for me is a very encouraging sign when also young women get really enthusiastic about something. I think it’s in good hands.";101;Career Devleopment
Welcome, very nice to see you, professor Klitzing. It was back in 1985 you received the Nobel Prize. I just would like to start off by asking you how did you go about it, when you had this hypothesis and you wanted to prove it? How long time did it take and how did you go about it?;Klaus von Klitzing: Ok, then we have to really to go back how I selected physics to study and how did I go into the semi-conductor physics. At the time when I started at university in 1962, semi-conductor physics, lasers, just very modern topics, and I decided into go into this modern area. I was fascinated by the scientific topic and I studied in Braunschweig and you should know that Braunschweig, there is a National Bureau of Standards in Germany, the metrology institute, called Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt and as a young student, I always worked between the terms at this Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt. This was very important also for my discovery because I identified that it is very important for this Institute for metrology because my discovery has something to do with fundamental constant, these very precise measurements. I was already sensitive as a young student with these questions. Then I have done research and then you are doing the diploma work, in Germany the PhD and then the habitation, if you want to go into the professor direction, but then I suddenly discovered, ok, do we have enough positions at universities to find a job? There were no positions and then I tried to get jobs in the industry and they said oh no, you are over educated, you will be unhappy in industry. Fortunately there was this so called Heisenberg programme that a scientist had the possibility to do what he wants to do, can select the institute, the research centre, he will get every month his salary and then he has to give some lectures but he is absolutely free to do research and I decided to go to the best laboratories to do my experiments. I was working the semi-conductors and have used high magnetic fields and there was one centre in Grenoble in France and I decided to go to this laboratory and to continue my research.;102;Impact of the Nobel on you
But you knew then already what you wanted to study? You had this idea?;Klaus von Klitzing: Yes, I had always semi-conductor physics, I wanted to understand modern micro electronics, how can I improve devices. I had contacts also in the industry but from the fundamental physics, I wanted to know how can I make faster switches, how can the electron move in the semi-conductors. It was really more or less by accident that I went into this direction because during my research I discovered if I clean a sample, that change the properties, so if you clean the surface, the electrical behaviour was different. Then you see, ok, the surface is very important and then I focused on the very thin layer of the surface and this is connected to modern micro electronics. All electronic properties are in a very, very thin layer and in this way, I went in a direction where I never expected that I would discover something fundamental. I was just interested to understand how I can improve something, how can I understand something and I had experience for about 10 years in this field. I collected a lot of information in my head and anyone who reads literature had the chance to discover the quantized Hall effect for which I got the Nobel Prize, because it was published, the data, but if you have not the experience. I worked with different companies, Siemens company in Germany, /- – -/ company in England and I saw that if I used different samples, I saw the same phenomena. Then I concluded, ok, there’s something fundamental in the pen of the source of the material and then I can fix it really. In the night of 5th of February at two o’clock in the morning, I decided to look at some special feature which I have seen for many, many years and then I developed a very simple theory which was so simple that couldn’t believe that this is working. It was too simple because in a semi-conductor you have impurities, you have dirty effects and it’s very complicated normally. I used low approximation to understand or to analyse something and I found that the very simple equation works, that there are no corrections, no deviations, so within five minutes I knew there is something interesting. This was not the main road, this was just one type of experiment which was used to characterise our system.;102;Motivation
What did it mean to you professionally, that you got the prize a few years later? You were quite a young man still, at that age, one of the youngest to receive a prize.;Klaus von Klitzing: This is a problem. A lot of scientists told me, oh be careful, this is danger if you get this prize because the Nobel Prize really is the highest prize you will get in science and it can go down only or you can keep the level. I decided now I have this position to generate an atmosphere for young students to develop, to have creativity. Immediately I decided you cannot go still up to a higher level so just transfer it to the young students because I could develop because my professor gave me the freedom and always supported me. I never worried about my future because I knew as long as I’m doing good research, somebody will help me. I will have this atmosphere also for my students, so this was my decision.;102;Impact of Nobel prize on you
So, it’s important to have the funding to do the basic researches. Is that something that you are convinced of?;Klaus von Klitzing: Yes, this is very important because there’s obviously discussion about basic research and at the Max Planck Society we have not a problem because Max Planck Society, they favour basic research and the most important thing is that you have some new knowledge that just developed during your research. Only the very first one is a success. You have never second prize or third prize in basic research. You should be at the very front and you should work for 100% as a scientist, so there is no compromise between science and then some other things, you have to work 120%.;102;Environment
Max Planck Institute is mainly funded by the German state. You have already said you think it’s very important that independent research institutes are there. How do you see the development in the future for scientific research in Europe specifically or maybe even directly in Germany?;Klaus von Klitzing: I think the Max Planck Society is internationally known for excellent science and is accepted doing good science and if I’m asked what’s the reason for this I always say the independence. We are financed by the government. In Germany half of the central government and half by the different states but they have no direct influence on the research in the institute, so we decide, we select our directors and highest quality is always the most important thing. As a Max Planck director, I’m absolutely free to select my topic, so I can do brain research if I believe that I can contribute to this. We have some variation every six years, compare them between different Max Planck Institutes and so on but to give them the freedom is very important but you need money and the politicians always try to get some influence on the scientific topics in the institute. Even at present we are fighting against this influence. They will say ok, perhaps for political reason you have to select more female directors or something. If the quality is there, there is no problem but for outside to have some special boundary conditions, it becomes difficult so if you have to co-operate with industry or with universities, we will do this. It’s there on the same level. For both sides, we have some profit out of this but if somebody says, ok now because universities should be supported with basic research, you should combine Max Planck Institute with universities. If we decide this is ok, we’ll do it, but to have decision from outside, this will be always dangerous and we are trying to avoid this. You spoke about Europe – I’m trying to generate also in Europe some European research currency. There’s some discussion because basic research is not in the frameworks of the European programme, these programmes are for industry. There are a lot of boundary conditions, you need partners from different countries, you cannot optimise from the quality of your research, you have to optimise this by other parameters and I’m trying to generate something like Max Planck Institute, on the European level, to have something where the highest quality is the first criteria for supporting some research and I hope that in next years we will generate a European research council where only the quality of research counts.;102;Environment
I would like to ask you a more personal question. In which way did the prize affect your personal life and your family’s life? Was it to good or bad? Did it put much more pressure on you maybe, work wise?;"Klaus von Klitzing: There are different influences. First of all my children or my wife, they don’t believe what’s in the newspaper they can read because they have the experience that the newspaper … Because I decided the family is one side and my business is the other side and I didn’t want to have my family included in all the discussions. Then the press generates some information which are not true, this was very bad side effect. It’s also some education, that you should not believe everything what is printed, you have to read different source to get the true information. Now for me, I decided to behave in the same way as before. Even today, I never accept some invitation where only the fact that I’m a Nobel Prize winner is the reason that I’m invited for some exhibition or something like that or after dinner speech also; even if they give money, I decide no. If this is the reason, I will not accept this. I decided to be as normal as possible and therefore I like to have these discussions also with students, these Lindau meetings. The Nobel Prize winners and the students meet in order to demonstrate that even Nobel Prize winners are normal persons. I remember when I first time I saw a Nobel Prize winner at a distance of 20 metres as a student, there was something, a different person, and I never tried to contact him. I think I will encourage people that we are normal persons, we know something in special areas but we also don’t know everything because this is one of our problems, that a lot of people expect that we should know everything and that we should problems which we are not able to solve or everyone else is able to solve, this is the same way. In this way I can survive.";102;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I have read in your autobiography that you must have been a child with a great desire to learn new things. Your siblings had to drag you away from the books. Was it so? Were you …?;Nicolaas Bloembergen: That’s correct, but I liked to read and I always liked challenges. So in fact I chose to study physics because I found it the most difficult topic in my gymnasium, the Latin school I went to in Utrecht.;108;Family/Home Environment
And did that give you what you wanted, obviously, but how was it during your student’s year, did you feel it was a challenge?;Nicolaas Bloembergen: It’s still a challenge. I mean, it’s still a difficult topic, but I’m fascinated by the very curious correspondence between mathematics and physical phenomena, and that mathematics can describe so many phenomena with such accuracy. A professor Wigner, Eugene Wigner, a famous theoretician, he called that connection between mathematics and the real world uncanny.;108;Personal Characteristics
You talk very nicely about your parents in your autobiography as well, the way they were trying to keep you children in good health and so on. Would you describe a little bit about that?;Nicolaas Bloembergen: My father went by bicycle and a little cart to get potatoes to feed his family, and he travelled for 50 kilometres or more. And then he exchanged objects for food, and so they did a wonderful job keeping the family alive.;108;Life
Yes. When you look at what you have achieved with your work and the way the laser, and its various application, the way it’s used today, what makes you most proud?;Nicolaas Bloembergen: I’ve been lucky that the two topics that have interested me have both lead to very important applications. In the case of nuclear magnetic resonance, the thesis data, in my thesis, concerned what is called nuclear magnetic relaxation in liquids and also some solid materials, but most importantly we measured the relaxation time of protons in water and aqueous solutions, the influence of viscosity and temperature, and those data are now the basis in which MRI pictures can be taken, because the nuclear magnetic moments of protons which are water molecules, it’s about 70% of the body, water, they measure small differences in relaxation time between healthy cells and tumorous cells and whatnot. And in blood vessels. So we are, my data was really very basic, to an application I didn’t foresee, nor did my thesis supervisor, Purcell, in fact nobody had an idea that MRI would come even as late as 1960.;108;Impact of Nobel prize on you
On one of your lectures that I listened in to you also told us about other uses of the laser that I was not totally aware of. Would you just mention a few that might not be so known to the public in general?;"Nicolaas Bloembergen: As I said, the second item was going into optics and especially non-linear optics, which is the behaviour of light and propagation of light in media at very high light intensities. Those high intensities are only available from laser sources. So I was really interested in what one can do with lasers and I mentioned in my lecture that lasers are heavily used in surgery and in optical communications systems. Those are the two large scale applications that affect many people, everywhere in the world, because the optical fibre communications systems which, incidentally, use little lasers of … produced by [INAUDIBLE] inside the fibre, make the world very small, and we can now e-mail to anybody, anywhere in the world, we can dial up the worldwide web and all this information flows over large distances under the Pacific and Atlantic ocean, if necessary, to other points on the earth.
So those are the two big ones, and there are smaller and a little more trivial ones, like read out at supermarket checkout counters. You know, you have a code on each article, it’s read by a little laser and so even with the ambient light it doesn’t matter, the reflection on the code gives the information of what article and how much it cost. And the other, which seems rather trivial, but is very important, is to use laser beams which propagate straight lines over long distances. They are used to lay pipelines, including trivial things like sewer lines. I lived in a suburban neighbourhood and there were no sewers yet, and then in 1972 they laid out the sewer line with laser beams. That saves a lot of manpower, you need only one person with a mirror somewhere to do it. But of course, all the major oil pipelines and gas pipelines, they are all laid out by laser beams, and any big building that goes up, the verticals and horizontals are all checked with laser beams. So in the constructing industry it is a very widespread use, too.";108;Creativity
Did you think it would have such an impact?;Nicolaas Bloembergen: No. For several years, in the early 1960s, my colleague, Art Schawlow, with whom I shared the prize in 1981, he said the laser is a solution looking for a problem. He had a sense of humour. And that was really true, and all the applications really came gradually in the next decade.;108;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Have you had any thoughts about whether scientists have any responsibility …?;"Nicolaas Bloembergen: Certainly, but what do you do? You know, science itself is basically neutral, and then you get the problem, should I refuse to help to defend my country? So I was advising government committees on the use of laser beams in trying to shoot down intercontinental missiles. And soon thereafter we realised that it would be very difficult, and then 20 years later in 1981 President Reagan instituted the strategic defence initiative and the idea was to put lasers in the upper atmosphere and just beyond in space, and try to shoot down incoming missiles, supposedly, which might be fired by the Soviet Union. And then we wrote a report because everybody felt that that would not be feasible. Neither scientifically nor technologically.
But many people were afraid to express, well, they expressed their opinion, they weren’t afraid to express their opinion, but then they got the answer you haven’t studied the problem. So the American Physics Society said we’ll go and make a scientific study of the issues involved and then we’ll come out with a public report. But they selected 14 or 15 people and I and Kumar Patel were co-chairmen of that committee and the reason these people were chosen is because they had never gone very open in public of what their political opinions were. And we were not supposed to give any political opinion, just as scientific, purely scientific evaluation.";108;Role of Science
You have travelled wide and far and have had lots of contacts with universities all over the world and with other scientists all over the world. What has it given you, and why has it been important to you to be so global, so international?;Nicolaas Bloembergen: Well, a university like Harvard University attracts many foreign students and the brightest of them, and I find it interesting to see people from … you know, I myself was an immigrant, into the United States, and so I had many students from all parts of the world, and it’s nice to visit them later and see how they are doing in their respective careers. So we always enjoyed having an international community in the laboratory, involving Frenchmen, German, Norwegian, Italy, and people from the East, Japan, and especially China, different parts of China, some Taiwan, some Hong Kong, some mainland China, very interesting.;108;Environment
Is it important to work with young people, I mean, to keep one’s spirit, one’s creativity, do you enjoy that?;Nicolaas Bloembergen: Yes, I mean that is the only way not to go to sleep. During old age. No, that is very important to have this. That I think is the most important aspect of this meeting here in Lindau, that there are all these young people to interact with, too.;108;Creativity
Next year it will be the year of Einstein. What relationship do you have to him, and why is it important to highlight him, if you look in a broader sense to the public in general?;Nicolaas Bloembergen: It’s very important to take opportunities to involve the public with science and the centenary of Einstein papers is certainly a worthy excuse to focus attention on scientific efforts. But Einstein wrote a popular book, Einstein and Infeld, I forgot the title, I read it in German and it was originally written in German, and I was in high school, gymnasium and that fascinated me very much, and he explained in simple terms the ideas behind the relativity theory.;108;Creativity
Is it difficult in general do you think for the public at large to understand the need for scientific research?;Nicolaas Bloembergen: Weill it is, but you have to ask them what would you do without computers, without worldwide web, without, you know, cell phones, and so on. Or even without electricity, yeah? Let’s go back further. And it was all started by physicists.;108;Role of Science
Welcome to Stockholm, and to this Nobel interview, Professor Steven Weinberg. I have talked to some of your colleagues here, and everybody says that you’re the one to blame, or the one that brought light to the community of physicists when you wrote your book on cosmology in the early 1970s, called Gravitation and Cosmology. So how did you get interested in cosmology?;Steven Weinberg: I don’t really think there is anyone who isn’t interested in cosmology. If you go out and night and look at the stars it’s inevitable that you wonder what all this is. For me, it was a fantastic discovery when I was a young professor, just beginning, that there was a mathematical theory that could be applied to the whole universe. It had been worked out in the 1920s and the 1930s, and the theory of the whole universe was something I had to learn about, so I taught courses at Berkeley on the subject. Gradually I learned enough so that I wanted to put it all together in a book of my own, looking at things in my own way.;115;Life
How come you came into this field, into physics?;Steven Weinberg: It started with chemistry. When I was young I had a cousin who had been given a chemistry set. This is a toy, with chemicals, and test tubes that you play with, and he lost interest in it. He went into professional boxing. Perhaps he should have stayed in science, but anyway, the chemistry set came down to me, and I loved it, especially that beautiful wooden box that it came in. I loved playing with chemicals, and learned a little chemistry, of course. You always learn a little bit when you play with these things. I learned that all chemicals behave the way they do because of atoms, and then I wanted to learn about atoms. That was difficult because there was apparently a mysterious theory called quantum mechanics that had been developed in the 1920s. I read popular books by people like George Gamow and James Jeans, and I got very excited, not because I began to understand it, but because it seemed incomprehensible. And I thought if someone …;115;Motivation
You have also written a popular science book on cosmology called The First Three Minutes, which made cosmology maybe more comprehensible for the general public. This was more than 20 years ago. What has changed since then?;Steven Weinberg: The field has grown so much. I think this is a golden age now for cosmology. There are observations of not only that there is a radio background, this three degree radiation, but there are faint ripples in it that give evidence of conditions when the universe was a few hundred thousand years old, and our knowledge is getting more and more detailed. Also, there is now much more evidence about how the universe is expanding. It seems that the expansion at first was speeding up, then slowing down and now it’s beginning to speed up again. We have a theory inflation that describes what happened at the very earliest times, which we didn’t have when I wrote my text book, or when I wrote The First Three Minutes. It’s been a very exciting time for cosmology. Much more exciting in the last decade at any rate than in my own field of elementary particle physics.;115;Creativity
What would you regard as the most important observation or evidence for the big bang cosmology?;Steven Weinberg: Of course the expansion of the universe. We’ve had that evidence since 1930 or thereabouts. The fact that all the galaxies in the universe are rushing away from each other. This at times has been questioned as an interpretation of the observations, but I think it is more and more solid that the universe in this sense is expanding. Now we know much more about the rate of the expansion and how it’s speeding up and slowing down. That’s the most important evidence, but there is lots of other evidence. For example, the abundance of the elements. Most elements are produced in stars, and that doesn’t have so much to do with cosmology, but the lightest elements, about five or six isotopes of the lightest elements, were produced in the first three minutes and astrophysicists can calculate the abundance of these elements and compare it with what’s observed in the oldest stars. It agrees really marvellously well. That’s a real triumph, I think, of theoretical science.;115;Creativity
What do you consider the greatest contribution that you made to these theorists, or to science?;Steven Weinberg: It’s not in astrophysics or cosmology. I’ve written some papers in cosmology but they’re not of the first importance. My main work has been in the theory of elementary particles, and particularly in the unification of two of the forces of nature, the weak force which causes particles of one type to turn into particles of another type, and the electromagnetic force, which people are familiar with, which is responsible for electricity flowing through wires or for magnets attracting pieces of metal. It turns out that these are both aspects of the same underlying force which now has become called the electroweak force.;115;Motivation
These were two of the four forces of nature?;Steven Weinberg: Yes. I’ve also worked on the third force, the strong force. In fact, my work on the electroweak force grew out of my work on the strong force which is the force that holds quarks together inside the particles inside the nucleus of the atom. In that work, I had developed certain mathematical ideas that go by the name of broken symmetry, and shown how the … Well, I had not originated the idea of broken symmetry but I showed how it could be used to understand features of the strong force. Then it occurred to me suddenly, in 1967, that similar mathematical ideas would apply to the weak force and would allow us to unify it with the electromagnetic force in a very satisfactory theory. Other people, of course, have worked on the strong force and the electroweak force, and out of the work of many physicists came in the 1970s a theory of all the forces of nature, except for gravitation, known as the standard model.;115;Research
This is the one that you have been awarded the Nobel Prize for?;Steven Weinberg: The Nobel Prize came for the contribution to the electroweak force. Not for the strong force, where I was not, as far as the strong force is concerned I made contributions which I think were important, but not of the most important contributions.;115;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Coming back to cosmology. There is especially one statement in your book on cosmology, the popular one, The First Three Minutes, that was cited and also discussed very often. You wrote “the more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless”. Can you elaborate a little on that?;Steven Weinberg: That’s not the last sentence in the book. If you look at the book then there’s another paragraph that follows that, that explains what I meant, although perhaps I didn’t explain it very well. What I meant in that statement is that there is no point to be discovered in nature itself. There is no cosmic plan for us. We are not actors in a drama that has been written with us playing the starring role. There are laws, we are discovering those laws, but they’re impersonal, they’re cold. We are the result of billions of years of accidents that have led to us, governed by laws of nature that have no care for us. But then after saying that, I went on and said that if there is no point in nature, we can make a point for ourselves. We can find things to cherish that we value. We can love each other, we can create things that are beautiful, and also one of the things that some of us find to give point to our lives is to learn about nature. It’s not an entirely happy view of human life. I think it’s a tragic view, but that’s not new to physicists. A tragic view of life has been expressed by so many poets, that we are here without purpose, trying to identify something to care about. Even when we find the final laws of nature we won’t know why those are the correct laws of nature. But, although, for example, Shakespeare very often expresses a tragic view of life: “golden lads and girls all must, like chimney sweepers come to dust”. Our tragedy is a little different from his, from the heroes of Shakespeare’s plays. For Lear and Othello, the tragedy is in Shakespeare’s script, and what I like to say is that our tragedy is that there is no script.;115;Creativity
I just would like you, Professor Penzias, to start off with your great discovery. It has been described as one of the biggest discoveries the last century. It has changed the way we look at the universe. It confirmed the big bang theory. When did you and how did you realise that you were on something so big?;"Arno Penzias: Original work stemmed from the ideas that I had when going to Bell Labs that we had a small antennae which had unique properties. And in some sense as a physicist you sometimes, you may have one burning ambition to do one thing, but as a student, I had just finished my PhD and I was going to, I’d come to Bell Labs because I was attracted to this antennae. Because it had some very interesting properties. It was small and so because it was small it would not, it was better at looking at extended objects. A larger antennae would be more focussed to the single spot and it would be more sensitive to small objects. But this one was better at looking at more extended objects. So that by itself would not make an enormous difference, but the antennae was also very easy to calibrate and because of its odd shape was also, suit itself to having extraordinarily sensitive receivers. Receivers which would not be possible in a normal antennae configuration.
I got the antennae and I was going to put a 21 centimetre receiver in the antennae. But the antennae when I got inherited, had another receiver, a very sensitive amplifier cooled with liquid helium, which had been put there for a satellite project with 7 centimetres wavelength. In other words a shorter wavelength, the higher frequency. And so I thought, before I threw this thing out, what could I do with that wavelength and with that receiver and that system? The first thing I thought of was study the galaxy in a way that no one else had been able to do. After a period of very careful measurements, not just day to night, but seasonally. During the period we’re doing this other experiment, we finally got to the point where I realised that there is nothing wrong with this experiment that we can find.
But then the only question was what to do with it. And since I’d had a whole bunch of other astronomical results, what I resolved to do was write it up and put it in a section of another paper. And so at least I was reporting it, but I wouldn’t if it turned out to be somebody said, ‘Oh you jerk, you forgot so and so’, I wasn’t going to make any claim for it. So I was going to put it in another paper. I started radio astronomy in the 1950s when Charles Townes, my thesis adviser, thought of starting a radio astronomy group. And as a group we studied a series of papers, which had been put together in an American engineering journal called The Proceedings for the IEEE, the same; I think it was called, in them days it was called something else. And it turned out every one of those papers was wrong; every single one.
Radio astronomy except for a few things was just in such a primitive state that we were really very scared of making mistakes. So we did this for a long time and only then in 1965 when a colleague, when I was getting ready to publish this thing in that form in part of another paper, pointed out that there had been a preprint from a scientist that prints in university who had an explanation in terms of what others had called the gamma theory. And at that point we felt we would take the stuff and publish it and very conservatively next to another paper. And this is a whole series of things I wrote about in my Nobel Lecture about who did what and so forth. But then this was the first result this having to do with the how old is the universe.
And since there are so many crackpot ideas in physics, as for physics in those days, when I studied astrophysics at almost exactly at that time, the Hubble constant, the age of the universe; the age of the universe was about one and a half billion years at a time the geologists thought that the earth was five billion years old. So nothing really made a lot of sense in those days. So one had to be very careful and didn’t think that any one theory was going to be the right one.
So what I did and I’ll finish that thought. So we signed up with that one not expecting it to be the only one. In fact it wasn’t, there were two other explanations for it. And it turned out the first one was correct. But certainly it was not, I certainly never had the confidence to believe that some theory, which had been had so many other things wrong with it, was going to be the right one. And that the first one that we bumped into so to speak turned out to be the right explanation. So that was the start of that work.";117;Creativity
What did it teach you, in your life? I know you were very careful in the beginning and yet there was this amazing discovery that you made?;Arno Penzias: Well, that’s systematic. It’s I suppose it is, I’d always felt and I still do it, which is I’m quite meticulous. That’s something to do with my German upbringing I suppose. Early toilet training or whatever, I don’t know. But we really do, everything is done very carefully and absolutely in a precise way. You never do anything else. I remember one time speaking to a friend of mine who’s a psychologist. And I said to him, ‘Well you know I didn’t shine my shoes for, I got out the army and I think it was ten years before I shined my shoes. And I buy a car, I keep it for ten years. I paint it once half way through and then when it’s finally dead after ten years, I throw it away. I never wash it’. And he says ‘But everything inside works doesn’t it Arno?’ And I said ‘Yeah, everything inside works’. So that’s the kind of meticulous approach I’ve taken to science. That is that while I’m willing to be creative in other ways, I feel that measurements what to be done as precisely as possible.;117;Creativity
You worked at Bells over the years, was that also part of that? Did you have the same kind of way of looking at work when you went in and worked at Bells as the boss at the research?;"Arno Penzias: That was later. No that was two different things. When I was doing my own work, made my own research, I was always, that was a, my own astronomy research had always been very precise. I continued research even after being promoted several times and even until I became head of the research organisation in 1981. When I got this job at that point my responsibilities got so large that I think after my elevation to vice president, which is having about 1,000 PhDs working in my organisation and a budget of 100s of millions of dollars, it just stopped being fun to do astronomy. I still had a graduate student from Princeton and he got his thesis and that was finished and then I wrote one more paper, maybe two other papers after that. And I decided I just couldn’t be pulled in two directions. If I couldn’t do it well I didn’t want to do it as a hobby.
From that time on the things I did were really quite different. I had this organisation so I wanted to learn computer science, so I wrote a book on computers, which was a different, but it was a different sort of approach when you have to lead people. It’s a different kind of situation because you have to take risks, encourage other people to take chances. So it’s really quite different. In my own life, in the things that I do, I still do those things meticulously. And sometimes I do, in the calculations and such I probably take a rather, actually if I think about it, I take an accurate approach that is my results are I think in the work I’ve done since then, are accurate rather than precise. I step back more, so that try to understand what the important issues are and get an answer because it’s very different from questioning nature. There one has to make a decision based on, typically in a management position, even in what I would call leadership, social plan, in things which have economic or social consequences, you always have to make decisions on incomplete information. And so those are different.
In the case of physics, what we study artificially limited. We study, or at least very limited, very constrained questions and those physicists for instance measure things at either very cold, very hot, under tremendous pressure. So you try to push nature to its extremes in order to make measurements and then make them very precisely so you can get the measurements of nature. You can’t take the economy and twist it and put it into some argument.
I had a, on a totally different example there, in my organisation I had as I said 1,000 or more scientists, 100 department heads. And department heads and scientists would come with their PhDs and to become a department head was a nice thing. You got a secretary, you got promoted. So everyone, the idea, the ambition was to become, not the only ambition but for most people, becoming a department head was a big deal. Had 100 department heads and one of the nice things was we had a woman named Betsy Bailey who was an economist and she was a head of one of our economics departments and for a number of years. And then she left there and a very distinguished economist who went then to become head of the American Federal Aviation Administration. And I always liked having Betsy there because if on the rare occasion that we’d promoted a woman, we would then have two women department heads out of 100. And when the other one left we’d go back to one but then we’d often promote another one, so we’d always say the men and women who are department heads. We never had to say the men and woman, we could say men and women because we had two.
This went on for a while despite our best efforts and never promoted any women. One day the women came to me through a meeting. We had 100 women in my organisation and they said ‘You know why we are never promoted, when we never get the job. We’re always considered. And everybody wants to promote women, but we never get the job and do you know why?’ And I was here on this stage and 100 women you know and I thought I was a good guy. I thought we were doing our best and everything. What possible answer do we have? ‘Because we know why. Because we’re never the best qualified’. And they said why? I said ‘Well you have your best that you said’. ‘We have the same education as men though, but when the job comes up, we’re always considered. And we look at the two sets of experience. And the woman never has as good experience because they never get the really leading edge projects to work on. They’re always working on these other projects’. And because we get projects, nobody wants us to fail, so they seem to always give us the second best project, the safe project because we don’t have enough women, they’re helping us by giving us these safe projects. We never get the other projects. What do we do, how do we fix this?’ And I knew I couldn’t go back to the department heads and say ‘give women riskier projects; doesn’t work.
But this is an example of something that has nothing to do with precision. This is my other side, which is the wheeling and dealing side. And so I said, and I thought of this immediately, I said ‘Write a personal business plan’. ‘Personal business plan, what’s that?’ I said ‘put a horizontal line on a piece of paper. Put down a number which is the value, imagine that your project, whatever it is you’re going to do, is a success and give it a number. It could be dollars, or years of your life. I give five years, say you’re a medical student, I give ten years of my life to cure cancer, whatever. I said give a number, multiply it by the probability and divide it by the cost. So if that’s a big number do it, if it’s a small number don’t do it.
Well, it turned out that’s a very imprecise thing to do. And nobody knows exactly what the value is. And nobody knows exactly what the cost is and you don’t know what the probability is. Every one of those is a guess. But in the process of doing it, they first went to their department heads and the department heads came back and said ‘We don’t know its value’. So they said ‘Go ask the customer who is it going to benefit? Go and ask the beneficiary of this how much it’s worth to the beneficiary?’ So we don’t know who the beneficiary is. And all the women began to say ‘You’ve given me a job whose value you don’t know, who the beneficiary is you don’t know’. They started asking that question and within three years I think we had five or six or ten promotions and then my job today is held by one of the women that got promoted that time. So that’s another side. In some ways that’s an example of what you do when you’re a leader.";117;Environment
Was it difficult to make that transition for you from being a scientist to become a person which actually had to make completely different decisions?;"Arno Penzias: That’s an interesting question; I don’t know. I’ve always thought differently. I’ve never felt maybe from childhood on, I’ve never felt really part of anything. I’ve always felt a little special, a little different. I was born in Germany. I only found out I was different when my parents told me I couldn’t join the Hitler youth. You know they all say ‘Adolf Hitler, heil, heil’. You know I wanted to join because there were all these kids having this great time. And my parents said ‘No you’re not going to join that’.
What does that mean? And a lot of things happened after that. Came to America and being poor and a whole bunch of things. So I’ve always been on the side. So the great benefit of that is always big city, up on the corner of whatever room I’m in and seeing what’s going on. So there’s more pain involved, but there’s an awful lot of perspective and I guess that started it.";117;Motivation
Was that something that came maybe with age as well where you had achieved what you had achieved, the Nobel Prize?;Arno Penzias: I don’t know. I’m not sure. I don’t know where estimation came from. It’s certainly not something that, it’s a mystery to me. But I’ve become a very good, there’s almost nothing that I don’t estimate in some way and with whatever limited information I have. And it’s mysterious.;117;Impact of the Nobel on you
What do you see as the big questions then for example if you look at universe and cosmos, you know what was discussed at the Lindau meeting for example? You know the things we don’t know. Is it worth all the cost and effort when we look out in the universe?;"Arno Penzias: I think one of the things there is, the effort in most case is individual that is the people are investing years of their life. On the other hand, the most costly things are not necessarily the most important. In the case of particle physics very often it’s not the biggest machine that makes the breakthrough experiments; often the second biggest machine. Because people with the second biggest machine have to be a little more clever, right. It’s like the British empire was started by the second sons, the ones who didn’t inherit because in England you know they have the primogenitary there. The oldest son inherits everything and the others get a good education, have to go off. And the British empire you know at one point the second sons conquered the world. So because you’re in a position where you have to catch up, you maybe do a little bit better. So I’m not sure that it’s always necessary to have big and expensive things.
I was probably the most vocal opponent of the superconducting super collider. This was a machine, a particle physics machine, which was going to be put into Texas. It was huge, a huge thing. I’ve always been against the man space flight program. Some things need to be done on a national scale, but other things don’t have to be. And so I think it’s important for there to be dialogues and those informed dialogues are something that, what to be put into some kind of perspective and there ought to be a budget.";117;Future Research
Why were you against a man space?;Arno Penzias: Because it’s a stunt. You’re risking human lives. I mean I think putting a man on the moon at the time was a good idea and it was socially useful. In a sense it was like the two gorillas. Gorillas will go up and they’ll jump up and down and show their muscles to one another and the one that looks a little tougher than the other one goes away and nobody gets hurt. So that’s a nice thing to do. I mean I’m in the renaissance, you know, occasionally two armies would get together and the champions would have one little fight and then everybody would declare a winner without killing everybody. And I think between the United States and Russia, the fact that we got to the moon in America before the Russians did, said something about whether communism is really the future of the world and so forth. So for the man on the moon project’s ok, but beyond that, the rest of it makes really no sense.;117;Roles of Science
So they could rather put robots in space?;"Arno Penzias: Oh much better. Oh it’s much better. I mean I think it’s stupid and inhuman to put, I mean this poor, they put this teacher some years ago in this rocket and the poor lady burnt to death. Do you remember they had this crash of a rocket? And how could a teacher teach a class from space; what does she see? She looks out a port hole like that. Sit down here at Lindau and have a nice cup of coffee, have some strudel and watch a video camera that’s up in space that’s all, the only difference. And you don’t have to throw up on the way up because of weightlessness. Why would anyone do this? But it benefited people who I think in that case it’s just a bureaucracy feeding its own end. So I’m very much against the space program.";117;Roles of Science
Does the scientist have some kind of responsibility to voice this do you think?;Arno Penzias: But they do. I mean scientists do. The president of the American physical society, or there’s, I think in the case of the space program man space flight, I think the majority of scientists don’t go along with it, but it’s something every country likes and everyone wants to put up an astronaut in these things. But I think it’s a dreadful, personally I think it’s a dreadful idea. But you know I’m not an expert in this field, but I think it is not something that I really think is valuable. There’s a lot one can do, certainly the space one telescopes, the probes in our galaxy. But the satellite the work, I mean just simple things like global positioning, which makes airplanes safer and then people convenience in cars, all the studies of nature and its behaviours, predicting hurricanes, there’s enormous amount of information. So a space program I think is a great and beneficial both on the scientific, but much more on the practical side. I think space program’s a wonderful thing.;117;Role of Science
Do you think that one day with the kind of experiment that goes on and the ideas that we are formulating here on earth, that we will know whether there’s life after universe?;Arno Penzias: I doubt it. I really doubt it. I doubt it, but I could be wrong because I can’t think of an experiment that would do this. It’s probably the only question about where I care much more about the question than the answer. If we say that in our galaxy there are probably 200,000 million suns in our galaxy alone. And there are more than 100,000 million other galaxies. So think how many stars that is. And if among all those stars we are alone, we’re the only ones. I mean it just makes me shiver. It’s such a, it’s like you know you’re standing up, all of a sudden realise that there’s a cliff over here. It just makes me shiver. On the other hand if we’re not alone also makes me shiver. I mean either case we come back to the same question that was asked in the book of Ecclesiastes: What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man that taketh notice of him. And they just, you know what is all this all about? Is it really as meaningless as scientist force themselves to believe?;117;Future Research
I would like to start off by asking you what made you interested in physics at the very beginning. Why did you choose that subject?;Leo Esaki: When I was at high school I had the opportunity of what kind of field I should go into. This is during the war. Distraction, Japanese suffer of that. I was at high school and university. At that time I liked to get fundamental knowledge in that circumstance and I wanted more basic knowledge in the natural science, physics certainly most fundamental. If you know physics I think you can do many other things. During the psychology of war you like to know – before you die – to understand the most fundamental things.;129;Motivation
Did you want to be part of rebuilding Japan?;Leo Esaki: This is after the war. I entered university in 1944 and I graduated university -47. The war ended in -45. I entered Tokyo Imperial University and after the war when I graduated just Tokyo University. After I graduated Japan was in a bad situation. Everything was destructed and Japanese industry business was in poor condition. I could have stayed at the university to study, but I decided to go into industry.;129;Environment
Was it better for you to go into industry rather than stay on at university?;Leo Esaki: I thought I could contribute to the Japanese industry because the Japanese economy and industry were so bad so this was my prime motivation to go into industry.;129;Environment
You made your major discovery in 1957 which then you were awarded the Nobel Prize for, that was at Sony. After that you moved to the United States. Was that a difficult transition for you, to go from Japan to the United States in 1957 or -60?;"Leo Esaki: What do you mean difficult? It was easy because I got many offers from the United States, in that aspect very easy, I just accepted one. Of course culture is very different between Japan and the United States so that made it slightly difficult. Way of thinking and how you do many things different. Sort of a cultural shock for me to move from Japan to the United States. But science is a more international enterprise, it’s a global enterprise. As a scientist I don’t think it was much of a problem. It was more problems of daily life, a different lifestyle. Even the language English – Japanese to English is a big difference – so that created some problems of course.
After two years I decided to stay in the United States, but I had a call from Japan, so I had another culture shock – from United States to go back to Japan. In the United States I worked in industry. As I mentioned, after graduating my university I entered Japanese industry, I changed from American industry, but I got an offer from Japan, I was called from the President of the National University. I went from scientist in a private industry to educator at this national university. The culture shock once again, United States to Japan, industrial researcher to government educator.";129;Environment
I would like to come back to your move going back from United States to Japan just in a moment, but to stay in the United States for a little bit longer: you were working at IBM, what was it there that you found useful working the industry over those years? You said as a scientist it wasn’t difficult, but daily life was a shock. As a scientist at IBM, what culture did you find there that was creative for a scientist of your status?;Leo Esaki: I joined IBM in 1960 and then after a few years I was elected IBM Fellow. Being a Fellow is I was given freedom, suddenly. More obligation to the company but I could do anything I wanted, so I got the idea to make a man-made quantum structure. Superlattices is one of the man-made quantum structures. I’m a material scientist and usually you study many materials, but I got the idea that I’d like to create material, I like to design, I like to engineer man-made materials. This is a new avenue of material science. We like to make man-made material that doesn’t exist in nature. These synthesized new materials had totally new properties. The materials – usually God gave these materials to us – gold and silver. God gives us creativity so I can make and create materials which God never gives us. The new materials had very many interesting properties, we started those programmes. In material science somebody has to prepare the materials. Somebody has to make the measurements – this is not one man’s effort. I organised a group, not a very big group, about ten people, to work with me. This is the basic research, not very committed.;129;Environment
Can I come back to when you moved back from the United States to Japan, you said it was a culture shock. What were the biggest difficulties at that time? Was there something you wanted to bring with you from America that was difficult to implement in Japan?;Leo Esaki: That the culture is very different between Japan and the United States is one thing, but the other is that in the United States I was a researcher, but in Japan I’m President of that university which is more an educator. For scientists, you need more creative minds. For an educator, you need a judicious mind because it’s a national university. You’re a bureaucrat, a government officer.;129;Environment
Do you miss that part of the creativeness as a researcher when you had to go back and be more of an educator?;Leo Esaki: I think I missed the research, I missed that direct contact of that activities.;129;Creativity
Is there also a difference in the hierarchical structure within the research departments if you compare between the United States and Japan? Has the Japanese a more hierarchical structure and in which way could that either enhance or diminish creativity?;Leo Esaki: United States is more bottom-up kind of activity for research but Japan is generally top down, so that’s slightly different. But certainly in Japan that is changing very fast now to give more opportunities to young scientists and young people, to be more encouraged and creative. History tells us to progress science you need two things. One is individual creativity, the other is the dynamic interaction among scientists. That dynamic interaction is very active in the United States, so that’s one of the progresses for the United States’ scientists, very easy dynamic interactions – more open with things. Of course individual creativity is more fundamental, necessarily.;129;Creativity
My last question, Professor, would be: what is out there to discover? What is your biggest question mark? If you had a wish list, what would you ask somebody or what is the big discovery to be done in physics?;Leo Esaki: We still need a breakthrough in many ideas. Communication, computer fields. One breakthrough we can expect is quantum computers and quantum telecommunications, using the principle of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics – already in the 20th century that was formulated, quantum mechanics implemented many things, but the 21st century we will use principle of quantum mechanics, there is one principle of the super position, the super position principle. If you use those principles, you can make quantum computers which is a vast improvement of the present computers. If you use that quantum communication you can use the cryptography. You cannot decode your code, you could make very safe communication. I think that’s one of the fields which is a big project of the Japanese government in quantum telecommunications, and I’m organising these activities. We need individual creativity to make these kinds of things, I think this is one of the important things. The communication is very important to everybody. Everybody has a portable phone and a PC, and we still need improvement in those fields.;129;Future Research
You said you were working at General Electric. You left Norway at quite an early age to move to Canada and eventually you came to the United States. What made you leave Norway and with what kind of spirit did you go?;Ivar Giaever: I was not a very good student and I had mediocre grades from Norway, but I had no difficulty at getting a job, but I could not get a place to live. This was in 1952-53 and it was impossible to get a place to live. I was married with a child, and we tried to do that and we couldn’t do it. Then what precipitated the move was that I roomed with a friend of mine in Oslo. My wife stayed up in the country with her parents with the child. He said: You have to go and register to a waiting line, and I said: No, I’m not going to do that because a waiting line is eight years. I’m not going to wait for eight years, no way. He said: Register anyway. He took me down to the office and I registered and then the guy said: Where does your wife live? and I said: Up in the country with her parents. And he said: You can’t register now because your wife doesn’t live in Oslo. I recognised this is what we call “catch 22” in the United States and so I left. I got so … I didn’t get mad, but I recognised I wanted to leave, so I went to Canada because it was very easy to get a visa to Canada at that time. United States took about a year, but I left actually three weeks later to Canada.;130;Environment
In what spirit did you leave? You seem to be a person who goes out, looks for opportunities, a very entrepreneurial spirit. Did you have that with you from the beginning?;"Ivar Giaever: No, I don’t think so. I think that’s something I’ve learned in America, in Canada and in the United States. When I got to Canada it was very, very difficult to get a job because Canadian economy even today is seasonal. I came there before Christmas and they said: Merry Christmas, why don’t you come back in the Spring when we hire people? We came to Canada with $200, that’s because that’s all the money you’re allowed to bring out of Norway; $100 per person, so I know exactly what kind of money I’ve had.";130;Creativity
Were you into science already then? Did you know you wanted to do research?;"Ivar Giaever: No. Absolutely not. As I said I was a mediocre student and when I worked in Canada, General Electric had a course, they called it A course and a B course and a C course for over three years to try to teach engineers more science. At that time it wasn’t common to have a PhD degree in engineering. I took the A course in Canada and I liked that a lot and I worked very hard. Sooner or later you’ve got to work hard to catch up for what you haven’t done. Then they didn’t have the B course, but in the United States they had a B course. I also found out that they made 30 percent more money in the United States than in Canada, so the choice was easy. I left and went to the United States.
To tell the true story really, as I said, in Norway I had very bad grades and in Norway the grades were such that one zero is the best you can get, six zero is the worst you can get and four zero you’re just about failing, like a D in the United States. I got four zero in mathematics and four zero in physics. When I got down to General Electric, I was interviewed and the guy says: Oh, I see you have good grades, four zero in mathematics and four zero in physics, so you must be pretty good, because of course four zero is the best you can get in the United States. I’m normally an honest person, but I have to admit that I just mumbled something at that particular point. I didn’t think that was the right time to explain to him what the difference in grade meant.";130;Motivation
You stayed on at General Electric didn’t you? I mean what kind of an environment was it?;Ivar Giaever: It was wonderful when I came because General Electric had this what they call the test program and they hired engineers and you could work with different people for maybe an assignment for three to six months at the time. I worked, I came down to Connecticut in New York. I looked at all the people who were there and I picked up the most famous people. And the people said: Oh no, you shouldn’t do that because these people are very difficult to work for. But I stuck to that, and I wanted to work for these famous people and that paid off very generously for me.;130;Environment
In which way were they inspiring you, these people?;Ivar Giaever: Because they were people who were exceedingly well thought of, were very good. I worked for a German mathematician for example named Buechner. He was a fantastic person, and it worked this way. Then I thought I was going to be an applied mathematician, so I worked with him, then at that time, right before the computers really, so we worked in parallel. We have a problem and then you have to write down the equations, square root of two and plus and minus, and you make mistakes. Every week we worked in parallel and then every week we compared the results. And every week when we got in there, if we did not agree, he calmly took my paper and said: Let me see where you have gone wrong. I was always wrong and he was always right, so I recognised I couldn’t compete with him so I had to do something simpler like physics.;130;Mentor(Role Models)
It seems that during your time at General Electric … You both had to feed a family and you were working very hard and you learnt a lot. Was there a change? You said you went into physics, did you then realise that science was your topic?;Ivar Giaever: As I said I was on this General Electric program where you have different assignments and I had an assignment at General Electric research lab. Then I made what I call my biggest discovery. I discovered that people could get paid for doing research. I was completely flabbergasted. I never even heard of that. And these people ran around, sat on the windowsill discussed things, wrote on the blackboard, looked like they had a good time. I said that’s what I wanted to do, so after I was finished I went and I asked if I could get a job there. And I was fortunate, they hired me on a trial period for a year, and they never said I was hired really. Nobody remembered I was hired on a trial, or something. I was very lucky because basically they don’t hire people who don’t have a PhD degree, so I was just lucky. There was a man named John Fisher who took care of me. He was a wonderful person.;130;Creativity
Did any of this spirit that you have carried with you filtered down to your children, or to people around you? Have they learnt from you?;Ivar Giaever: I don’t know. I can’t call on that. I’m very happy with my kids and my wife, and my kids have been very successful. I have one child who’s in biophysics and has a PhD degree and working for Stanford, so they’ve all done very well in their own field.;130;Personal Characteristics
In one of your lectures that I recently heard, you were talking about how to start the business and specifically for United States, but there were some general tips and ideas that you came up with. For you, what was the reason to become an entrepreneur and start your own business a few years back?;Ivar Giaever: The reason for that was that in 1988 I left General Electric. The reason I left General Electric is that we got a new director and his motto or whatever you want to call it, was that from now on, he said, all research has to be directly connected with present General Electric processes and products. I was working with biology and I wasn’t connected at all. It wasn’t that he didn’t like my work, but I was sort of an embarrassment because I was not directly connected with General Electric, so we decided in a sort of mutual decision that I should leave, and I’m very happy that I left. I should have left before as a matter of fact because I like it at the university, so that was very good. But I worked with a friend at General Electric named Charles Keese and when I left to RPI, he wasn’t willing to go. Then I went and after a year he said: I’d like to come too, but then I lost my negotiation powers. I didn’t have any powers because I already was there, so he came on soft money. That means in the United States that you have to get grants to support yourself, and we found out that to be very difficult and then we decided that it was maybe easier to get grants for doing business. You can get that in the United States, called a SBIR program, small business innovating research program. This is a wonderful program where they then give grants to small businesses to try out things and we were successful in doing that. But when we started the business, I was not very happy about that because I didn’t really regard myself as a business person, but now I’m very happy about it because it’s a different thing.;130;Motivation
You said in your lecture that scientists are not good business people, is that true?;Ivar Giaever: That is probably true because you think, I mean what you think is that here you do this wonderful science, this wonderful thing, and now people will come and buy these things from you, but they absolutely don’t because what you do is very difficult, to get it known among the people who need these things. And scientists also tend to be careful, so you do science, you want to have things exactly right, you want to do this and that. When you’re in business you can’t afford that. If you do something and it works, you’ve got to go with that because otherwise you have nothing. But if you’re a scientist, oh no I want to work on this for another couple of years, see if I can make it better. In that sense, I don’t think scientists are good businessmen including myself.;130;Creativity
What did you do in your business to make it shoot up?;Ivar Giaever: We started this business, my friend and I, Charlie Keese and I, and basically we started the business to get money to do research. We weren’t really thinking so much of making a real business, but a few years ago we got, as a third person joining us, a very wonderful guy named Chris Dennett who knows how to sell things, he knows how to market things. He came and said: You know ‘I’d like to join you guys, and that was a good decision on us and now we work together all three of us and it looks like it’s working out very well. By the time this is actually going on to the internet, we’ll probably be all broke, but that’s ok.;130;Environment
Advice to young people who want to go into science today, or who are already studying maybe, and see that it’s difficult to find a possibility to do the basic research and has to be more worried about the future of having to maybe go into the industry and applied research, which is more common today. What is your advice? How could one think?;Ivar Giaever: Let me tell you what John Fisher told me when I came to General Electric. When I came I was then 30 years old and I said to him that I’d really like to learn some physics, but actually I know I’m too old to make any discovery in physics because most physicists do that when they’re in their twenties or something. John said to me: No, no you’re not too old, he said. You make discoveries when you’re learning. If you start learning at 30, you can still make discoveries. And, he said, I give you the advice that when you’ve worked in physics for a while maybe you should change your field again because then you learn again. The fun thing in life is just learning different things. I don’t understand this business about fundamental science and basic research and applied research and things because I don’t think people recognise that we know almost everything today. The science is not an infinite field, it’s a finite field and a certain number of rules and we practically know all the rules in science today. People don’t agree with me with that, but that’s my particular feeling. So therefore, I think that if I give people advice today I think the action is going to be making inventions in the future. I think that’s what people should try to do. See how they can make invention, how they make things better, how they combine different things. I think that’s where the action is going to be. Like the laser for example is really an invention. Take the knowledge of what they had and invent the laser. Magnetic imaging is an invention and people should just think about how can they do things better and invent things better. There are no new laws that are going to come out, maybe one or two, but basically we know most of the things.;130;Advice for young researchers
What is the big challenge then if you look at the medical side for example?;Ivar Giaever: I work in biology and there is no law in biology. All the laws in biology comes from chemistry and physics, but the exciting thing is to work in biology because it’s easy to state problems and a lot of unknown things. For example, I sit here and talk to you and tomorrow you’ll remember hopefully some of that. That means that I have changed your brain. Maybe I have damaged your brain, I don’t know.;130;Future Research
Professor Josephson, welcome to this interview. We’re very happy to have you here today. You were very young when you got the prize, only 33, and when you made your major discovery you were 22. In which way has this had an impact on your life, to start off with?;Brian Josephson: It’s made it very busy. I get lots of invitations, most of which I have to turn down. It’s given me a bit more freedom in that I can work on my interests which are on the unconventional side, without people feeling that they can say: You can’t work on that. Some things are a bit of a nuisance, the amount of correspondence one gets, with a corresponding increase in secretarial help. So it has its good and bad sides and it does not seem to help one get grants I’m afraid.;131;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Is it important to be young? I mean you were very young. Is that the height of your creativity or what is the major quality that you need?;Brian Josephson: I suppose being young helped. I was a bit of a child prodigy so maybe I was more likely to see deep ideas than most people. But I feel that I’m still just as creative and in fact the work I’ve doing on the brain I think that’s in a way more significant and more difficult than the superconductivity work.;131;Creativity
You say your creativity is just as great now as it was, that’s your feeling. It has nothing to do with age but it has to do with curiosity?;Brian Josephson: Yes, I think curiosity has a lot to do with it.;131;Creativity
Next year is the year that UNESCO have announced that that’s the year of Einstein. Do you think it’s important to highlight these great scientists to make the public in general understand the need for science?;Brian Josephson: Yes, I suppose. I think scientists themselves would want to celebrate Einstein since he had such an important role. I guess it may be a good thing to help in presenting science to the public since everybody’s heard of Einstein, so it’s really more an excuse than anything else, but there it is.;131;Role of Science
Is it difficult for scientists to at times explain or make the public at large understand the need for science?;Brian Josephson: Perhaps the problem is the range of abilities of the public in that some people,e they can tune easily into anything, whereas other people you have to talk in a very low brow way and grossly oversimplify.;131;Creativity
Do you feel that there is a great interest in science among young people today? What do you encounter?;Brian Josephson: To some extent. Certainly the students here seem very interested in the Lindau meeting. But I think there’s been some turning away from science perhaps because people find it – I’m talking about the UK – that’s because people feel it’s a difficult subject and perhaps it’s not being presented as interesting. It’s a presentation problem I suppose. Or also perhaps the difficulty in getting good teachers in school. If you have a teacher who doesn’t really understand science, he or she is not going to inspire the pupils.;131;Motivation
If you compare basic to applied research and science, what is your feeling around that? It has been maybe more a drive towards to applied research over the last 10, 15 years particularly. Industry is so focused on it.;Brian Josephson: I feel it’s politicians as well. Some politicians don’t quite seem to understand what science is and they only think of it as something which produces practical spin offs. But I suppose the climate has changed anyway, certainly at the Cavendish where I work there’s a great emphasis on practical applications. Of course that is important if they can produce discoveries that are of practical importance. But when I was younger it seemed to be quite acceptable to do pure research and now it’s seemingly not so important, not so accepted.;131;Meaning(Values) of Work
Is there a difference between America and Europe do you think? It seems like many scientists did at least move to America and for different reasons, but often to where they will … Particularly after they had an award or have made major discoveries, they were asked to come over to America. Do you see a change? Do you think it’s changing in Europe?;Brian Josephson: That move to America is probably because there are more resources available there. I don’t know if it’s so applicable these days. One thing about public understanding of science is that TV programmes are probably quite important in getting people’s interest and there seems to have been a feeling that the programmers must entertain, which to some extent is at the cost of the science.;131;Environment
Can one do science more entertaining do you think – for example the research that you are involved with? Could that be made in such a way that people could find it entertaining?;Brian Josephson: They make it entertaining with add-ons like music or jazzy effects. It’s very distracting from the science and very annoying to real scientists, so I think it’s not good. Again it’s a phenomenon of our times.;131;Creativity
Is there any specific advice that you could give to young scientists that might listen to this interview?;Brian Josephson: I think I might duck on that one, because I don’t know any real answers. I don’t know whether we might talk a bit about my campaign for, let’s see, when I talked about pathological disbelief …;131;Advice for young researchers
Is it so that you have to have patience as well. We talked about advice to young students, there have been examples of scientific discoveries that were almost seen as nonsense and then almost as an embarrassment, and then of course turned out to be major discoveries. Could that be an advice to young people that they need to have the courage of standing up for your fight?;Brian Josephson: It’s not so practical for graduate students because they only have a limited length of time and they may just not get anything accepted at all, so it’s more for people who are already established that they have to be patient.;131;Advice for young researchers
What would you like to see as an alternative if you feel that there is a difficulty to get certain issues discussed or papers published? What could be an alternative if it at the moment is not as open minded as you would like to see?;Brian Josephson: There are some journals that are more open minded but the problem is that they’re ignored by the scientists, so something must be done forcefully to bring scientists into contact with reality, that’s how I see it. A lecture such as the one I’ve just given does make the point rather forcibly and perhaps that will have an effect. Once people start to understand that errors are still being made like the continental drift area which people ignored extremely strong evidence for continental drift and if people can start to understand that the same kind of errors are happening today they must try as well as possible not to condemn something unless the arguments are clear. What actually happens is that the people who try to put down these subjects are arguing unscientifically but somehow they are authorities and people take what they say rather uncritically.;131;Creativity
Just to finish off this interview, if I may ask on a more personal note, are there any memories from Stockholm that you are particularly fond of when you were there as a young person, 33 years old, one of the youngest Nobel laureates of any time?;Brian Josephson: An ice rink readily available near the hotel.;131;Impact of the Nobel on you
I know. I believe it’s the fifth time you are visiting Lindau, and this very particular meeting where scientists and young scientific students meet. What is it that makes you come back for the fifth time?;Leon N. Cooper: Actually I didn’t remember that it was the fifth time. Each time is different. This time in particular I’m interested because it’s a meeting of medicine – doctors and physiologists. I’m a theoretical physicist that has been working in the areas of neuroscience, and basically I’m on a mission to convince the medical and the physiologists that a theoretical physicist can make a contribution to their field. Basically, to be more direct, theory has played an enormously important role in physics, and physicists understand the interaction between theory and experiment. But this is relatively new in neuroscience, and what I would like to do is to present an example of how theory can be useful in neuroscience. And we have lots, I think we have a very convincing case, but we’ll wait to see what the experts say.;133;Advice for young scientists
If we just turn the clock back a little bit and look backwards to what you have achieved, when you were about 28, 27 years old. Could you have imagined what you then found out, what use it would have at that time?;Leon N. Cooper: That’s a good question, because we were interviewed over and over toward the end of the 1950s, and the first question was: What are the practical applications of this great theoretical breakthrough? We listed all kinds of things like superconducting power lines, and things of that kind, and some of them are actually coming to pass. Yes, fifty years later, but the most important by far is what’s called the superconducting quantum interference device, based on what is known as the Josephson effect, which we didn’t even know existed at the time. That came just a few years later, and that’s now, it’s a way of measuring magnetic fields that’s far more sensitive, and it’s just used everywhere. It’s used in all kinds of devices, all kinds of electronic devices. And you see, that’s the amusing thing. It was a consequence of our theory, but it wasn’t one that we … You know, I wish I had foreseen it, but then I sometimes kick myself for not having foreseen it, but we didn’t. At least, I didn’t. It’s typical of what happens in scientific discovery, that you don’t necessarily foresee all of the consequences of what you yourself have done.;133;Creativity
Is it important to be humble as a scientist?;Leon N. Cooper: I wouldn’t say that, we’re all pretty arrogant.;133;Competencies
The work that you’re doing at the moment is to see the way the mind works, to simplify it. What is the … you want to have a talk tomorrow, you’re on a mission, you say, but what can you see in the future, what uses can this have?;Leon N. Cooper: First of all there are an enormous number of mental diseases of all kinds. Everything from mood diseases to schizophrenia, to all kinds of things, and hopefully, if you understand how the system works, you would be able to do something about repairing some of those problems. And I have a personal opinion that many of the worst problems might be a little easier than people expect, because it’s so easy to alter moods. We have various conceptual reasons for believing that things like memory consolidation and moods are influenced by overall factors and so you could make therapeutic interventions. We don’t know, of course, how effective they will be or whether they would work. You would never know before you actually do it, but there’s every reason to believe that you could have substantial help in various mental diseases, and then of course there’s the intellectual challenge of seeing how a biological system, how neurons put themselves together to process information and eventually how we achieve our mental states and so on. It’s an enormous intellectual challenge, and you don’t really know what the consequences are, but we can say from a past history that there will be consequences, we can’t foresee them all, and the chances are that some of them will be of immense importance.;133;Future Research
It obviously still gives you a lot of satisfaction to do this work. What are the biggest challenges on a daily basis?;Leon N. Cooper: Getting out of bed in the morning. Getting enough caffeine into use so your mind starts functioning.;133;Creativity
Do you think that the prize gave you a better opportunity to do your work, the Nobel Prize, back in 1972?;Leon N. Cooper: Oh sure, it gives you additional opportunities to get financing, to get people to make foolish statements, people are always asking you to express your opinions about things you don’t know anything about. You have to be a little careful. But sure, of course it gives you opportunities, and I think used properly, carefully, it’s a tremendous advantage, a tremendous advantage. Also, it’s somewhat of a burden, because in the sense that people look at what you do differently, they judge it differently. There’s always the question of what are you going to do next. If you worry about that you just can’t do anything, and basically you just do next what is next, and you don’t worry about it too much. I mean, not every problem you work on is of a Nobel Prize calibre. It would be ridiculous to even think that way. Sometimes it evolves, sometimes it doesn’t.;133;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I believe that you have also, for example, spoken out on political issues. I have seen letters that you have signed, for example, in the problems back in the 1980s in Poland and so on. Do the Nobel Prize winners have a special responsibility, do you think, as well, in certain fields?;Leon N. Cooper: I think I have a responsibility, just as every other citizen, to express myself on issues, if I feel I have any competence, or have an opinion, and I don’t do it too often but I sometimes do, and if having the Nobel Prize helps then that’s fine. But, sure, but although you do, again, you have to be careful because you can easily abuse the privilege, and find yourself … I mean, I’m asked to sign things that I know nothing about whatsoever. And I try to avoid that.;133;Roles of Science
Do you think the climate for scientific studies and for scientists in general is better in the United States than in Europe? There were some talks about that today, briefly mentioned …;Leon N. Cooper: I think probably it has its ups and downs, but for many years it was very good in the United States. I think Europe is coming up in certain fields. It’s a question of support, the openness of universities, the freedom to do research, the absence of stifling influences from above, and I think the United States has been freer in that respect. But we have our bad periods, too. There are always politicians, people are the same, there are always politicians, there are always people who will stifle research by saying you should do one thing and not do another. But it’s just harder to do in the United States, because in the United States there are so many centres of power that it’s a little more difficult, but still the agencies in the United States that provide the money for research have enormous influence and they can be stifled by the Congress. The Congress is often trying to do that. The most recent example is stem cell research. But there are always the po … you know, talk about arrogance. You have politicians literally telling scientists what the best way to do their research is, which is something even more than ludicrous, wouldn’t you say?;133;Environment
What would your advice be to a young scientific student who would listen in to this interview eventually, on the internet?;Leon N. Cooper: I think that any person who is interested in science and is willing to work and to have the discipline should do it. Advice in what respect? Should they go into science, or should they … what country should they go to?;133;Advice for young researchers
If you have these kind of from above and lack of money situation, control, it’s not only that you maybe have to do your scientific studies, you also have to take another fight?;Leon N. Cooper: It’s not that bad. The situation … What would be more accurate is to say that the situation has its ups and downs, like most of history, and some periods are a little better, some periods are a little worse. It’s just like the general economic environment. There are some areas in science that become hot, and if you get your PhD there you have a hundred jobs waiting for you, and in other areas you can’t find a job, and five years later it’s just the reverse. It’s somewhat aggravating, but it’s not that different from the economics of the entire community, but I think the main thing is that there are enormous opportunities in science, and for people who can do it and are willing to do the work there is almost always something. But again, there may be some fields that suddenly become over-populated, and some areas that suddenly become less fashionable. It’s unfortunate because it takes, it’s a long-time commitment to become a scientist, and you may go into an area that is not fashionable by the time you get out of it. But I don’t know what to advise about that. If I were, as far as national policy is concerned, my own feeling is it should be kept on a steady course, and not go back and forth with fashions. But politicians don’t listen to that, either.;133;Environment
We’re coming to the end of the interview. What is maybe your greatest memory from your time as a scientist? Is there one particular memory that you would like to share with us?;Leon N. Cooper: I suppose my greatest memories are of working together on some of the major problems that I’ve solved with other people and realising that I had the solution. It’s simply enormously exciting, but you know, I would almost say that some of the greatest pleasures I’ve had are in smaller problems that no-one has ever heard of, that were just so exciting. The thrill of having just mastered them, but I suppose the quick answer is that I can’t come up with something that sounds like the major major memory to me. Do people, when you ask that question, do people immediately have a memory?;133;Life
But you speak lots of languages. How many languages can you speak?;Murray Gell-Mann: Well, that’s not actually true. That’s another story they make up about me. I’m very interested in languages and I know something about the relations among languages, about the entomologies, about sound changes from one language to another and so on and so forth. Very interested in that, and even in helping a little bit to work on it. But as to speaking languages, any European waiter could do much better than I.;138;Personal Characteristics
You have found that one word that has got the fame, I would say, and also was named in another prize, and that is quark and quarks. What does that come from?;Murray Gell-Mann: Well, let’s see. In the citation for the award, it was barely mentioned. But I did propose that the neutron and proton and the related barions were composed, roughly speaking, of three quarks each, and that the quarks were the fundamental entities, they are analogous to the electron, and that the neutron, proton and so on were not elementary. The word I had first as a sound, quark. It might have been spelled K W O R K, for example. But then I thought it was the right sound for the fundamental constituents of nuclei. Sounds, sounds good.;138;Creativity
So how can you make models or series of these histories that are based on accidents?;Murray Gell-Mann: Well, we, the fundamental laws give you the probabilities. But you have to adjoin to that information a lot of information about the accidents that have already occurred, and especially these important ones which we can call frozen accidents which create a great deal of regularity in the future. And by complexity, then, what I call effective complexity, we mean the length of a very concise description of the regularities of something.;138;Creativity
If I change the subject for a while, you have travelled to the tropics, and you were also engaged in environmental issues?;Murray Gell-Mann: Yes, very much, in trying to preserve the heritage of biological diversity. I’m also somewhat interested in the preservation of cultural diversity, although that involves a great many more paradoxes and contradictions. But I’ve worked hard on trying to help with the preservation of biological diversity around the world, and of course on land the greatest diversity is found in the tropics, and also the tropics are full of poor and, in many cases, overpopulated countries.;138;Motivation
I have one last question about the birds. What is your dream now that you would like to encounter?;Murray Gell-Mann: Oh, there are many species. I’ve seen less than 4,000 out of 9,600 or something like that. Almost 10,000 species that are recognised in the world. But there are a few special ones that it would be wonderful to see. The Congo peacock, for example.;138;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
I would like to ask you about lasers that you are the inventor of and also that you got your Nobel Prize in, masers and lasers, you got your Nobel Prize for, I would say that the whole generation of people today were not even born when you did this invention and discovery, but how did you start thinking about masers?;Charles H. Townes: I was especially interested in trying to generate some short wavelengths to do spectroscopy, in other words the study of molecules and atoms. It was basic science I was interested in, I wasn’t worried about applications and so on, and so I tried very hard to find new ways of producing radiation, particularly radiation as small as a fraction of a millimetre, I wanted to get to shorter wavelengths. We could already get to wavelengths down to about three millimetres, centimetres and millimetres and so on, but I wanted to get to a fraction of a millimetre, so I worked at it very hard, I tried a lot of different … I tried several different ways and they didn’t work terribly well until I had the right idea finally.;145;Life
Why did you need those shorter wavelengths? What was the need for the shorter wavelengths?;Charles H. Townes: I wanted those shorter wavelengths in order to do science, because we didn’t have those shorter wavelengths and I wanted to study molecules in particular, the structure of molecules and the structure of atoms and the characteristic of nuclei and so on within the molecules, that’s what I wanted.;145;Creativity
So you were allowed to do basic science in the war?;Charles H. Townes: I was lucky in a way! It was a failure you see, a failure to get the right job, I had to take this job, but then I learned a lot from it and then that frequently happens, success grew out of failure. But Bell Lab was a good place, it was really a very good place.;145;Motivation
Do you remember the moment of this discovery of maser?;"Charles H. Townes: I certainly do.
Charles H. Townes: I certainly do, it was quite a moment. I had been working very hard and thinking of different ways, some ways of producing short waves, and I’d even been made a chairman of the department for the … chairman of a committee rather … for the country to try to examine how to produce short waves. Our committee travelled around and looked at what people were trying to do and so on, and we just didn’t come up with any good ideas. We would have our last meeting in Washington DC and just before that last meeting I woke up early in the morning because I was worried about that we hadn’t been able to do anything.
I went out, I sat in the park, a beautiful day, and the flowers were blooming and it was sunny. I sat on the bench and now why haven’t we been able to do this, and I went through all the possibilities we had thought of, you see, and I had thought of, things I had tried and this didn’t work and this didn’t work very well, why can’t we do it now. I thought if we could get radiation from molecules – molecules can produce very short wavelengths – but how can we do that … Ah, wait a minute, wait a minute … I thought, yes, this is the way to do it. Oh yes, we can do it from molecules. We get molecules in the right kind of state and that can happen. Ah, and it was exciting.
It was exciting and I went back to my hotel room and I was in the same hotel room with Arthur [Schawlow] who was a post doc with me at the time, and I told him about it, he said Oh well, yeah, that sounds alright. Then I went back to Colombia and after a little while I got a student to work on it and we eventually made it work.";145;Creativity
What did your colleagues say about your idea?;Charles H. Townes: It’s interesting, you see, many new ideas people won’t believe!;145;Creativity
So how did you manage they would say to be angry instead to be discouraged?;Charles H. Townes: Well, that’s part of science. If you’re going to do something original, you have to be prepared to differ with people. It’s very important to be able to differ with people. You listen to people, listen to other people’s ideas carefully, and examine your own ideas, to be sure you’re not wrong, you see, and let them criticise and thing about it, be sure you’re not wrong, but you’ve got to make your own decisions. If you’re going to do anything original then you carefully make your own decisions.;145;Dealing with difficulties
Could you ever imagine what will become of both masers and then lasers especially?;"Charles H. Townes: I knew that masers and lasers would be important and I could see some applications for them, but I couldn’t possibly foresee all the applications, many of the things in fields that I weren’t familiar with for example. I wrote a paper with a doctor, a doctor wanted to see what lasers might do for medicine, and so we wrote a paper about it in the early days shortly after laser was invented, but I had never heard of a detached retina in the eye, and he didn’t mention it to me, so that was not one of the things we put down in this paper as a possibility you see.
But that was one of the first important applications in medicine to reattach detached retina, and I’m so pleased when people tell me their eyes have been cured that way. I realised it would be good in communications, but I didn’t think it would go on fibre optics, I didn’t think about fibre optics, I knew it would be very god for communication but fibre optics …";145;Future Research
And you are still doing science and actually using lasers in astronomy?;Charles H. Townes: Yes, that’s right. I’m doing astronomy now. I frequently, I’ve changed my fields from time to time whenever a field becomes very popular and a lot of people doing it I think well, they don’t need me any more, I’d rather do something that’s being missed. I like to do things that I think are being missed and, so I’ve gone into astronomy particularly in infrared astronomy, which was not a well developed field, and now I’m trying to get a microscope on the sky in infrared wavelengths using two telescopes that are separated, now I have three telescopes, and for detection we use lasers for detection and then we also use lasers to control the telescopes very accurately. To do this for telescopes have to be very, very stationary, very accurately controlled, and lasers can do that, so lasers have made that work practical.;145;Motivation
And you are looking at the black holes in the centre of the galaxy for example?;Charles H. Townes: Yes, that’s one thing I did, I looked for black holes in the centre of the galaxy and we discovered a black hole, it’s about three million times as heavy as the sun, a black hole in the centre of our own galaxy. But right now I’m looking at stars and watching their behaviour. We can see them in so much detail, we can see a lot of things that the stars are doing and all along see them change with time.;145;Research
You read Russian scientific journals in Russian?;Charles H. Townes: I studied Russian and I knew some Russian, but the Russian journals were frequently translated into English. So, we could read them in English too. But I met these two Russians at a meeting in England, an international meeting, on spectroscopy and microwave spectroscopy and so on, and they were there, and they gave a talk about the possibility of a maser. They hadn’t yet made one, but we’d already made one and apparently they didn’t realise it! And we had a good discussion, it was very … and particularly just walking on the streets we could talk, they couldn’t talk when other people were around very much, they had to be careful because it was a restriction by the Russian government I guess, but as we walked along the streets we could talk very freely and I’d had a very good time discussing the situation with them. That was the first time I met them.;145;Research
So that’s why you studied French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian?;Charles H. Townes: Yes, I studied languages. I like languages and so I’ve studied languages and I thought it was important to know Russian because very few people in the United States did know Russian and we were in contact with them. But I enjoy languages.;145;Personal Characteristics
I see, and you’re also enjoying music?;Charles H. Townes: Yes, that’s right, I’ve studied some voice and studied some music and I like to try many things.;145;Creativity
Are you still active in music?;Charles H. Townes: No, I’m not singing any more now. I think my voice has gotten a little rusty.;145;Creativity
Okay. I have one final question. I have read in your biography that religion was a part of your upbringing, and I’m curious to hear about your thoughts about on the ways in which scientific and religious thinking can converge?;"Charles H. Townes: Yes, well I am religiously oriented and I think it’s important, and furthermore I think science and religion will converge in the long run because both are trying to understand our universe. Science is trying to understand how our universe works, religion is basically trying to understand the purpose of the universe, the purpose and how it works must be related, and furthermore we really use all of our human talents to understand both of them. We have to make assumptions in science, they make assumptions or faith in religion and so on, and we use our religion, intuition and so on. So in the long run if we understand both well enough they are bound to converge.
They’ll come together I think.";145;Personal Characteristics
We sit here in lovely Lindau in the south of Bavaria and this is the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Nobelpreisträgertagungen in Lindau. And I have Professor Rudolf Mössbauer, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961. And I’m going to ask you as the first question. Could you tell us some parts of the story which led to you becoming a physicist?;"Rudolf Mössbauer: It’s a difficult story. First of all, I grew up right after the war, which was already some handicap. The story really was I had never seen a physicist in my life before I went to studies. That’s the first thing, and therefore I came from the mathematical side. And I had once a teacher for four months in my school in which mathematics was taught, and I suddenly got the idea this was useful. So I went to the university. Physics was the worst field in my school, simply because the teachers were no good. But I had the feeling there is more behind that than actually there was presented in school.
Therefore I went to the university. I enrolled in all four fields which were similar to each other, which were mathematics, which was engineering physics, which was pure physics and which was high school teaching. So it was not too much difference between the four fields. It was only at the pre-diploma, which is roughly equivalent of the bachelor’s degree, in which I then clearly had the feeling I’m a physicist and nothing else. And I then decided to study pure physics and nothing else.";153;Life
So it means that if you start very young and you make some important discovery or invention you actually can have a new career?;Rudolf Mössbauer: Yes. I had a completely new career. I mean the neutrinos have nothing whatsoever to do with the old field of research on which I was engaged.;153;Creativity
But could we go back? I realise that it is asking you quite a lot to go back and to try to remember when you made this discovery, or the effect that has been given your name, the Mössbauer effect. Was there some special moments you remember?  Could you also say a little bit of what it is?;"Rudolf Mössbauer: What it is, is essentially … I learnt how to get rid of the so-called width of the gamma lines which I was using, which were at that time some ten orders of magnitude and now up to 15 orders of magnitude. You got rid in one step by incorporating the nuclei on which I was working, in solids rather than in gaseous form as most people had done before. So I got rid of the width of the lines immediately in one big step, and this of course opened a new area in which you could make many specialised experiments which were not possible before. That was it in essence. It’s like throwing a stone in a boat. If you throw the stone during the summer period, the majority of the energy is going into the stone but a small amount is going into the recoil. And it was this small amount which prevented the overlap of emission and absorption lines, which made it quite difficult to observe the effect in the old times.
They searched for nearly 40 years on this and they didn’t understand why it didn’t happen. The reason was simply this recoil phenomena. If you do the same experiment on the boat frozen into the lake during wintertime, then the whole lake takes up the energy, you have no recoil energy and the emission and the absorption lines are exactly on the same spot. And this is part of the story, but it’s an essential story, which tells you the emission and absorption line are exactly on the same energy and therefore you are in business.";153;Creativity
So then of course I have to ask you was this a trial and error discovery, or was this something that you sat down with a paper and pencil and thought about?;"Rudolf Mössbauer: No, it was really a trial and error discovery. First I should have gone to high temperatures. If I would have done that I would never have discovered the effect. But I went to low energy simply because I felt higher temperatures and lower temperatures were about the same phenomena; it was about the same size of the effect. So I felt it was easier to build a cryostat, which we called a cryostat, you wouldn’t call it today a cryostat, but it was at that time a cryostat. So I went to low temperatures and therefore I discovered the effect, because I always found the wrong sign. It was a very tiny cross-section measurement at that time.
Nowadays you do it by Doppler shift experiments, which I discovered also later on but after my thesis only, which is a factor of 100 higher so that’s easy to do. But at that time I did a cross-section measurement and it was an effect of ten to the minus four plus or minus three times ten to the minus five, which is nearly impossible today to make. Even today I did it with tube electronics rather than transistorised electronics. But you cannot do it today, because we make lots of correlations, and every correlation wipes out the effect and therefore the effects are, even to measure intensity change of one percent or point one percent today, is difficult. Point ten to the minus four with an error of three times and ten to the minus five is nearly impossible today.";153;Creativity
When you had understood that this had high potential for applications, did you yourself go into those applications?;"Rudolf Mössbauer: Yes. I went into the applications. I spent about, well, some years in chemistry, I spent some year in biology. These were the most important applications. You could really … Every field, whether it’s medicine or anything you can do today. But I realised, after having been then for five years Director of the neutron research reactor in Grenoble, that it was time to leave. Even nowadays, some 2,000 publications per year annually are being done, so it was hopeless. There were hundreds of laboratories which were involved in the kind of research, and largely working along hyperfine interactions. Isomer shifts, which is zero, M1s are magnetic dipole interactions and E2s are electric quadruple interactions. Most experiments are along these lines.
I even asked the Max Planck Institute at Heidelberg, where I have been doing my work at the beginning, to provide me with iron-57, because the majority of experiments, even nowadays, is done with iron-57 because there you can do it at room temperature already. By lowering the energy sufficiently well you can do it already at room temperature and ask them to provide me this isotope. But unfortunately they declined me. They declined us.";153;Creativity
It’s very interesting because I know several cases of people who have you know found something out and then have spent the rest of their life just applying you know what they found out. So my next question would be when you decided that it was time to lead the application of the Mössbauer effect, was the Nobel Prize in any way involved in that decision?;Rudolf Mössbauer: Actually not. I got the knowledge from receiving the Nobel Prize in 1961, through United Press, because I was in the West Coast in the States in California, and the East Coast was rather close, Stockholm was much further. So, but I had a very bad flu at that time. And we always had a flu each year for about one week. And it was really you felt all your liver and your intestinals you felt and you completely lost your voice.  You had to write to communicate by writing with your wife or with whoever took care of you, because after three days for three days it was completely lost, the voice. But then it came back and I already knew by then it was nothing dangerous. And I didn’t have any fever but I was in bed when I received the knowledge of the Nobel Prize and I didn’t care, I couldn’t care less then.;153;Impact of Nobel prize on you
And that change was the Nobel Prize … Did it have nothing to do with that?;Rudolf Mössbauer: No, it had nothing to do with that. It was simply it was a field in which I wanted to change to go to something else. But the Nobel Prize had nothing to do with that.;153;Impact of the Nobel on you
"No. That’s very interesting. Now, could I ask you also a question which we did not discuss before, but I mean you can say no if you want to? I mean you have worked in many places, I mean many laboratories, and also very different laboratories; some of the smaller, some of the bigger ones and so on. And you know there is a discussion about creative environments. Could you say something from your experience about …?";"Rudolf Mössbauer: I can only say my own experience. I was first working at Caltech, which was in solid state physics and there work very few people are together. Actually I was essentially alone. I had some students with me, but basically I was alone. If you are depending on machines, on big reactors, or any at Grenoble, it was a big installation. But the bigger installations where I really did experiments of my own was … first of all we started in the neutrino work at Grenoble. We could get very close to the fuel element. We got to within five metres. But I could move, I could move the experiment, therefore we left Grenoble. And then we went to Switzerland and went to Goesgen. It was a pure electrical station but it was a power reactor. I stayed outside. Fortunately, I measured the distance between. The closest distance was 38 metres, the furthest distance was I think 64 metres if I remember, and we had in-between another position. So we did experiments there.
We had a group of maybe ten people. It was a lot of fights. I then went to the Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy. And we had about 50 people there and I though the fights are continuing and they are getting worse. It was not the case. It was very quiet there and we had no fights whatsoever between ourselves. Simply because we had young people, very young people, at Goesgen in Switzerland and they were very ambitious. We had older people in the Gran Sasso Laboratory and they were not so ambitious. You could just say you didn’t understand that and they didn’t bother about this, while the young ones would bother about this. And therefore we had about 50 people all together in the Gran Sasso Laboratory and it was peaceful.";153;Creativity
That was very interesting. I mean you say that if you have more grown-up scientists then sort of the general feeling is more peaceful. But a question about creativity. I mean would you say that the peaceful environment would give more new ideas or would that be the other environment where we have the young?;"Rudolf Mössbauer: It didn’t matter so much. Of course with the younger people you get more fights and they have also strange ideas. I make maybe a remark myself: I think it’s the young people who make the progress in physics. If you consider all the major discoveries, most major discoveries, not all of them but most have been made by people under 30. There’s no question about that. And the older you get the more knowledge you acquire, but the least your temptation is to get into new fields. You just know too much. You know the reason for this and for that and for that, why it doesn’t work.
For instance, when I was a young fellow I remember I had a paper in my hands, which I mentioned before, in which Steinwedel and Jensen were the ones. Jensen got later on the Nobel Prize also himself for another area. And he had proven mathematically that it was impossible to find what I had found later in Heidelberg some 40 years back. But he had proven it mathematically, but I was too stupid to understand it. And that’s why I think young people, who are more likely to try something which is unconventional which older ones wouldn’t try because they know too much, are making the progress in physics.";153;Environment
We are now in Lindau, a small town in southern Germany, and this is the celebration, the 50th anniversary of the Nobelprizeträgertagungen and I am here with Professor Donald Glaser. Professor Glaser could you tell us a little bit why did you become physicist?;"Donald Glaser: As a child I was always interested in mechanical things and I built model airplanes and radios and circuits and so on. At the age of eight I tried to read about relativity because everybody said you had to be very smart to know relativity, but I could not understand a word. But actually, when I came to high school and was getting ready to go to college I did not know the difference between science and engineering and my parents did not either. Nor did my teachers in high school, so I began in college as an engineering student and it took me about six weeks to figure out that that is not what I was interested in and that physics was really the key to fundamental understanding of the physical world. I found I was really fascinated by mathematics and physics and I could do it very well, so it was easy to make the decision to go in that direction.
There was a problem, which is that at first I had no idea of the difference between the level expected in high school and in college, so I got zero on the first physics exam. And then when I went to my professor and said I wanted to be a physicist he looked in the book, he said, ‘No you can’t be.’ He said that if you get a zero in an exam you can’t get an A in physics and you can’t be a physicist unless you get an A in physics. ‘But’ he said, ‘I’ll make you a deal. If you get 100 on every exam, even though it is illegal, I will give you an A.’ So that is what I did, I worked very hard.";154;Life
Eventually, if we go very quickly through your career, eventually you received the Nobel Prize in Physics. I know that this was for the invention of the bubble chamber. Could you say a little bit more about that? Could you say a little bit more about how one detected elementary particles before and how you came to the idea of the bubble chamber and how that was developed?;"Donald Glaser: As a result of my courses in graduate school at Caltech I became very much interested in the question of the fundamental particles; that is what is the universe made of and how do they interact to explain the properties of things? That is what interested me. I did a thesis in cosmic ray research which was the really only way to study particles produced by very high energy collisions in that time. That was in 1947-48. Using cloud chambers we could get one interesting picture a day. An interesting picture was one which showed a thing called a V particle and we had no idea what that was, but it was clearly something mysterious. Now we call them strange particles for complicated theoretical reasons, and with a slide rule I could compute the relativistic parameters of each picture before I had the next picture, so everything was well matched. But the number of facts that we could gather was much too small to get any theoretical insight and there was an enormous variety with huge errors.
There are a number of very funny things that happened, people would claim they discovered a new particle, and then Hans Bethe, professor at Cornell, also a Nobel Prize winner, calculated that when a particle goes through a cloud chamber it gets scattered by hitting gas molecules so that you can get almost any mass at all. Therefore, none of these particles meant anything. In fact there was a group in Armenia that published a paper saying there was a thing called a veritron, and a veritron was a particle that could have any mass. It was really nonsense, so things were in bad shape and so I set myself the task of trying to figure out a way to increase the rate of collecting data. The main method at the time was the so called high pressure cloud chamber which was a box with gas at about 20 atmospheres and every time you expanded the chamber there was an enormous bang and then you could not do it again for about a half hour. Because the thermodynamics required a long time for stability in order to get straight tracks, so that did not seem like a very good solution. At that time already people were using various kinds of counters with the accelerators, but the cloud chamber really was not very useful with the accelerator, because the accelerator could produce a beam of high energy particles every 5 seconds typically, and the cloud chamber just could not keep up with that.
Anyway, I did not want to work with accelerators. In those days at least I had the ideal that a scientist was a lone individual who thought very hard and focussed on a particular … It was not the idea of a big group of people. In those days the groups were not very big, but I decided what I wanted to do was make a detector that I could put on top of a mountain in cosmic rays in splendid isolation and discover new particles. That was the dream. I asked myself, ‘Well how can you do that?’ The main idea obviously is what you want is a transparent medium in which you can see tracks and which has high density. The ideal thing would have been a transparent lead brick … You can’t have a transparent lead brick, so I began to think what can you do with glass? What can you do with liquids? What can you do with crystals? I had the idea that … This is a cotton shirt but many shirts in those days were made of Dacron. And the monomer of Dacron I think is acrylonitrile which is soluble in. I do not remember, alcohol, water, forgotten. When it is polymerised to make Dacron it becomes insoluble. The fantasy I had was that a particle would come crashing into a big glass vessel filled with acrylonitrile and it would make whatever it is going to do, a spray of particles, and they would turn into Dacron and then I would fish it out and it would be like a Christmas tree and I would measure it. That was the dream. It turns out that I did not get any Christmas trees, but instead the solution gradually became brown. It was an excellent dosimeter, but it was not a particle detector.";154;Creativity
… it was special. That was a very special story you told us and I think that we are very grateful for that. For me the really mysterious thing is now you have told us something which clearly shows that you did something, you enjoyed it, it was fascinating to be in the library, with the journal, in the laboratory at night and at the Cosmotron and so on. But I know that since you received the Nobel Prize you have started doing something else. Could you tell us why a little bit?;"Donald Glaser: It is very easy. As I mentioned I was hoping that I would sit by myself on a mountain and discover particles. But it turned out that this gadget, the bubble chamber, was ideal for the accelerators and so I was trapped, I had to work with accelerators, and so I did and I took car loads of students and equipment and so on. But I did not like that, and finally the last paper that I contributed to, there were 23 authors and we had to go to Geneva to agree on the final draft because we had so many pictures that I sent them to many countries and so then there were Italians and Germans and so on, everybody, so we had to come together to agree, because maybe we used different standards of measurement and so on. And I could see that that was the trend and it used to be until then that if I had an idea that I was excited about, a whim, an impulse, I could go to the lab and collect my students and try to persuade them that this was worth doing and we could start on it a few days later. But in high energy physics you had to submit things to committee after committee after committee and so you become essentially a combination politician-administrator in which the science part is a very small part.
In a way the Nobel Prize set me free because I knew they would not fire me if I did not publish something for two or three years. That allowed me to go into molecular biology, which had always interested me, because when I was a graduate student at Caltech was the time that Max Delbrück and others were doing their very exciting work, really working out what molecular genetics was. In those days physicists could do that. Because it was mostly a question of being very clever about combinatorics and logic and so on. And it did not require much skill or knowledge of chemistry, either. I wanted to do that and when I got my degree I went to Delbrück who was a tough character, a nice man but very strict. I told him I had been enjoying his seminars and he had seen me around. I said: “Could I be a post doc in your lab?” and he said: “What’s the matter, can’t you get a job in physics?” I was so frightened that I went away and then some years later we became friends, he invited me to teach a course with him on theoretical biology at Caltech. So I went into molecular biology, quite seriously, and worked on, mostly on control and repair of DNA synthesis in bacteria and also in mammalian cells. I suppose the most important thing to come out of that was a study of zero derma pigmentosum which assessed skin cancer, that people are very vulnerable to, who are deficient in repair mechanisms for damage caused by ultraviolet light. Such people can live completely normal lives if they stay out of the sun, so mostly they sleep during the day and they go out at night. But it is known now that there are seven enzymes, and we need not talk about, but the mechanism is now well known and I was not the only one, many people working on it. But we worked on it at some length.
Then at a certain moment some friends approached me and said: “You know, a lot is known about DNA but it has not done humanity any good.” We formed the first biotech company, I did it with a couple of friends, and also I had students in molecular biology that could not get interesting jobs and that was another reason for starting it. I had two kids and I was concerned about graduate school for them, so there were many motives, financial and otherwise. That was a very exciting time. One of our consultants was Ham Smith who was here at this meeting, so we became good friends. That was a very exciting time, but it had the disadvantage that it industrialised molecular biology and also molecular biology became to be more and more biochemistry. I am not good at biochemistry. I do not enjoy it probably because I am not good at it, so I quit. I continued with the things that our little company … I was chief, chairman of the Science Advisory Committee, but I did not have any real business responsibility. That is when I went into neurobiology, which is what I work on now.";154;Career Devleopment
It was very special I think, so I think we should thank you very much. Is there something more you would like to say to young people around the world?;"Donald Glaser: Sure, I mean the usual advice which I believe very seriously, is that in picking a profession or having picked a profession, to pick a particular subject, you should try very hard to find one that you really are interested in. Because whatever you do it is going to be very difficult and it is going to take a lot of persistence and if you have to force yourself to do it, you will not be as good at it. It is not good to say: “I am going to suffer for 20 years and then I will finally have the answer.” But you have to enjoy the process within reason and be very very interested in it. That is the idealistic advice. The realistic advice is you also have to ask can you earn an honest living if you do this? That is tougher and it is much harder now than it was after the Second World War where there were many opportunities and even academic jobs were very easy to get. When I got my degree I had five offers from different universities and I had done a respectable thesis, but not heroic, and it was pretty easy.
The problem is, and now it is unfortunate, but the result of the difficulty in finding a good job makes the students very conservative. They want to end up, quite reasonably, as a certified expert in some field which is in demand. If you say: “Hey, I have this idea and it is really exciting if we can do this” they are not willing to gamble, and you can’t blame them. The same thing happens with assistant professors. Until you have tenure you have to be conservative in order to survive, so only the most courageous risk takers can be lucky enough to do something which is far out. By the time you are an associate professor you can’t stay up till midnight every night. Everybody here has been talking about your people are most creative before they are 30. Well, part of the reason is that before you are 30 you have a lot more energy and endurance and it takes hard work and concentration and a very good memory for the mistakes you made. But I tend to forget some of the mistakes I made, which I did not used to do, so I think there are good biological reasons why you do better … What I think is needed is something they have been doing at Harvard for some time, which is called I think a junior fellowship. Anyway, what it amounts to is roughly a five-year appointment with a guarantee of no evaluation, no reports, nothing, until the end of the five years. I think that one of the political speakers on the first day spoke of a thing like that. I think that is really a very very important thing. Because it still will be risk taking. A student will still have to try something, say, “Well I have five years in which to do this wild idea and if it works it is wonderful.” But as whoever supposes, if it does not work, you end up teaching school in a small provincial town, which is a bit severe, but anyway my advice to students is to make some kind of a trade-off. But they know that. They do not need us to give them advice.";154;Advice for young researchers
You were awarded the prize for overturning what was thought to be one of the fundamental laws of physics. You showed that there was not parity in weakened directions of elementary particles, which as I understand it basically means that you showed that elementary particles possess a handedness, that they possess the property of being either right or left handed. Is it still the case that people can do work that changes one’s view of the fundamental laws of physics or has that time passed?;Tsung-Dao Lee: I would hope it’s still true. We are constantly, as we struggle against nature the challenge is never diminished of our understanding and lead us to a further puzzle.;161;Roles of Science
So from the experimental front you set the parameters for the experiments that needed to be done in your theoretical work and then there was no technological barrier?;Tsung-Dao Lee: Wu’s experiment was not the easiest experiment, but it was a sure bet that they would test the idea. And that requires low temperature so took a few months. And it’s a 100% effect. So there is no doubt about the accuracy. But once it’s known then within a few days there are more than a dozen experiments. And people did that. And then within a month there are nearly 100 experiments. So the accuracy of the theoretical idea to nature can be verified without any doubt within a short time and that also made it easier for the Nobel committee to make a decision. So that perhaps explains.;161;Creativity
Again it begs the question what is it that causes a couple of people in their early 30s to challenge such an accepted tenant? I meant your age. What was it that caused you to challenge this?;Tsung-Dao Lee: I think that one was the behaviour of what one called the strange particles. This was from cosmic radiation. It’s called the Theta-Tau Puzzle. It may be too long to explain. Anyway there was a puzzle and it was two particles. Obviously they are different because they have different parity. They have the same lifetime. And they have the same mass. So why should there be a doubler.;161;Creativity
Let’s talk about those early years now. So you were born in China and what sparked your interest in physics? Where did that come from?;Tsung-Dao Lee: I grew up in a family of learning. But then in 1941, it’s really after Pearl Harbour, then I left my home, my father’s home. And then I did not know the physics. Zero idea. So therefore from there, before I went to the US, my education was totally interrupted from second in the high school … six year of middle school and then after that you go to college. So I had four years and then I left home so that was interrupted. Then during the war I had two years of college later. But in that period of course I tried to learn things in an unorganised way. So therefore I tend to think in my own way more so.;161;Motivation
But without formal instruction in how to read physics how did you teach yourself to work with the maths involved?;"Tsung-Dao Lee: Maths is easy because that follows … you take the beginning and you get the end. That is easy. You see. physics is much more … I can give my own reaction because I remember it vividly. Accidentally I saw one book was by Tuff. American. I think it was college physics. And the other was a Chinese book. This was accidental. And then I learned there were Newton’s three laws. I thought that’s very interesting. There are laws of nature. Then there are three laws. The first you know everyone knows. And I looked at that and say this is very good. There must be something in it. First law and third law. I said that seems to be very reasonable. It was the second law that I had … But in the book that’s Newton’s greatest contribution. /- – -/
Now my own reaction is still very vivid in my mind. On the left hand side you have f which you don’t know what it is. The right hand side you have acceleration which you want to find out. So what kind of law is that? The left hand side you don’t know. The right hand you want to find out. So I thought and thought and I looked at the book and I realised that there are two cases. Newton realised the force is a function of space. And he knew the function. One was elasticity. It’s linear in the distance. And the other one is gravitation. So once the left hand side is a non-function of space and right hand side is acceleration. Then you can solve it to be right. I thought that’s interesting. But that was not the thing that was stated in the book and so this is my approach.";161;Motivation
How old were you when you were having these thoughts?;Tsung-Dao Lee: I was 16. In China is where we’re fortunate, if you had no formal education during the war years, you could take what they call equal ability which is much harder, but if you perform well then you can enter college. So I had two years of college and then I got a fellowship for graduate studies in Chicago and then I studied under Fermi and then once you get that you are alright.;161;Creativity
Were you satisfied with the physics education that you received at university given that you’d approached it in this novel way and you hadn’t come out of some formal training system? You were training yourself and then you stepped into a formal environment of university, did you find that pleasurably, did you like what you found at university?;Tsung-Dao Lee: I was very fortunate because I was allowed to, even though this was during the war years, I actually entered two different universities. First year, the second year was different because the war. The first year I didn’t finish and everybody had to move. The second one was in Kunming. But in both places I was treated very nice. The second year I was a second year student but I could go to any classroom I wanted to provided I took exams. So I actually tried to cross the whole college so that’s why I got the fellowship for graduate student school in the US.;161;Motivation
How was Fermi as a supervisor? What was he like to work with?;Tsung-Dao Lee: He took very few students. Because I was his theory student. And he would have each week we spent one afternoon with us just talking, the two of us.;161;Mentors (Role models)
You say you were his theory student. Did he have one theoretical student at a time?;Tsung-Dao Lee: At that time when I was his student he only had one theory student. He had other experimental students. You see that is very time consuming. He spent an afternoon each week. He was at the zenus of his career.;161;Mentor(Role Models)
Did you feel a great burden that you had to prepare for each of these afternoon sessions?;Tsung-Dao Lee: He had what I would call and later I realised a tremendous technique. You see he said there are things I would like to know. He called me Lee because Tsung-Dao was much too difficult. Lee, why don’t you look up and give me a lecture next week. He was preparing something. I was very happy to teach Fermi. Of course this is an excellent way of building the student confidence and then he would ask questions and I would have to answer. Everything has to be proved just like that and why the reason. Later I realised that this was a fantastic effort of Fermi’s part. Personally guiding. To transfer his knowledge to build up the young man’s confidence. I mean this was a phenomenal thing. this is why Fermi produced so many good students.;161;Creativity
And he died in -54 so you did know him for some time after you have finished your PhD. Did you keep an association during that time or did you go your own way?;Tsung-Dao Lee: I passed through Chicago and I visited him. And he was also invited to other places. Looking back, I felt much more. Being young it’s like the children where you have parents who are that good to you but the realisation of the depth usually come even stronger years after that.;161;Mentors (Role models)
Yes he died very young. The things you learnt from him about the way you should treat students is that something you’ve carried on in your own teaching career?;Tsung-Dao Lee: I try. Also I maintain with my PhD student … I always spend similar, whole afternoon, talking. And different people you do slightly different things.;161;Mentors (Role models)
What do you hope you can give your students?;Tsung-Dao Lee: You try to give part of your love for physics and the way that you do things to a younger generation. And this of course is on top of that we teach. And the teaching is to a much bigger class.;161;Advice for young researchers
Do you manage to have small interactions?;Tsung-Dao Lee: I am now not at university because of my age so teaching I’m not doing. But I have colleagues which work together.;161;Creativity

Where did your passion for science come from?;"Pierre Agostini: I think research is the thing that attracted me to science because before that I didn’t have such an interest. Experiments; doing experiments and trying to find something that was not predicted, I think that’s the most interesting thing in science.";3;Motivation
How do you maintain your curiosity?;Pierre Agostini: Reading and keeping eyes open, I guess. Curiosity is something that is built in. I think I always was curious, and I will be always.;3;Creativity
Was there someone who inspired you?;Pierre Agostini: Probably Cohen-Tannoudji. In the seventies, we went to the College de France to his lectures, and he really excited me a lot.

Maybe you did something wrong, in the experiment it’s very easy to do things wrong. I think, just try again because it’s very rare that things work the first time. I have one experiment back in -79 that worked the first time, but this is usually not the case. We have to try again.;3;Creativity
What would you say to a student who has experienced a big failure?;Pierre Agostini: Big failure, OK. This happens all the time. A big failure as an experimentalist is something very easy to achieve. The important thing is to understand why this happens and just try to fix the problem. That’s the way I react at least. Most of the time you find two or three things which could have gone wrong, and you fix one after the other and usually that works.;3;Creativity
Do you ever get imposter syndrome?;Pierre Agostini: I try not to, but sometimes I guess it happens, not perhaps the last few years because I was really established in this attosecond business. I feel this is hope – but in the past, perhaps it happened. The way professional research works, you really do things that you’re supposed to do and, I think I have always felt at home with that kind of work. When you are not exactly sure what experiments to do and you try one and it’s not that great, then you really think ‘what am I doing here’ maybe. ‘This is not where I should be’. I remember when, I guess in the seventies, I went for a post-doc, or sort of post-doc in Los Angeles. But before that, I was doing experiments that were not working very well, and I was wondering if this is really the work I should do. Fortunately, this changed with time.;3;Creativity
What good advice have you received?;Pierre Agostini: Try to understand what you do, at least in as far as possible. Try to do theory also with experiment, and not just experiment.;3;Environment
What qualities does a successful scientist need?;Pierre Agostini: I have known a number of people who are wonderful scientists and physicists, and they have qualities that I’m afraid I don’t have. I think about, Harm Muller, my old colleague from Amsterdam and from the FOM-Institute who has absolutely wonderful qualities – both an extraordinary theoretician and fantastic in the lab too. He is the example I would cite for anyone wants to do science.;3;Competencies
What is your best quality?;Pierre Agostini: It’s difficult to define in a single word, but I would say precision and being aware of things. I remember once we had a glass setup in the lab. It had to be heated to a gas to purify the atmosphere inside. Once we were heating that thing, and I forgot about it and we went for lunch, and when we came back, that thing was melting. It was horrible! I was there, you know, it was all my fault. This is not being aware of things. From that time, I think I’ve tried to be aware of things.;3;Competencies
How do you spend your free time?;Pierre Agostini: Now I have some free time. I read most of the time, that’s what I do. I mean literature – American, novels, mostly fiction, for example, Glück, Louise Glück.;3;Free time
Does reading make you a better scientist?;Pierre Agostini: Probably, because there are a lot of things in the literature that could make me a better person. I don’t think it has made me a better scientist, though.;3;Creativity
Is keeping up to date with scientific literature essential?;Pierre Agostini: Yes, because it’s something necessary. You cannot avoid that. That’s part of the job.;3;Creativity
Where does your passion for science come from?;Ferenc Krausz: It always fascinated me to enter into a world which is not known to humans, and where we have the chance to discover new things. In general and in particular I have always been fascinated by the microcosm, by the very small things where we can look into and can get access to only by some very special tools like microscopes in space, and like very short pulses in time. I wouldn’t say there was a very decisive moment, a special moment, it was more due to a really excellent teacher in primary school who taught physics and who actually managed to present not just formulas, but also the whole concept of physics, how it works, and how it strives for explaining a whole range of phenomena with a theory as simply as possible. Kind of reduce everything down to the simplest level and try to develop concepts and theories with which we can explain and understand the broadest range of phenomena. This very concept was very fascinating to me, and probably that’s why eventually I decided to devote my life to this area.;4;Motivation
Do you think you would be where you are without that teacher?;Ferenc Krausz: Probably not. I think he really made a very decisive influence on my path. He directed my attention to a field where I had the feeling that I have the chance to just have joy when doing work and where I can go day by day to my workplace and do things which I don’t feel like work, but which feel like passion. That’s, I think to a large extent I have to thank to him.;4;Mentors (Role models)
How did you find out that you had been awarded the prize?;Ferenc Krausz: I was indeed working at home just doing the last touches on some slides. We had this kind of open-door day at our institute. This was a bank holiday in Germany, the third of October, and we opened our institute to the public. I offered to volunteer a few lab tours for interested people, and just thought that, well, just to introduce this lab tour it’s always nice to say a few words about what we are doing and what those complicated instruments are being used for. I was just about to do the final touches on these slides. It was very interesting because then I was just done, and I thought, oh, okay, I still have a few more minutes, and I can maybe take a look at the interview of Katalin Karikó, who was announced just the day before to be one of the winners of the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine. She comes from the same country as myself, so I just started watching that very brief video when the call came in.;4;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What was your response to the prize?;"Ferenc Krausz: Wow, it was overwhelming. I arrived there a couple of minutes after the prize was announced, and it was amazing how quickly people figured out and when I was arriving in the institute, obviously, they just knew about it and just got to learn about this. They were already smiling and were taking photographs; it was a very special feeling. It was an overwhelming feeling to celebrate these first moments together with people interested in science, not necessarily my own colleagues. Some colleagues came in shortly thereafter as well, which was also very special, of course, to celebrate with them. But it was also beautiful to celebrate just with the public, and then they see how excited they are and wanted to take pictures together with me. It was really a great feeling.";4;Impact of the Nobel on you
Why is collaboration so important in science?;Ferenc Krausz: I think these days technology altogether becomes so complicated, so sophisticated that to make complicated experiments work, we have to bring together a lot of bits and pieces from different areas, of not only physics, but also electrical engineering, information technologies, sometimes also life sciences. This of course relies on knowledge from many different fields which cannot possibly be brought in by just one or two persons. That’s why it was very important also in our field, also in our projects, to bring together scientists, often from different laboratories, to contribute basically their knowledge and their know-how to the project. This was also the case when we managed to generate and measure the first and the second pulse in Vienna. This was also the result of a truly international collaboration where scientists from Germany, from Hungary, Austria, of course, because this was in Austria, and Canada, were participating and were making contributions.;4;Creativity
Why is it important that science is an international discipline?;Ferenc Krausz: I think science is just inherently international. There is, at least in natural sciences, there is certainly no national science. I mean, the laws of nature are not restricted to a country, not even to a continent, but they are inherently international. I think that’s one of the truly beautiful things about science. That’s also what I think makes science so special and so valuable. Not just for spawning new knowledge, but also to connect people, connect people from different areas coming from different cultures, have them talk to each other, get to learn each other, get to learn each other’s culture and different habits. I think science can actually contribute a lot to a peaceful world.;4;Roles of Science
What inspired you to support scientists displaced by the war in Ukraine?;"Ferenc Krausz: I have been spending significant fraction of my time in Hungary over the past few years, thanks to a new project which we started there about four years ago. This was also the case, I was also regularly in Budapest at that time when the war broke out. Hungary is a direct neighbour of Ukraine, we have a common border. In the first weeks, month of the war 10-15,000 people crossed the border day by day. I’ve seen the pictures of it, it was televised of course, there were daily reports about what’s going on there. I felt very, very sorry for these people, and I wanted to do something, and I thought, wow, I should go there and volunteer kind of some help there, but I quickly figured out that my countrymen do a great job there, so probably I could do just an infinitesimal contribution. What else could I possibly do, which could be more than just an infinitesimal contribution? That’s how the idea about founding an organisation named Science for People came about and utilise basically my worldwide network and connections to other organisations and colleagues working at other research institutions to sensitise them for what’s happening here. Because I found that the farther away one is from a conflict the less is one affected somehow emotionally because the farther one is away the less news can be heard about even a serious conflict.
I just wanted to set up this network to sensitise people and collect donations for allowing us to help not the refugees that left the country, because they were taking care of really very generously in different European countries, but those very many who stayed in Ukraine, and particularly the children who stayed there, who have been suffering ever since the beginning of this war. Many of them are deprived of their schools, meanwhile, either because the school is destroyed or because they due to continuous shelling – it’s very dangerous to just go even out and go to school. Many have the only chance to learn by online schooling. We thought we should try to provide some help, and that’s why we teamed up with an organisation in Western Ukraine, and together with them we provide support to children and young people in their education and also for their free time activities.";4;Motivation
How have the countries in which you have lived influenced your life?;Ferenc Krausz: I do feel myself in the very first place as Hungarian, for sure. I was born there and I got my education there, so I owe a lot to my teachers in Hungary who directed my attention to this field, which I have been devoting my life to, and therefore for sure Hungary has a very big importance in my life. On the other hand, I have to say that I owe a lot also to Austria, where I had the chance to work with a great deal of degrees of freedom on problems and on challenges that I personally found extremely exciting, and where I had the chance to actually decide, yes, this is the direction I want to go. Particularly thanks to one person, to my mentor, Arnold Schmidt, who allowed me to really build a great team at the technical University of Vienna. Eventually, I have to thank a lot to Germany, where I had the chance to bring the kind of tools that we developed in Vienna to fruition and really utilise these tools for tackling a number of problems and demonstrate the kind of power of these tools and technologies of attosecond science. In this way also a bit fertilises other groups and “infect” other people in the world with this passion for this field.;4;Life
What advice would you give to young researchers?;Ferenc Krausz: I think what is very important for everyone is to find his or her right questions to find those questions where the search for the answer makes someone feel passionate about what he or she’s doing. It may be often quite difficult to find the right question. I think this is something that everyone, particularly those who decide to become a researcher, become a scientist, should spend sufficient time on to find their right questions, because that’s from which one can actually derive the goals and that’s what defines the tasks to be tackled on a short run – next few weeks, month, years, and beyond.;4;Advice for young scientists
How do you deal with failure?;Ferenc Krausz: Science, indeed research, particularly research at the forefront consists to a large extent of failures, probably more failures than successful steps forward. Of course, in the first moment, a failure never feels nice, but in the second moment, we do realise that there is a lot to learn from those failures. In quite a few cases, we can learn more from failures than from successive steps forward. I think we always have to see how we can extract the maximum amount of new information we can possibly get from that failure and equipped with that new information think what is the right step to be taken next? It is not a particular advice to be given in the case of a failure, I think it’s more how to deal with a failure. I think that’s what is most important: to make a failure feel not being a failure, but an experience from which we can gain new knowledge, and with this new knowledge, we have a better chance to succeed now, in the next step.;4;Creativity
What qualities are necessary to be a successful scientist?;Ferenc Krausz: Curiosity in the first place, almost equally importantly, perseverance, and almost equally importantly interest in finding something which no one else has found before. I think these three things together probably can make anyone a good scientist and can give anyone the feeling that work is not really work but joy and passion.;4;Competencies
What role does hard work play in research?;Ferenc Krausz: I think science is not special in that respect, probably in most other areas of life if you meet a challenge, a serious challenge, and want to achieve something by overcoming that challenge, by overcoming all the hurdles, then there is no alternative to working hard. That’s not special to science, I think, that’s an absolutely necessary ingredient. But just as I mentioned before, if the other three qualities are in place, then this so-called hard work doesn’t feel like work. That’s how I think about this.;4;Creativity
Is creativity necessary to be a scientist?;Ferenc Krausz: I would say it’s probably very helpful. It’s very helpful. But this is of course something that cannot really be learned at school, that has to come together in a problem or has to develop in a more sophisticated way by being interested in new things and being curious and being eager to figure out things which other do not know yet.;4;Creativity
What environments best encourage creativity?;Ferenc Krausz: There are environments, I could mention as an example our environment in Munich. It’s a truly fantastic environment where many scientific fields are around, really on a world class level. I think it is a great privilege to be allowed to work in an environment where no matter what kind of question is coming up there is an expert almost next door to be asked. Definitely, there are places where many disciplines are present and are being represented at a world class level. These are, I think, the best environments for creating new knowledge.;4;Environment
Why is diversity in science important?;Ferenc Krausz: I think science is the inherent platform which provides space for diversity and not just provide space but actually inherently encourages, because science doesn’t select, wow, this new knowledge that we need here, or new idea that will bring us forward, whether it comes from women or men or a person from one area of the world or the other area, it doesn’t make any difference, right? The main thing is that this idea, this new thought, is coming in and makes things move forward. I think science just inherently encourages people of any kind, irrespective of religion of culture – just come in and make a contribution.;4;Diversity in Science
How do you like to spend your free time outside of science?;Ferenc Krausz: What is that? [Laughs] No, this was a joke. I try to use my free time to switch off because I feel that switching off what one is doing most of the time is important to be eager to return next day and do it with full power and full motivation. Switching off can happen by being together with my children previously since a while with my grandchildren meanwhile. It can also be by sports. I do run a lot, I feel that is not only important for maintaining physical fitness, but also for mental fitness is very useful. I very much like reading, not necessarily scientific literature. I do read scientific literature as well, but in my free time I like reading completely different things.;4;Free time
Do you think these hobbies make you a better scientist?;Ferenc Krausz: I think we shouldn’t have hobbies to make us a better scientist, but probably if we can afford to have some hobbies and in this way we can recreate our creativity and our passion for science and our eagerness to create new knowledge, then probably this does help to make us a better scientist as well.;4;Creativity
What inspired your passion for science?;Anne L’Huillier: I don’t know exactly, it’s a very long time ago, but I was very much inspired by my grandfather on my mother’s side, who was a researcher and teacher in radio. During the World War II, he was working with the resistance movement, and he was helping them with communication. I don’t remember him very much because he died when I was four, but his story has inspired me very much, and he wrote many books that were at home. It inspires me. Then there is also something that I remember very clearly that was important for me, to watch the people walking on the moon. This was middle of the night, I was 10-year-old and it was very impressive. This I remember, and it kind of motivated me to go towards science and technique.;5;Motivation
What do you enjoy about science?;Anne L’Huillier: I enjoy doing research because you learn new things all the time. This I like very much. I also enjoy teaching science, teaching young people. These both aspects, learning new things and teaching others, that motivates me very much.;5;Motivation
Was there a teacher or a mentor that really influenced your scientific career?;Anne L’Huillier: Yes, several teachers have definitely influenced my scientific career, a mathematics professor at high school and then a little bit later, when I studied at university, very good teachers in physics, in especially atomic physics, inspired me very much, so I think that’s very important. I am thinking of Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and Serge Haroche and both got Nobel Prizes afterwards. They inspired me in their way of teaching, which is quite rigorous, but very pedagogical, and also to do both maybe experiment and theory. This little bit French school inspired me in my way to be a researcher and teacher.;5;Mentors (Role models)
How do you want your students to see you as a teacher?;Anne L’Huillier: This I don’t know. I just would like them to become enthusiastic with what I am teaching them, with the physics. This is maybe my motivation. Of course, they should learn, but they should also become like what they hear and become interested and enthusiastic. This is my aim.;5;Mentors (Role models)
How did you feel when you found out about the award?;Anne L’Huillier: When I received the telephone call not very much because at that time, I was struggling between what should I do, because I had my class waiting for me after the paus, and the Nobel Committee and the Nobel organisation were asking me to stay on the phone. I was a little bit struggling, what should I do? Then I said, No, I want to go back to my class. I agreed with them that I would finish the class 15 minutes earlier so that I could be part of the press conference. This is what I did, but they agreed to that. I think the whole thing with students became very, very nice and it just happened like that. That is nothing we planned obviously. This was very nice because somehow these students – and it was many students, about a hundred – became part of my Nobel Prize, if you see what I mean. The day afterwards, I also had a lecture. I started lecturing as usual, but then during the pause, again they came with an enormous flower … What is that in English? Flower bouquet, and they said, You have gotten many flowers, but we hope this is the largest. And it actually was. It was so nice from them, it was very, very touching, so for me the student response to that is going to stay in my memory forever.;5;How to Spend the Nobel money
Do you think it’s important that science is an international discipline?;Anne L’Huillier: Yes, it is. Absolutely and it’s remarkable that the oldest three physics laureates, we have all moved. For me, it’s from France to Sweden, and my colleague Pierre Agostini from France to the United States, Ferenc Krausz, it’s Hungary, Austria, Germany. This really shows that science is international and open, and I think this is extremely important. I think it influenced my life very much. I cannot really say what is the difference compared to if I had stayed, but to move country in general is making your life kind of richer. For me, it was a difficult decision on the professional point of view when I moved. But in the end, it became so good in looking at the facit. It was a very good decision, even on professional point of view, to move. I would encourage the young people not to be afraid to do that.;5;Diversity in sicence
When failure strikes, what do you do to move forward?;Anne L’Huillier: When you fail, it’s about being obstinate and to continue. This is a quality that you need to have if you want to do research, to be obstinate and to never give up. That’s essential.;5;Creativity
What advice do you give to your students about failure?;Anne L’Huillier: I’m just trying to tell them that the normal thing is failure. It’s not, success it is failure. I’m trying to show them examples and I guess this is how it is, but at the same time, I’m trying to motivate them and to say, Okay, but maybe this did not completely fail, you have this result that still is the coming through. There is nothing black and white, so even if something’s not exactly what you want, but maybe this is also interesting. That’s what I’m trying to do.;5;Creativity
How do you support the students in your lab?;Anne L’Huillier: First of all, the way we do research in my group, it’s never one student on a project. It’s always a group of students. The basic idea is that the little bit senior PhD student is teaching the junior PhD students. I’m trying to … so that everyone does not feel inadequate. For example, the first year you are a PhD student, I’m telling the student I don’t have any expectation from you, just learn, try to learn how it works. I don’t expect any result, just learn how things work. I’m trying to reduce the pressure on all of the students so that they feel that they learn and they come up to speed and try to make them feel good.;5;Advice for young researchers
What advice would you give to a student or young researcher?;Anne L’Huillier: This is a difficult question. I’m going to answer a little bit differently. What I’m trying to get from my students is actually a motivation from them. I think that a successful scientist, whether it’s in academia or industry, should have the motivation by himself or herself. This is what I’m trying to get from the students, that they are motivated for what they’re doing. This needs a little bit of time and care, so I’m not, I’m never pressing my students for example to work more, it should come from themselves. So that’s the idea.;5;Advice for young scientists
What qualities make a good scientist?;Anne L’Huillier: I think you, again, you need to be motivated and to be a little bit passionate, I think that’s important. I think you need to be obstinate, it is also very important, not to give up because something fails or because you don’t know where it’s going. Then I think for me science is not only working with machines and gas or lasers, it’s working with people. To build up a good research group and to have a good relation with your colleagues and the students. This is also very important. Finally, I believe that in communication, teaching and research goes hand in hand. I think it’s important that the researcher can teach what they are doing and this communication with students is important.;5;Competencies
What skill has been particularly important to your career?;Anne L’Huillier: This is the thing I like to use, and that’s the word intuition. To be a scientist is about following my intuition. I think for me, to follow my intuition has been something I have done the whole life without having real reasons or a scientific reason, maybe from when I was a child. Why did I do science? Maybe I was motivated, but I followed my intuition. This is maybe a little bit with this obstination, why I was obstinate to do that. I followed my intuition. Why did I continue to look at harmonic generation although my boss at the time was telling me, Oh, you should do something else, this is not leading anywhere. It’s not that I had a vision that, Oh, it’ll lead to attosecond pulses, or, This is very interesting. It’s not, because I was not finished with doing research, and I was following my intuition. This is something I would like to tell the young people: follow your intuition in life.;5;Competencies
Do you prefer research or teaching?;Anne L’Huillier: I like both, it depends a little bit. I like research very much, but I like teaching very much, I could not do only one. Moving from France to Sweden also meant that I changed from a research institute with no teaching to a university with teaching, and this was a discovery. It was really wow, so fun it is to teach. I think it’s about communication, to communicate your enthusiasm to students, and it could be also to other researchers. This is something I like to do very much. Research of course requires all the skill, which is to go to the depths of something, to be able to analyze new experiments in the right way, to have ideas – maybe when you see something a bit new, different, to realize that this might be important. Research of course requires different skills.;5;Mentors (Role models)
Why is diversity in science important?;Anne L’Huillier: I think it’s very important. First of all I would like to stress that very often new ideas don’t come. Of course, you can have your own ideas that pop up, but very often it’s a group, it’s within a group discussion. You have people discussing, and then someone says something and another one get an idea and say something, a third person is kind of putting two things together. Often, and I have seen that many times, it’s a group discussion, and the more diverse this group is, the better. I’m coming to diversity here. I think here, it’s nice if you have people with different backgrounds that contribute to this process, with different educations and different backgrounds. Then when you do research, to have a good atmosphere in the group is extremely important. I think it is always better if you have a diverse group with people coming from different countries, different genders. This really helps to have a more dynamical group where people are happy to be in that group and to contribute and to do great research. So there I think diversity is important.;5;Diversity in Science
How do you like to spend your free time?;Anne L’Huillier: First, I work quite a lot, I can say that. What I’m doing in my free time is I am doing some tennis. I’m trying to get active. This is now, but a few years ago, I was at the family, my sons, at home, To have a family and, and taking care of the family was a big free time activity. I think to be a good teacher and scientist, you need to have a good balanced life. I don’t really believe in scientists just working all the time or sitting in the attic and just working. I think this is an image you find in books. I think it’s good to have a balanced life with a family, with a little bit of free time activities.;5;Free time
Are there certain environments that you think encourage creative thinking?;Anne L’Huillier: Yes, absolutely. This is what I’ve been trying to describe. You need to have a good social atmosphere in the research group and good discussions where people dare to express what they think, even if it’s maybe stupid, but then they express what they say, and no one is telling them, No, no, this is wrong. You need to have this freedom in the research group, and this is where creativity can come.;5;Environment
How do you maintain your own creativity?;Anne L’Huillier: This is a good question. For me, creativity is associated to interest and passion. If what we are doing is do we have new results that we need to understand, and it seems really interesting and fun to understand these results – this is where creativity is coming. For me, as long as I feel that what I’m doing is fascinating, interesting, I think I will still have a little bit of creativity to do research. I think this is the case for everyone. It’s not like you are creative, it’s like, Oh, this is very interesting, fascinating, I want to understand. This is where creativity is coming. That’s my interpretation.;5;Creativity
Where does your passion for science come from?;Alain Aspect: When I was a kid, I lived in a small village in France. At that time it was very rural, so there were not so many technical objects, but I was fascinated by any tool from the carpenter, from people like that. I don’t know why, but I was really always fascinated by technical objects. Then I was a reader of Jules Verne. Jules Verne is an inspiration or more, it was confirming what we were learning. Remember it was in the fifties and the sixties, it was after the war, and there were the ideas of progress. There is one book of Jules Verne L’Île mystérieuse, ‘The mysterious island’, where engineers and scientists arrive on an isolated island, and because they have the knowledge of science and technology, they will be able to develop a comfortable civilisation. That was a belief that science is good for humankind.;6;Motivation
Are you still a reader?;Alain Aspect: Oh, yes. Sometimes, for the pleasure, I go into one of these old books.;6;Career Development
What made you decide to pursue science?;Alain Aspect: I think really since elementary school, I was attracted towards scientific “things”, because at elementary school it’s very simple. Anytime the teacher was doing a little “experiment”, I was always interested by that. Then I went to high school, and it turned out that at that time, for four years in high school, there was math, and natural science, biology, but there was nothing about physics and chemistry for four years, and I felt frustrated. I was waiting for the moment when I would learn physics and chemistry, so I think I was always fascinated by it. What happened then? In the last year of high school, I had a fantastic teacher at the high school who really determined my life, because he taught me what is the approach of physics. That is to say a blend between pragmatism, but also solid mathematical model, and at each time finding the simplest possible model, but anyway, it must be sophisticated enough to render an account of the phenomena. This is really a high school teacher who taught me that.;6;Motivation
When did you know you wanted to pursue quantum mechanics?;Alain Aspect: Well, I smiled because the story is interesting. I had excellent studies, excellent courses at university except for quantum physics. Seeing it from now, clearly it was a very bad teaching. The professor did not understand what was really quantum physics. I had that frustration, I knew that it was important, and I knew that I did not know it well. What happened that while I was in Africa, in Cameroon, for military service – okay, I was teaching rather than going to the army – I had the opportunity to buy a book by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Nobel Laureate in 1997, Bernard Diu and Frank Laloe, and I learned quantum physics into that book, and then I understood what it was about. When I came back to France and found a paper by John Bell, which determines our experiments, I was ready to appreciate the paper by John Bell.;6;Motivation
What does it take to proceed in science without support from others?;Alain Aspect: When you are teaching, it’s a different world, so for me, the week was cut in two parts. There was the part dedicated to building that experiment and making tests and progressing in the development of the experiment that I was doing. On the other hand, there was teaching. Teaching is very rewarding because if you feel that the students understand what you are explaining, that they’re making progress, really it makes you happy. I think the fact that I was teaching was crucial for me. Teachers are very important. I mean, the fact that we have a future scientist depends on teacher and elementary school teachers, high school teachers.;6;Advice  for young scientists
What advice would you give to a student interested in science?;Alain Aspect: More generally, my advice would be follow your taste. Don’t listen to fashion, because maybe nowadays they tell you that this is a fashionable subject, but five years from now, it’ll be another one, so I think you should really work in what you are interested. It may be basic science, it may be technology. It must be application – it just depends on the person. Each person is able to know exactly what is his or her passion, and this is what they should follow.;6;Advice for young researchers
How do you like to spend your free time?;Alain Aspect: What can I say? It depends on the moment in my life. When I was younger, I was spending a lot of time in sport, hiking, playing tennis, etc. When you get old you are not as fitted for doing so much sport, so what do I do? Cooking, I like cooking. I also like rehearsing for magic tricks. Since I got mandatory retirement I thought I had some free time, and I started learning to do magic with cards. I’m not an excellent magician, I know some classical tricks, but when I do these tricks, rather than saying the usual words of a magician, I pretend that it is quantum. So, when a car jumps from here to my hand, I say, Oh, this quantum tunneling effect. I spend some time doing that, and of course, spending time with the family, my wife, grandchildren, my children.;6;Free time
Are there any similarities between quantum physics and magic tricks?;Alain Aspect: Not at all. Because magic tricks, really if you want to do well a magic trick, it has to become automatic, like riding a bicycle. Your fingers work independently of you, and then you can think about a speech, which has nothing to do with what you are doing. You can pretend that it is quantum physics because your fingers work without thinking of them. It’s certainly not like an experiment, because in an experiment, each time you turn a knob, you have to think about what you are doing, and observe and react.;6;Research
What environments help with creativity?;Alain Aspect: I need to have apparatus and knobs to turn. So, for instance when I cook, there is something which is very special, l’oeuf parfait, perfect egg. It has to be cooked at 64 ºC, not 62, not 66. I like to have a thermometer and to tune the heating, etc. Probably it reminds me of doing an experiment, adjusting everything in real time – observing, reacting, tuning.;6;Environment
Can you tell us about the object that you are donating to the Nobel Prize Museum?;Alain Aspect: The original thing in my experiment is the fact that the experiment is about two photons traveling to detectors. The idea is to change the setting of the detector while the photons are traveling. This takes only one or two dozen of nanoseconds, so it has to be very fast, and you cannot rotate an object in a few nanoseconds. My idea was to have a switch, and the switch would send the light either towards a first apparatus or towards a second apparatus. If the switch was fast enough it would be equivalent to a single apparatus operators rotating from one position to the other one, etc. These was my initial idea, I had published it from the beginning, and a company had promised to deliver the switch. In fact, the switch was my idea. It was based on the interaction of light with an acoustic standing wave. A company had promised to deliver it, but I wanted it big enough. After some time the company said, We cannot deliver it because so big we cannot we cannot make it, it’s too big. The reason was that when there were sticking a transducer on a crystal, it has to be done at high temperature, and then because a dilation is different between the material, it was breaking all the time. The problem was a contact between the material and the transducer. I was in despair because I needed that. I began to think, and when you are despaired, you become creative. Suddenly I realised that I did not need a crystal, water turns out to be a good material for that. If I have transducers in water, no problem of different dilation, there will be no breaking, so we built homemade – and the object I come is really homemade – it’s like, I don’t know how you say, in French a bricolage, one thing which is not a nice object, but it worked!;6;Donation to Nobel
What about the future of quantum mechanics excites you?;Alain Aspect: In fact, what is exciting in the last, say decade or decades, is the fact that smart people discovered that entanglement can be used for applications and this whole world of quantum technologies. The idea that maybe we have a quantum computer or quantum simulator, which is able to solve problems that we don’t know how to solve with our usual computers. I think this is very exciting because when you have been working in fundamental science and suddenly somebody comes and say, You know, your pair of entangled photons can be useful for something, I like this idea. This idea of quantum computer, I think that they can be fantastic. We have problems of optimisation, for instance, now we have wind electricity, solar electricity, and the equilibration of the electric grid is a very complicated problem. It’s so complicated that you cannot find the solution with a standard computer because it’s called a difficult problem, a problem for which the time of computing increases exponentially with a number of elements to adjust. It may well be that quantum computers can help solve this kind of problem. Not only this one of course, but this kind of problem. To be honest, I would be excited to see that.;6;Future Research
Do you ever think about your professional legacy?;Alain Aspect: Oh no, but I can think about it. I think that if there is something I would like to teach is curiosity. When something interests you, just go into it and try to understand better and better. Don’t listen to people who tell you it’s not interesting. If you find it interesting, just continue in it.;6;Mentors (Role models)
What do you think about people saying that you proved Einstein wrong?;Alain Aspect: Often people say that my experiment showed Einstein wrong. I think it’s not fair at all, because what happened is that Einstein raised a problem and his vision of the world was such that he came to the conclusion that one must complete quantum theory and Niels Bohr disagreed with him. The experiments we have been doing in test of Bell’s inequality show that quantum mechanics cannot be completed along the lines that probably Einstein had in mind. From this point of view, it’s true that he was not fully right, but he did not know about our experiments. In his time he could think that his interpretation was compatible with standard physics, so we don’t know what he would’ve said. Moreover, I told you that entanglement is a very important property who put the finger on entanglement and said, Ah, this is really amazing. It is Einstein. So, when people say, Oh, you showed Einstein wrong, I say, Come on, I showed Einstein was great, and if he had known what we have today, nobody knows what he would’ve said.;6;Dealing with difficulties
Where does your passion for science come from?;"John Clauser: Oh, I think that’s very clear. My dad was a scientist and when I was a kid, he was a professor, in fact chairman, indeed the creator of the Aeronautics Department of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. I would add, all of my primary life leading up to this, every question I asked he would answer in detail very patiently with me, and I just soaked it all up. Then when I was in high school, I would take the bus up from Baltimore Polytechnic in Baltimore and walk across the campus to his office where I was supposed to be doing my homework waiting for when he would drive us home. Instead, I would just wander all over the campus into all various laboratories, into his laboratory and I would walk in and look at all these marvellous pieces of devices sitting around and say, Boy, when I grow up, I want to be a scientist. Look at the great toys you get to play with.
I’ve just been bathed in it since I was a very young kid. I loved science, my dad taught me lots of it. I was a high school whiz kid in electronics, built a whole bunch of computer science projects, even won a few national affairs, and I was just having fun. My parents left me as a free-range kid, I could do pretty much anything I wanted and did, wandered all over the city. One of the things that I enjoyed, I was a member of a high school radio club, went out and just built a lot of electronics and I was having a blast doing it all.";7;Motivation
When did you know you wanted to pursue quantum mechanics?;John Clauser: When I went to Caltech, originally I was thinking about electrical engineering, but very quickly realised, No, I think I want to do physics. Caltech was a marvellous place, some of the greatest physicists in the world wandered the halls there. Very quickly got enamoured with doing physics, and all of which I was just having fun. I enjoyed doing a lot of it. I was not as good a student as I probably could have been. I was the social chairman of our residence house, the Dabney house at Caltech. Threw some great parties and flunked out a bunch of freshmen who really weren’t going anywhere anyway, so probably the best thing for them. Somehow – I have no idea how – I got into graduate school at Columbia. There I was working on my thesis project, on the cosmic microwave background. Originally we were going to put a radio telescope in a U2 high-flying U2 apparatus, where I learned a little bit about the spectrum of water vapor in the atmosphere that could relative to climate change. We ended up not doing that, ended up looking at interstellar cyanide and making the third measurement of the microwave background.;7;Motivation
Would you consider yourself to be a good student;John Clauser: In order to I get your degree at Columbia, there were, I think, five important courses you had to get a b or better, otherwise you were considered having flunked. Quantum mechanics, I had flunked twice. I think finally my Nobel Lecture will explain why I flunked – what was driving me nuts and why I still don’t understand quantum mechanics.;7;Career Devleopment
What was the reaction people had to your theories?;John Clauser: Much to the distress of my thesis advisor, in fact, much of the distress of the whole Columbia physics faculty, everybody told me I was totally nuts in doing this. Everybody knew that Einstein was wrong, that he was getting senile was frequently the claim, and that Bohr had it all right. I couldn’t understand Bohr at all. Then I ran across John Bell’s paper, and that started my whole career in studying quantum mechanics. That was while I was still a graduate student. Columbia had more physics Nobel Laureates than I think Caltech did. They all told me, You’re nuts doing this. When I was doing the experiment at Cal Berkeley my dad, who was then on the physics faculty, he was Dean of Applied Science and Engineering at Caltech, and I would go home to Pasadena for Christmas and his birthday and Thanksgiving and whatever, so I was down there for Christmas. Then he said, Oh, I have made an appointment for you to talk to Richard Feynman. Oh, okay. I was doing the experiment, so I walked into Feynman’s office, and he threw me back out instantly. He was actually angry, as best I could tell that I was a challenge doing an experiment to test the predictions of quantum mechanics. Everybody knows predictions of quantum mechanics are perfect, don’t even need to look. I think his line was, if you find something wrong with the prediction of quantum mechanics, you can come back then and we’ll talk and figure out what your problem was, or what your problem is, and dismissed me immediately. He was rather abrupt.;7;Creativity
Did you find people who supported your work? How did you do so?;John Clauser: When I was at Cal Berkeley trying to do the experiments, the really only two people, or maybe three later on, that thought it was actually a good idea, Charlie Townes, he is a Nobel Laureate, of course, and Howard Shugart was a great atomic physicists there, fortunately allowed me to stay there for I guess from 1969–76, where I did like four different experiments. I had a great time. I was having fun even though I had destroyed my hero Einstein’s work. I was not very happy about that, but that’s what the data kept telling me. I got to report what I see, that’s what experimental science is all about. Literally you’re talking to God, and God has spoken. It was not easy getting into a position to do the experiment, absolutely not, I had to struggle to do that. It was only through the kindness and generosity of Townes and Shugart that I stayed on.;7;Creativity
What was the hardest part of getting people to pay attention to your work?;John Clauser: The hard part was getting around this, this was a religion among physicists, and in fact even in the Bohr-Einstein debates, and with Schrödinger also, the universal religion was quantum mechanics makes correct predictions, period, no, off the table. What Bell’s theorem and in particular our version of it, the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt experimental prediction, showed that either that had to be wrong, nor Einstein’s whole legacy had to be wrong. I think at the time people who were critical of doing the experiment didn’t realise really what was at stake, that it was that cut and dried between two religious icons, if you will, the field of physics. Since I kind of was the inventor of the CHSH inequality and the CH inequality and all that, I knew exactly what it was all about. But it took a long time for that to filter in.;7;Creativity
What advice would you give to a student or young researcher?;John Clauser: If you’re not enjoying it, find something else that you are enjoying and then you can put your heart into it and really be good at it. Totally silly to waste your time if you’re not enjoying what you’re doing.;7;Advice for young scientists
How do you see science? Why do you think science is so special?;"John Clauser: Okay, to start out with, I’m an atheist, for that point of view. But literally when you go into – at least I feel this way – when you go into a physics laboratory, you’re talking to God. It’s like going into a church, asking a question of God. It’s not often that people will walk into a church and say, All right, God, what’s the mass of an electron? But nonetheless, if you ask a question carefully, you’ll get a definite answer. It’s an unusual church from that point of view. If somebody else asks the same question and walks into another church he or she will get exactly the same answer. Find me another church for which that is true, that two people could walk into different churches, ask the same question and get the same answer. Enough said.
Nature is beautiful. There is great majesty in all of the natural patterns. You probably heard the comment about to look on Maxwell’s equations is to look on the work of God. There is great beauty in the symmetries that are built in, and if you’re the first guy to see something new, some new patterns in nature that nobody has noticed before, it’s an awesome experience, realising that you’re the only person in the whole world who knows this, and you have communed with nature as no one else has in the past. It’s a truly marvellous feeling, it gives you a great spiritual feeling.";7;Motivation
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?;John Clauser: One of the things that my dad did that helped me along was taught me to be sceptical of everything, especially other people’s interpretations of experiments. He would say, Okay, go back and look at the original data, if you possibly can. What was really done and be sceptical that they have drawn the right conclusions. And I do that to this day on everything. I am the world’s worst critic of pseudoscientific claims.;7;Competencies
What has sailing taught you as a scientist?;John Clauser: I’ve raced across the Pacific Ocean any number of times, and you learn a lot about clouds. I was using solar power for the instrument systems, and I was just sitting there in my berth watching, and I had an air meter on the solar panels and watched every time we go under a cloud, the total current charging their batteries would drop to one half. Why is that? Almost exactly one half every and in and out of clouds, flick, flick, flick, flick goes the needle. Amazing. It gave me a whole different opinion of how climate change works. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what makes sailboats go fast, how to win races, built a lot of hardware. The present boat the rudder that came on the boat was a total joke. It was slow, you couldn’t steer the boat, it had a lot of drag so I just tore it out and built a whole new one in my backyard with starting rolls of carbon fibre cloth and buckets of high-tech epoxy and boars of polyurethane foam and put the whole thing together. It was fun. I didn’t know how to do it to start with, but I taught myself along the way. It’s not that, doing the stress analysis is pretty straight. If you’re a physicist, it’s piece of cake. It’s just straightforward handbook engineering.;7;Motivation
Where does your passion for science come from?;Anton Zeilinger: My passion for science goes back very, very far. Even as a child, I wanted to know how things work, and I was also curious what happens. We lived in the countryside in a small castle, it was not private, it was after war, so the castle was free to be used. My father was working there, and I’m told that I was sitting up there on the second floor of the castle and watching out all the time, as a child, three, four or five years old. The people in the village thought that I’m kind of crazy, which maybe I am, you never know. This is how it started, and as I said, I was interested in how things work. I was usually not interested in putting them together. Many physicists try to put things together. As soon as you know how it works, why should you put it back together again? You know it already, right? It seems to be curiosity, and it seems to be curiosity for everything.;8;Motivation
Was there a single defining moment when you decided to pursue science?;Anton Zeilinger: I don’t think that there was a single moment which made me this decide to go for science. There were various inputs, like my father had given me a microscope when I was 14 years old, and I played with the microscope. I had a fantastic teacher in physics, in gymnasium, as we call it, high school, and at the time when the others in my class, the other boys, were talking about girls and all this, I had a friend and we were talking for hours about cosmology and about the big bang and this and that. This was curiosity.;8;Motivation
Was there a particular person who influenced you?;"Anton Zeilinger: My teacher in physics and mathematics, he was clearly excited about what he was telling us. That’s the most important ingredient in my eyes for a good teacher. He or she can make mistakes, and it doesn’t matter as long as the person is excited and you see that the whole soul is behind it. That’s enough. That’s it.
To be excited, you cannot fake. Young students, they know immediately what goes on in a teacher. They know it right away after 10 minutes. Let me make one point, another feature of a teacher is that the teacher has to take you as a person seriously. I had a teacher in another field who was very cynical and made jokes about us, but the fact that he made jokes meant that he took you seriously. That was a good teacher too. It is not fashionable today to say something like that, but you felt accepted and the teacher took you so serious that he even tried to make fun about you. At least that’s the way I saw it. The worst are teachers who don’t care. That happens unfortunately sometimes.";8;Mentors (Role models)
How do you cope with failure?;Anton Zeilinger: There was only one big failure. There was one experiment, about 2000, where we tried to do something which was too ambitious at that time. We spent a lot of money and the results we got were so complicated that we didn’t understand it, so we gave up. This was the only really big failure in my academic life, having been too ambitious in terms of … and with my students. But otherwise, you meet challenges. There are things which you did not expect, new problems, and you don’t know how to solve it right away. But this can all be attacked by essentially stamina. Keep going what you want to do, and most important, in my field, in experiments, talk with your students, your postdocs all the time. Discuss, and certainly somebody has an idea, and off we go.;8;Creativity
What was it like when you first started pursuing science?;Anton Zeilinger: I was very lucky, which I found out later, for having been educated in Vienna. Because in Vienna, you still had or still have a spirit of openness to very fundamental questions. The idea that something has to be useful is secondary in Viennese culture, and that was extremely useful for me, as I discovered when I came to the US. The second point is that I had my PhD thesis supervisor was doing experiments on the foundations, fundamental experiments which were unique at that time, there were maybe two or three others in the world, I didn’t realise how unique this was. I was lucky to work on that thing. It’s an intellectual environment, which is extremely important.;8;Creativity
How is science today different from when you first started? How can it be improved?;Anton Zeilinger: Not that common, and it gets worse. Now we have a development that when you want to get money, you have to say what it can be used for. 30 years ago, when journalists asked me what can this be used for, I said, I can probably tell you this is not good for anything. We just do it out of curiosity. It is very important that you have the possibility to do something out of curiosity. In today’s funding schemes, you’re always asked, what is it good for? You’re also asked, what methods will you use to do this? In the beginning, I had no idea how to realise the things I wanted to do. This came slowly, it took years. What to me is my most important experiment is entanglement of more than two particles. We had the idea in the late 1980s, and the realisation was in the late 1990s. My appeal is really that funding agencies, universities, and so on, should be much more open to really curiosity driven research with no application in mind. I will fight for that as long as I’m alive. Not for me, but for the young people. The young people need to be encouraged to do this kind of thing.;8;Creativity
What attitude do you need to be a successful scientist?;Anton Zeilinger: This attitude is playfulness, personally, and that also means that like myself, I never worried about my career. I never thought about what will I do? Where will I get a job? This was just not a theme. I worked on this kind of thing because I was curious and I enjoyed it, and the rest came. I think today there’s too much worry about what will happen and so on. I tell young people, if you find something where you are curious about where you are excited about, do it. Don’t listen to what your supervisor tells you, what other people tell you. Because if you are excited about it, you will always be better than the others who are not excited about it.;8;Competencies
How do you like to spend your free time?;"Anton Zeilinger: In my free time, I like to sail. I have a boat on the lake in Austria, and I love to just be on the boat. This is an old wooden boat, just to be on the boat and fix this or that. That’s already relaxing. Sailing, you stand the top. I also like to sail in the Mediterranean with the crew and so on. I think I know why sailing is so important for me. This is because when you are sailing, the complete mind is focused on just what happens on the boat and on the wind and on the waves and all this. There’s no possibility for your mind to go off and think about the usual daily problems or even the questions, what do you have to solve in science and so on. It takes your complete person, and that I think is a kind of recovery to get strengths and so on.
The second thing I like to do is to collect old maps and they collect old views, and with the maps, it’s a focus on political change, like a map of the Soviet Union is very interesting to look at today. A map of the British Empire is very interesting to look at. Even way back 100-200 years ago, the maps of Europe, like how big Sweden once was, for example. All these things are very instructive. It tells you in the end how unimportant some questions are. The name of my boat is 42, because this is taken from The Hitchhiker’s guide to the Galaxy. There was the question about life, the universe and everything, and the supercomputer produced the answer, which was 42. And my boat is the answer.";8;Free time
What was it like talking physics with the Dalai Lama?;Anton Zeilinger: I visited Dalai Lama twice, for a week in his residence in Northern India, and he went to my lab in Austria, and looked at the lab. He has a scientific mind, very clear scientific mind, and he asked the right questions. We talked about, on the one side, the basic statements of quantum physics, and on the other hand, he told us some of their philosophical findings. Not meditation and so on, but some of their philosophical findings, which are quite interesting. It was a very interesting discussion, it’s not written up yet, but at some day it has to be written up, what came out of it. What that actually tells me is there maybe are interesting parallels between Eastern philosophy and what we are doing, but I say maybe because some of these explanations are wisdom in hindsight. I told them, there were some leading Buddhist teachers and philosophers there also, and I told them when it is said that quantum mechanics has realised this or that, then I believe that under one challenge. Tell me one thing which we have not discovered yet, and I go to the lab and check it. This has not happened.;8;Impact of the Nobel on you
What about the future of quantum mechanics excites you?;Anton Zeilinger: The most important question is why quantum mechanics. Quantum physics is probably the most beautiful mathematical theory humanity ever invented, and it’s also the best proven. It’s incredible how precise the predictions are realised. But as John Clauser said in an interview recently, he doesn’t know what goes on, why do we have this? This is in my eyes one of the most important questions, and I think it has to do with what is the role of information versus reality, and there is something where we can make a breakthrough, I think, and I hope this will happen. I have some ideas about that, and I want to spend the rest of my life working on these questions.;8;Future Research
I wanted to start off by asking where your passion for science comes from?;Suki Manabe: I guess that when I was little, I really liked to look at the sky and daydream. I was interested in weather and the climate is sort of the average of weather. In a sense, I think my curiosity about weather and climate started when I was very little.;9;Motivation
Would you say that there was a particular person, a role model, a parent, or a teacher that encouraged this curiosity in some way?;I’m not sure, but I was a little bit of an unsociable kind of person. When I was in elementary school, I usually stayed at home, laid down and thought about something endlessly. I don’t think this is a good personal characteristic for some professions. But in my profession, it has been a very good personal trait, which I think has shaped my career as a research scientist. This personality, which is a shortcoming for most professions, has been good for me.;9;Mentor(Role Models)
Would you say that daydreaming about science is something that you still do?;That is right. I think about the same things day after day and I try to understand them but I can’t. I keep on day dreaming, thinking about the same things again and again and again. That has turned out to be a very important factor for my success as a scientist.;9;Career Devleopment
Is that something you would say is a quality that successful scientists need? What other qualities do you think you need to become a successful scientist?;I guess that one of the things is curiosity. You are curious about something and then you think about why this is happening. That is what happened to me with climate change, which I have been working with for the last six decades. It’s a long time. This turned out to be a very fun thing to think about because, as you know, daily weather is very interesting. Why is the climate changing? Why is the climate changing the way it does? And what is controlling that change? I have always been interested in climate change such as global warming. I am also interested in why the ice age happened and why the climate was so warm when dinosaurs were living on this planet. It looks as if carbon dioxide is one of the important factors. I have been doing this driven by curiosity: why is our climate changing the way it does? I think this also helped me in my career. I’m curious about it. I was doing it not because climate change is very important for human beings. I never had that slightest idea climate was going to be so important when I was studying it in the 1960s. I never had the slightest idea that climate change was going to be such an important factor for human beings. What drove me was pure curiosity.;9;Competencies
You’ve been working with the issue of climate change for six decades, what are your thoughts about climate change today? Do you have a message that you would like to share?;When we talk about current climate change, which we are right in the middle of, we mainly think about temperature. But what is happening now is that the temperature change on this planet has affected the global water cycle – distribution of precipitation, distribution of evaporation from the continent. It has a profound effect on the water cycle of this planet. That is one of the reasons why we get droughts more and more frequently. For example in the sub-Saharan region in Africa, Sahel, I think that this change, which is ongoing, is starting to have a profound effect on our daily lives. This is why climate change has become such an important phenomenon. What is happening is that we are burning fossil fuels at a tremendous speed. We are burning coal, which has accumulated over a few hundred million years, in a few centuries instead of a few hundred million years. That is why the climate is changing so rapidly and posing profound problems for us..;9;Future research (interests)
You are born in Japan but you have lived in the US for many years. How was that journey from Japan to the US?;You know, the Japanese people always worry about each other – they don’t want to hurt each other’s feelings. So for example, Japanese people don’t want to say no. So even though your answer is no, you try very hard to moderate the impact of saying no to another person listening to you. In science this is not a very good thing, you have to say very clearly you disagree with each other. Then you think about how we disagree. Why do we disagree? In order to tell him I’m right and to prove that I’m right, you have to do additional research. What is that research? The other person also thinks about why we disagree with each other in order to prove he is right. What kind of result do you have to present to prove you are right? So in a sense, by disagreeing, both gain greatly and make good progress to understand the problem which we are tackling. When I came to the US, I found out that people can disagree openly in public. I thought this was a great thing. Of course, Japanese people are trying to think about each other, and that’s wonderful and that’s why they are successful. We live together harmoniously because of this trait. But, in a sense, I like the way things are done in the US.;9;Environment
How do you think that we can encourage more women and more diversity in science?;"I think this is very important. Women are half of our population, right? I think female scientists, even though they are very capable of doing a great job and getting married and having children, many of them stop doing research at that point. What is very important is to have more daycare centers so that they can put their children in daycare. I think more countries should invest more money in daycare, it is very important. You could give financial support for families who have more children. I would like to have every country in the world do that; to put more emphasis on these activities.";9;Diversity in Science
How did you celebrate the news of the prize? How did you react when you got the news?;I have to say it was a big surprise because I never expected to receive it. It was a kind of shock to me and for five months after the announcement of the Nobel Prize, this news has gradually sunk in. Nobody doing the kind of work I was doing has got this prize. Almost everybody who got a prize got it for contributions for the advancement of modern physics, quantum mechanics and so forth. Nobody got this award for climate research before. But I am very grateful that the Swedish Academy of Sciences thought about giving me the prize. You know, I am 90 years old so at this age, I will die happily knowing that I got a Nobel Prize in Physics. It’s gradually sinking in and now finally I can relax and begin to think about reading a book which I never had the time to do before.;9;Impact of Nobel on you
You turned 90 years old last year, what life advice would you give to a young person?;"Looking back at the last six decades of my career, I really enjoyed what I was doing and being curious. I liked what I was doing and digging deeper and deeper. Sometimes it was just a struggle to get through but looking back, it is a nice memory. I have enjoyed my life exploring the secret of climate change. The most important reason is; I was doing what I like most and probably what I was best suited to doing, as I explained at the beginning. There is a saying that what one likes one does well, so I would like to have young people do what they like in their life. I think when young people do what they like they usually do well. When you get more and more involved you enjoy it more and dig deeper. I really recommend that young people do things that they like and have a great life.";9;Advice for young researchers
How do you like to spend your spare time?;To be honest with you, I spent a major fraction of my life thinking about the same thing. I really didn’t do much else. Now at 90, I finally decided to stop doing active research. What I’m thinking now is to read a book about something which I never had time to read, I was too busy all the time. One of the topics I’m reading is how this planet evolved during the last four and half billion years and how life evolved starting from phytoplankton. Then more animals started developing and then us human beings. That is one topic I’m interested in reading about. At night, sometimes I want to relax more. I’m looking for some books. My wife has many books written in Japanese so I think I will start reading some of those. That’s how I want to spend my life.;9;Free time
Could you tell us a bit about your childhood. Were you always interested in science even as a child?;Georgio Parisi: Yes, let’s say that. I do not have very precise memory but my mother tells me that when I was three years old, I was already able to read the numbers. The typical activity was that when we were waiting for the bus at the bus station I was able to read the number of the buses that were arriving. I think that is true – it’s what my mother tells me – and what I am certain of is that when I was at elementary school, I was very interested in astronomy. I was reading books for children on astronomy, popular books, I had an idea of the distance of the planets from the sun, more or less an idea of the diameters of the planets and so on. And at 10 years old I started to read science fiction.;11;Family/Home Environment
Was there a particular moment when you decided to become a physicist?;"I think that during high school I was interested in mathematics and physics, but I was reading mostly non-professional books. I was reading something on the history of mathematics, the history of physics. There was a particular book on the history of mathematics that I liked very much.
When I finished high school, I started to think what I should do at university. My father wanted to me to do engineering. I found that engineering maybe was not interesting enough. I knew that I was very good at mathematics, but I had no particular idea of what mathematics was doing at that moment. I mean, this is my reconstruction, but in the end I decided on physics.";11;Motivation
Was there a particular person, a teacher or role model, that influenced you in your early career?;Not, not too much. I think that when I was at high school, from up to 18 going to university, I did not speak to people about physics and mathematics. I think that I was not proactive in searching for them because I was satisfied by what I was doing. Sometimes I went to the library and read essentially articles in the encyclopedia, but I did not have any particularly contact [with anyone about it]. I would say the only person that did have an influence on me but in quite an indirect way was a friend of my family that had a microscope. They gave me a small microscope where I could see some very small animals, of a fraction of a millimeter and so on, that could not be seen by the naked eye. I spent a lot of time collecting dirty water, putting it on the microscope and looking at them. So I think that this was a positive influence in the idea that nature is interesting, that it’s surprising, that you can discover things and so on, but that was something that was not at all related to physics or to mathematics. In that way I was an autodidact.;11;Mentors (Role models)
Do you have any advice that you would give to a young researcher or young scientist just starting out in the field?;"My advice is to try to understand his or her own abilities, and what interests them most. It’s clear that interests may change, abilities may be cultivated, but have some ideas of what they feel they can contribute. For example, for someone that is good in doing programming, maybe it’s not worthwhile doing lot of computation by hand. Or for someone that very much likes to do experiments, it’s better to do experiments instead of theory. Try to understand their own qualities, try to cultivate their own qualities and also be confident, because sometimes confidence is very important. If you are confident that you can do something you will do it.
Let me tell you a small anecdote, if I may. There was one conjecture on spin glass that we were not able to prove. Then someone told me that they proved this conjecture and they explained the proof to me, which was relatively simple. So, I was speaking with a friend of mine and he started the conversation by saying, well, I think that we are never going to be able to prove that conjecture, that it is too difficult. I told him, “No, no, no, you are wrong. Those people proved the conjecture.” And he said, “Ah okay, I see the proof.” And he told me the proof! The point was that he had more or less the same background of these two other people. So when I told him that the other two people have solved the proof, knowing what the other two people knew, he realised that it should be possible to do the proof. In 10 seconds or something like that, he told me the proof. It was quite amazing.
So you see that if you have confidence, that in some sense anybody if they were told that they have the capacity to solve the problem would be able to solve it. Self-confidence is very important. Of course, it’s clear that you can’t exaggerate with self-confidence. But I think that self-confidence is an important ingredient.";11;Advice for young researchers
What do you like best about your work?;"Well, there are many things. I think that doing science is like playing puzzles or reading a detective story and trying to understand who is guilty before the author tells you. I think that most people like to play with puzzles but as a scientist I think this is on a different scale because the type of puzzles that we are interested in are on a much bigger scale. And what is important is that we don’t play by ourselves, it’s all of the scientific community trying to solve this puzzle. So we work together and this is an intellectual pleasure that is important.
Also, the other thing that I think is important is that sometimes when you understand something, you and your team are the only ones that know this particular thing and you want to communicate to other people. I think that is something that also gives you lot of satisfaction when you discover something or come to a conclusion about some phenomenon.";11;Motivation
And what do you enjoy doing outside of work?;"Well, it depends. These last two years have been somewhat difficult because, with COVID, a lot of activities were not possible. I always like to read books – novels, histories of science, science fiction and so on. For example, just in the last year, I read many things by Asimov, some of Asimov’s novels I’ve not read before. Also I read all of the Foundation Series in order, one after the other, which I always read in some random order and not contiguously. I very much like to go skiing, to the seaside, to do this kind of of activity outside. And, after 50, 55, I started to be strongly interested in traditional dance, for example, one that I like to dance is Greek dance. That is something that I like very much. I also do some couple dances, for example the one that I was doing before COVID was Forró, [a Brazilian dance].
Also I like walking. I am quite lucky that near to my house is a big villa, Villa Ada, which is I think two by three kilometers, something like that. So it’s large villa and I very much like to go there to walk.";11;Free time
Do you think it’s important to relax and have an outlet outside of work?;It’s clear that it is very important to relax. There’s always some kind of activity that in some way helps you to establish some good connection with your body in some sense… I mean, when you’re dancing, you have to pay attention to your body. It’s also good that there’s something that is very different from the usual thinking, if you have to think of the angle that you put the foot on the ground, if you have to think that before moving the foot on the ground I should move backwards a few centimeters in advance, I mean, it’s not necessary to do, but if you want to do with style, you should add such small movements and so on, concentrating all these kind of things. And also try to follow the music because you have to be on time. So all these activities they absorb you completely, and there are some kinds of activity that are completely different from what you do in your work so it’s very good for relaxing.;11;Creativity
And how have you found your time since you have been awarded the Nobel Prize?;One of the things I found most amazing was that in Italy usually in this period one walks in the street with masks. But even with a mask sometimes I find that people stop me or just pass nearby me and say congratulations professor. It was something that was quite amazing to be recognised in the street by people I’ve never met.;11;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Could you tell us a bit about when you were a child? Did you always want to go into science and be a scientist?;"Roger Penrose: I think science in some sense. Both my parents were medical and I was one of three brothers. I had a sister who came along a lot later, but for a long time I was just one of three. My parents had given up on my older brother. He was obviously going to be a physicist or something. My younger brother was obviously going to play chess. He became British chess champion a record ten times. So they decided I was going to be the one to carry on the medical profession. And I thought so too. We used to do tests and things and it came out that I was going to be a doctor.
I think it was when I was about 16 when we had to decide what we were going to do in the final two years at school. Each one had to go and talk to the headmaster. He said, “What do you want to do in your final two years?” And I think what I said was biology, chemistry, and mathematics. And he said, “No, you can’t do that combination. If you want to do mathematics, you can’t do biology. If you want to do biology, you can’t do mathematics, make your choice.”
At that stage, I had fallen in love with mathematics and so I said chemistry, physics, and mathematics. So that was my future completely changed from my medical career. When I went home, my parents were both very annoyed. They thought I had been keeping bad company.";12;Family/Home Environment
So your passion was mathematics. I understand, however, that you struggled with maths as a very young child?;"I think that’s a slight misunderstanding. I was slow. I was very slow and I was not quick at doing arithmetic. I remember particularly, when I was in Canada during the war years when I was about eight. The teacher there, she had little mental tests and you had to do a mental arithmetic – add seven, multiply by three, subtract four. I would simply lose track very quickly. She thought I was very stupid and decided to move me down. Finally, she got rid of me by moving me into high grade three. I think she just didn’t get on with me.
I did have a very understanding teacher a year or so later. He realised that I was just being very slow. He insightfully decided that he would allow me as long as I liked to do the test. I can remember looking out of the window and seeing people in the playground and I was still struggling with my test.
Then I did very well. It was really just that I used to have to work. I didn’t remember my tables very well – I had to work them out each time. I really wanted to know what was going on rather than just parroting what I’d been taught. I just didn’t remember these things. Whereas when I was allowed to think about it, then I did much better. So I think to say I was not good at mathematics is misleading.";12;Family/Home Environment
What was it about mathematics that particularly drew you to it?;"A lot of it was geometry. I remember in particular, again when I was in Canada, I don’t remember what age. There was, I think it was a sink top, which was tiled with regular hexagons. I asked my father: suppose this pattern went on and on and on and went all the way around the world, could it cover the whole world with that pattern? So he said, no, you can’t do that with hexagons, but you could do it with pentagons. And this was the dodecahedron. I spent a lot of time making models with my father. We used to make polyhedron or truncated ones and different kinds of polyhedra.
I think my father was a big influence on me. He was a scientist – he worked in human genetics, it wasn’t mathematic, but he definitely had a feeling for mathematics, particularly geometry. We used to talk a lot about that.";12;Family/Home Environment
Do you feel like your family environment – maybe you felt a bit competitive with your brothers – influenced you to take the path that you ended up going down?;Yes. I think it was not so much the competitive aspect – that was there but I don’t think that was what it was. It was more just the science for itself. I remember at one stage, my father, he had a telescope, which he liked to look at the sky and he showed me the rings of Saturn. And then, wow. I’d seen it in pictures but to see it’s real, out there, was something special.;12;Family/Home Environment
Is that when your interest in the universe started?;Yes. I think so. I think my father knew quite a lot of astronomy, but, of course there wasn’t much cosmology known at that time. I picked up a lot more of that later on.;12;Creativity
How important do you think bouncing ideas off your father was to you?;I think it was very important to me. It was strange because my brother certainly taught me a lot more specifically about physics. But it was particularly my relation with my father which developed these interests. He liked to play with things. There was no boundary between what he did for fun and what was his profession. He used to make puzzles for little children and things like that so he was very good in that way. It was partly also to do with his profession. I remember he made a very complicated slide rule, which had all sorts of conditions. You had to slide all these different rods together and then you went through to the bottom and you’ve got the diagnosis. It was very much playfulness on his part. So what with his serious profession and his playfulness there was no borderline between the two. I think that rubbed off on me very much.;12;Family/Home Environment
You have had a very long and successful career in science. What do you think you need to have or do in order to be a successful scientist?;"Admit you’re wrong when you are wrong, is one. That is important and I think a lot of people aren’t prepared to do that.
Gosh it’s very difficult. People are so different and often say to me what do you recommend? And I say, well it depends on you – do what excites you. Of course you might be going up the wrong track, but this happens a lot.
I would say generally do what excites you, not just what you think you should be doing. That’s certainly the factor with me. It’s difficult because you’ve got to earn a living after all. And it may be that you have to do something which isn’t quite what your ambition is. I don’t know whether that’s a very good moral always, but it seemed to work with me.";12;Competencies
I heard that you have a lot of blackboards around your house in case inspiration strikes. Are you always thinking and coming up with ideas?;"Always is not the correct statement, but I do have a blackboard. I can see it right where I’m sitting in the study. And I have a portable whiteboard, which I sometimes put behind me if I’m talking to somebody and they want to illustrate something on the board. And I have a whiteboard in the bedroom, which I should clean off actually, because it’s got something on there which keeps on distracting me when I look at it.
Sometimes I get an idea, which I forget you see. I remember the other day it wasn’t so long ago when I woke up in the night thinking I had an idea. I thought, ‘Oh, I’ll remember that idea for sure.’ I went to sleep, woke up the next morning and I thought ‘Didn’t I have an idea in the night which I was sure I would remember?’ So I had to go through very carefully to try and resurrect what that idea was. I think I did resurrect that one. I do keep a notebook within arm’s length when I’m in bed so I write something down. It doesn’t often happen.";12;Creativity
What do you do in your downtime? Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work?;"It’s difficult to find time for hobbies now because there’s so many things I’ve got to do. Particularly with a Nobel Prize there’s so many things that I was working on I’ve got to put on hold for a bit.
I don’t know which you call a hobby and which you’ve don’t… I do draw sometimes. I drew a Christmas card, which was developed from the tribar. It was an impossible object, but it was a different kind. So that was Christmas card I sent out to people.
There’s this thing called the campaign for drawing, which I haven’t done much for recently, but I used to. They wanted to have people who belong to it to draw pictures, which they would sell at auction. So I drew a diagram, it was close to the Christmas card one, which was not one I’d drawn before. And this was sold at the auction I think for nearly £2000. I was quite surprised. This was for a hospice, it was a charity.
I like doing things like that. My notebooks, particularly the old ones, are crowded with all sorts of weird looking drawings I used to do. I don’t know if surrealistic is that the right word, they’re all distorted forms of one kind or another.";12;Free time
You’ve written quite a few popular science books. Do you think it’s important to make your work accessible for other people? Do you find that you benefit from it as well?;Yes. I think that’s true. Both ways. Yes. I certainly have felt that it’s worth trying to get express ideas also visually, because as you say that’s a lot of the way I think. Most of the books I’ve written, all the illustrations I’ve drawn myself. So, in fact, most of my artwork as anything that’s published is in those illustrations in books.;12;Creativity
After a long scientific career, how does it feel to be a Nobel Laureate?;"That’s a tricky question. I used to think Nobel Laureates were other people. ‘The establishment’ kind of people. And that was not me. I did things outside the establishment. I hadn’t expected to get a Nobel Prize but a lot of people, my colleagues, friends of mine said, ‘Oh yes, no, you’re bound to get one.’ I didn’t think this. So it was a bit strange.
It’s difficult question because I certainly had attached the idea a bit more to the establishment and I think of myself not as part of the establishment, but the Nobel Prize makes one part of it in a sense, which is an interesting experience.
It is a bit surreal.";12;Impact of the Nobel on you
And finally, can we ask you what is your favourite thing about the universe?;"Everything. Oh gosh, now, that’s a tricky one. I think I like the way it fits in with general relativity. I would certainly say that. Quantum mechanics is amazing. The trouble is, as I keep saying, it’s not quite right. There will be something just as beautiful when we get it right which has to do with the collapse of the wave function. Quantum mechanics has this self-inconsistency about it. It’s what Schrödinger made this huge point about. That’s why he talked about his cat in the box. He just wanted to show the absurdity of his own equation that leads you to this absurdity.
General relativity I think I would have to say, but you see, there are a lot of observational things about the universe, which are amazing. It’s a very hard question to answer.
Let me put it more generally: the way the physical world ties in with mathematics. Not so much just general relativity. How you see when you get it right the mathematics fits with the physical world in such a beautiful way. Yes, that’s it.";12;Motivation
Could you tell us a bit about your childhood? Did you always want to be a scientist?;Reinhard Genzel: Well, let’s see. I started with archeology. I went to, what you call in Germany, a humanistic gymnasium. So nine years of Latin and six years of ancient Greek. Archeology seemed like a fascinating thing. But it became clear, maybe when I was 13 or 14, that the classic period which you read in the books about was more or less done. That’s not true actually, but at least it seemed like that to me. My father is a physicist and was also a director of a Max Planck Institute. So in that sense, I was very close to physics from the beginning and also to experimental physics. As soon as my father discovered that I was interested in experimental stuff we built a laboratory at home. A little bit of chemistry but then later on in our house, up in the attic, I built up a fairly sophisticated optical spectrograph with high voltage sparks so that you could excite molecules and atoms and then measure the light and so forth. So, it was pretty clear that this was an exciting thing and that I would want to study physics.;13;Family/Home Environment
Did you have any accidents with your experiments at home or were they always quite straightforward?;"That’s interesting that you ask that! Well, yes, actually. Of course if one is 15, one has friends and wants to show them these kinds of experiments. In one experiment we made bromium hydride. Bromium hydride at room temperature is just between a vapour and a liquid. So if you make the reaction to create that bromide hydride and then you cool it, you get a liquid which you can deal with. It’s extremely corrosive. What I had not realised at the end of the experiment was my cooling apparatus was full of the vapour. So at the end of the experiment, I brought this all into the bathroom to wash up. But I had not realised that I was basically spraying bromium hydride vapour against the walls. Two hours later, my mother came home and already at that time some of the tapestry came down!
So that was the chemistry disaster. The physics disaster – I told you that in order to basically generate a spectrum [from molecules or atoms] you would have a charge device. That’s called a Leiden bottle. So you make a device with an insulator and then you build up charge and then you let that charge go through the spark plug and that generates a 15 kilovolts spark. Of course the entire 15 kilovolts is already at the surface of the bottle. And one day as I was playing around with the spectrometer and then having my hands all over the place, boy, did I get the full 15 kilovolts!";13;Creativity
But neither of those were enough to put you off of science?;No, it was fine. Actually I should say most of my time at that age, I spent doing sports. It became very clear, very early on that I was good at throwing things. Initially I did handball and later on I went into track and field. In fact at age 16, which was the last two years of school, I really was very good. I was the best German javelin thrower and I managed to get into the ‘group B’ young future athlete group for the Munich Olympics. So we were training for the Munich Olympics. For the last few years in school, I spent typically three, four hours in every afternoon doing sports. Fortunately I was a good enough student so I could do that. But then, as I started studying physics at university, it was clear either you’re going to go this way or that way.;13;Motivation
You mentioned your father but were there any other people that influenced you on the scientific path you took?;"Absolutely. In retrospect now, I would say even more than my father, my real mentor of later years was Charlie Townes.
Townes was Nobel Laureate in ’64 in physics – he got his prize for the invention of the maser and the laser. He was then a very influential advisor to the American government for many years and then became provost of MIT. And then all of a sudden he decided he wanted to go back into research and moved across the country to Berkeley, to California, and started doing astronomy. I joined his group as a post-doc and that was just absolutely fantastic. I would say, if you look at the kind of style of research which I’ve been pursuing since that time, I really learned that with Townes.";13;Mentor(Role Models)
What was the major lesson that he taught you?;Well, lesson number one is to focus yourself on important questions. Don’t get lost in the forest of arbitrary questions. Focus on one thing or a few things, work hard and see how far you get. And then if you have success and other people start coming along and do the same thing – which is very typical, if you’re successful and many people start imitating – then leave the field. He would always do that. He would always stay in a given field for only a certain length of time. The laser was one of the examples. He did the maser, he wrote a very famous paper about the laser, but never got into laser research much because that was done by industry immediately. Hundreds of people were descending on that field and he said, okay, goodbye, I’m going now. I’ve listened to that advice a number of times where after a while – it’s good enough, let’s go on, let’s do something else. Do challenging things and try hard.;13;Mentors (Role models)
What qualities do you think are needed to be a successful scientist?;"Well, I think I wouldn’t generalise. I would say it depends on the field. Surely everyone would agree that with the exception of very, very few discoveries, intensity is the most important thing. A burning desire, a concentration. I’m really concentrated on something and I just don’t notice the world anymore. That’s the kind of thing that you need to really focus.
Hard work. I mean, that may not be true for all. It’s possible that we’ll find some examples of extremely successful work, which was done in a more casual way, although Einstein’s general relativity which is supposed to be one of these great strikes of the mind really wasn’t if you look at it. He struggled ten years after the theory of special relativity to get to the general theory. He made many mistakes, his math wasn’t good enough. He had to learn maths from mathematicians and other people were telling him what he was doing wrong. So it’s by no means something that came overnight.
Now there are examples of things that came very quickly. I guess this last 2020 Chemistry Prize, CRISPR, that is more like it. From what I learned from Emmanuelle [Charpentier] it was done in a relatively short period of time, and it was based on a good idea executed fairly rapidly.";13;Competencies
What advice would you give to a young person starting in science?;"I would say if you really want to become a successful research scientist, you must really want to do it. You have to really be willing to sacrifice. If I look at my successful colleagues overall, then all of these are 150% people, so to speak. They’re really going all the way out to do it.
And of course, luck – you have to be lucky.";13;Advice for young researchers
And what about mentors?;"Now the mentor business, that’s an interesting question. I would maintain that, as I did, having mentors is just absolutely fantastic because they can point you so easily in the right direction if you’re willing to learn.
In the US certainly I would say the idealistic style of research is one where you are independent. I was never independent. I was building independence over the years, but I’m not independent now – I depend on my team. I wouldn’t have done anything without my team.
So I have to really say, you can want to get into a position where you can realise your dreams, maybe that type of independence. But to say, ‘I want to control everything by myself and not depend on other people.’ No, no, no.";13;Mentors (Role models)
You are very passionate about science, but what do you do outside of work in your free time?;I mentioned sports and, while I do not do professional sports, for a long time, until three years ago when I damaged my knee, I was intensely going into the mountains. Here in Europe in the Alps. And then in the United States, where I live two months a year in Berkeley, I go into Sierra Nevada. Mountains are great to hike in and relax for me. I’m not a beach person. My family is, they love to be at the beach. I don’t, I find that boring. But mountains, they’re great. And I mentioned archeology. Archeology you can still see when you come to our house. You’ll find hundreds and hundreds of books. I live in a library!;13;Free time
What is it about the universe and about your work that you enjoy?;"I tell people the universe and astronomy in particular is a bit like hiking into a new forest you’ve never seen. So you go into the forest, you hike and you enjoy, and you look around, you see the trees, see some flowers. So that’s the first phase is just to enjoy the richness of the universe. That’s what I would call astronomy. That’s not enough for me because, I now have learned [there are] trees and flowers, but I have not understood how this forest works. So the physicist in me, he now sees that the blue flowers are always on the left side of the trail and the red flowers are always on the right side of the trail.
And then of course you go ahead and you start doing experiments, you ask yourself, does it have anything to do with the direction, is it up or down, or how the water’s running? So you’re trying to learn about the universe through asking ever more questions and finding systematic features about something.
Now, the galactic center is a little different from this, but most of our work actually is in this way I just described to you. We are trying to understand how galaxies formed and evolved early in the universe. So that’s 12 billion years ago, about two or three billion years after the Big Bang.
So you’re using astronomy as a time machine because the speed of light is constant. And so as we look out in space with ever bigger telescopes and ever better equipment, we can look and see ever more details of the blue flowers and the red flowers and understand how they work.";13;Motivation
Could you tell me a little bit about your childhood? Were you interested in science as a young child?;"Andrea Ghez: Hindsight is always 20/20 in terms of where our interest in what we do originates. But I think I can identify that point in the moon landing. I was four, but I think that was what got me thinking about space and the enormity of space. But I think it’s also important to point out that at the same time I was saying I wanted to be an astronaut I was also saying I wanted to be a ballerina. So it wasn’t as if I, as a child, really understood science is my passion.
I’d say what definitely emerged was that I love puzzles – jigsaw puzzles, crossword puzzles, Sudoku. I see being a scientist as really fundamentally being a puzzle solver. Putting together the pieces, trying to find the evidence, trying to see the bigger picture.
I understood that I was interested in math and science by the time I went to college, I wanted to go to MIT. So I was clearly driven in that direction, but I went to college as a math major. But I was definitely thinking a lot about space. It used to keep me up at night. The enormity of space, just how small we are, our space and time is so insignificant on the scale of the universe. It’s both fascinating and horrifying at the same time. And I think that both of those aspects really took hold of me when I was young.";14;Family/Home Environment
Was there a particular person, like a teacher, a mentor, a role model that influenced you?;"I was so lucky. I had a lot of really wonderful role models in my life for lots of different aspects of it. First my parents were just great role models. My dad was a professor, so I was really exposed to the world of academia. What being a professor looked like, felt like, and he was always encouraging my curiosity. And then my mother was the director of a contemporary art gallery. So I had a really strong role model in terms of women going out and leading. I had an uncle who was a physicist. I have very clear memories of sitting around the kitchen table with my uncle and my dad talking about how the early Greeks learned, figured things out. And there was something so compelling about that – that process of the early understanding and the beauty of their discovery or their logic. So I think my uncle was a big figure early on.
And then there were teachers, I had an early chemistry teacher who was really encouraging. I was really fortunate in a sense that later in life I didn’t have many women science teachers. So she was an early encourager or advocate. I often tell my students that the most important decisions you make, especially later in life in grad school and even in college, is who your mentors are, who you work with because they just have such an important role in your professional development. You really want to work with people who have your back, who really want to encourage and nurture your development as a scientist. I was lucky as an undergrad to work with Hale Bradt and then as a grad student to work with Gerry Neugebauer, as well as Anneila Sargent who was sort of a secondary advisor to me. These were people who were just wonderfully supportive. So I’m really grateful.";14;Mentors (Role models)
Are there any particular lessons or life skills that you learned from them?;"Oh, gosh, I’ve learned so many things from them. Everybody has something to teach you. I think that’s one of the things that I’ve taken away along the way. That being able to interact with a large variety of people is important because each of those interactions has the potential to teach you about something. So my mother: ‘Just do it!’ was her, she had that down before Nancy Reagan did.
I think there were some really important lessons along the way about understanding how to deal with challenges, how to translate challenges into opportunities and Anneila Sargent, was particularly good – she provided me critical advice at a moment in graduate school where there was a hiccup and how to move a hiccup over into an opportunity, and figuring out how to stay focused on where you’re trying to go.
Similarly, and probably the most important lesson I think I ever learned from Gerry Neugebauer, as my PhD advisor, was pay attention to the data. That’s where the information is. And that the story may evolve around the data because more information will keep coming in, but you really have to pay attention to the data.";14;Mentors (Role models)
You talked about translating hiccups into an opportunity. How do you deal with challenges?;"It’s really important to realise that hiccups are a natural part of doing research. And that’s why I think that ability to deal with hiccups is so important. Research and discovery is about exploring our frontier of knowledge, where we don’t know, we don’t have everything worked out. It’s not neat and tidy.
I think it’s just an acceptance that things are hard and messy, things are complex. Your job as a scientist is to figure them out. You have to relish in the mess. It’s almost like the process of putting things together. Or if we come back to the puzzle analogy – you’re trying to figure out which goes with which, so some of them aren’t going to work and if you can view that as progress.
I think it’s just a viewpoint. I’ve now come to understand that’s something I take for granted, it isn’t necessarily how the world views things. I think it’s really interesting when things don’t work because that’s the path to discovery. Scientifically when you discover things that are inconsistent with how our current paradigm tells us things should look, it’s like, ‘Oh, well, this is interesting! There’s something more to be discovered here.’ In a sense, you could say that’s a failure of the theory, but it’s actually a huge opportunity for discovery and understanding. So if you really embrace that, if things don’t work, there’s something that can be learned.";14;Creativity
Is there a particular piece of advice that you would give to a young scientist?;"These days, one of the things I like to talk about with young scientists in my group, or anywhere is the idea that you want to take stock every few years of three things:
One is what is it that you love to do, what gives you pleasure? What do you find intriguing?
Two is what is it that you want to explore? It’s important to keep exploring because you don’t know what you’re going to enjoy until you try it. I’ll come back to an example of that for me, which really taught me that lesson.
And then the last thing is, how do you give back, how do you open up that opportunity for others to figure out what they enjoy? You’ve benefited from mentors. So how can you give back?
So those three things I think are useful to continually take stock of, because as you evolve the answer to the first thing isn’t going to stay the same. It’s just going to keep changing. So check in with yourself every once in a while.
The example that I like to share about trying things that you don’t know, or you might be afraid of, for me was public speaking. Given that I do so much of it now, I was terrified of public speaking, so much so that where I chose to go to graduate school was based on whether or not I had to teach, When I got to graduate school, I gave my first research talk and I shook from my head to my toe. I was so nervous. And my PhD advisor, Gerry Neugebauer said, you have to teach, you’ve got to get over this. So I ended up teaching and I discovered that I really enjoyed it. I quickly decided that I really wanted to teach the intro physics classes because there were very few women. So I took something that I liked, which is trying to expand or encourage young girls along for the ride. And it was just a great experience. I think I discovered my interest and passion for teaching as well as research.";14;Advice for young scientists
Is there any advice that you would give to young female scientists? What do you think we should do to encourage more women to do science and increase diversity in general?;"Well there’s two parts of that question, I think, which is how do you succeed? I think there’s some general advice, no matter who you are, which is the importance of community, having people that you can turn to to support you through all the bumps and wiggles that whatever path you’re on presents. That’s your support system. It’s your network, your professional family that no matter who you are you really need. I think the challenge when you’re a minority, no matter what your minority is, is making sure that that’s in place. There’s just less people to choose from that look like you, although, it’s true, that you can get support from people who don’t look like you. It’s just that you need a support system.
The other part of your question, is encouraging diversity. I think we learn so much when we bring different points of view to the table, I think that’s a really important part of the conversation. I personally think that the people with the biggest passions for doing the work are going to do the best work. So I think in some sense, the challenge, or the opportunity is, to feed that desire – that desire to succeed or the quest to want to know. To not suppress it, or inhibit those who have that desire to understand. As kids we’re all so curious, that’s just the way we learn about the world. I think for us really the challenge is to encourage that no matter who you are or what you look like.";14;Diversity in Science
You’re obviously very passionate about science and physics, but what do you like to do outside of work?;"I think it’s really important to have other things for many reasons – one it’s just healthy and two, sometimes you just need to look away from your problem, in order to sort it out, in some sense to give your brain a break or relax and see something from a different perspective.
I’ve always enjoyed doing something athletic. So today I love swimming but even that has been an interesting evolution. I started in high school as a runner and as a field hockey player. I went to college and I joined the cross country team, so I got into marathon running. Then I decided at the end I wanted to do a triathlon, but my swimming was really weak. So I joined the MIT swim team in my senior year for a bit. As a graduate student, I got into masters swimming and I’ve done masters swimming ever since.
For me, swimming or just being active has two really important components. One is that physically it’s really important to stay healthy. Often times I have to say the problems I have at work get sorted out in my head in the pool – it used to be running now it’s swimming. And then in terms of this idea of having a network of people, I love the masters swim team, it brings together people from all communities. So I have the social network, or place, also where I’m not a minority. At work there aren’t that many women, but it’s really nice to be part of a community where you don’t stand out. It also just gives you sort of fortitude, that’s really important.
I should say my other thing I do a lot of outside of work is I have two kids, so I take care of them. I mean they’re much older now, but being a mom has been a great addition to life. I’m really glad I got that opportunity. I think I’ve learned a lot from being a mom.";14;Free time
What do you like best about being a scientist?;"Gosh so many things. Maybe the best thing is I have a job I love. That’s the ultimate privilege in life, to love what you do. I feel very fortunate.
That’s not quite what you asked though. About being a scientist: I think it is being able to pursue questions that you define for yourself. Sometimes there’s a lot of freedom – no one’s telling you what to do. You’ve got to figure it out yourself, but that’s an amazing opportunity in life.";14;Motivation
What did you want to be when you were younger?;"James Peebles: Until I reached university, I was rather directionless. Never a rebel but rather a dreamer. I didn’t pay too much attention to classes, I am sure I annoyed my teachers, or to what I would want to do after I graduated from high school. So, I didn’t have a direction until I reached the University of Manitoba. There I learned that I love physics. I’m sure there were signs before I reached the university that I loved physics, for example I do remember as a youth I would read anything that was before me, the cereal boxes. I read in one of my older sister’s schoolbooks how compound pendulum works, and I still remember thinking how wonderful that is, and it was a hint, and I liked to build models. Because I liked to build models, I entered the university in engineering. I enjoyed it. I guess I could have made my ways through life as a mediocre engineer, but to my eternal gratitude of friend who I can name, Dale Loveridge, since I complained to him that we were running out of physics courses to take in engineering: “Why don’t you transfer to physics?”
Perhaps you know the phrase a “Duh” moment? Well, that was a “Duh” moment. Why didn’t I think of that? So, I entered physics and loved it from the start. I owe a lot to the faculty and I owe a lot to the students too. You know, students learn a lot from fellow students, we don’t give that enough attention, I think. Nothing I like better than to see students arguing over how to work a problem. Also, my fellow students introduced me to Allison. So I was married and off to Princeton university as graduate student. The faculty member who told me I would go to graduate school in physics to Princeton, Ken Standing, died just a year or so ago. It was a great pleasure to meet him prior to that. He had his own distinguished career in the structures of large biological molecules, biochemical molecules, I am not sure the phrase. Anyway, I love physics, it’s just grabs me and still does.";15;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
What do you enjoy about physics?;James Peebles: One way to put it, I think, is that event with the compound pulley. A compound pulley is that the one in the same time rather subtle, but yet explicit within the framework of the game. Similarly, physics is layer upon layer of concepts such as a compound pulley. Each compound, complex, what am I trying to say? Each element of physics is, when looked at from afar, a compound pulley. It’s a simple concept, well defined and subtle but yet direct straightforward in many ways. And physics is just a hierarchy of such things. I find that neat. I suppose I am also satisfied by the fact that in physics you get to settle arguments, because you can do experiments and you can find out whether or not this concept make sense. It’s also relative to say, oh, biology much simpler and I do treasure that simplicity. Again, my impression of a biologist is someone who’s waiting through depths and complications, it’s just so subtle. Whereas in basic physics, which is the kind I enjoy, you can actually start from the fundamentals and work your way up, layer upon layer of compound pulleys. You can’t do that with biophysics because it is just too, too complicated. I guess I could have made my way through life as a biophysicist too, but I wouldn’t has been as happy.;15;Motivation
Was there a particular person that influenced you?;James Peebles: Yes, I can mention two. I have already mentioned one, Ken Standing, at the University of Manitoba. You know I reflect back, and I don’t remember him ever saying: “I suggest you go to the University of Manitoba, Princeton for graduate study”. He was rather: “You will of course go to Princeton”. It set my life. If I hadn’t gone to Princeton I wouldn’t have met my second and really top adviser, professor Robert Henry Dicke, Bob to everyone, who was an inspiration when I arrived. He has doing gravity physics which of course lead to cosmology. He has just the sort of skills that I really take a delight in. He understands physics very well, but he understands also how to apply it and to be very, very much a person who likes the combination of theory and practice which totally grabbed me and still does. Bob Dicke I have called for many years my professor of continuing education. He’s alas no longer with us but through the years he taught me so much. Not only about physics, but also, don’t be messy with your physics. The one time he would get hostile was when you were sloppy in your thinking. And that certain cured me of being sloppy.;15;Mentors (Role models)
Can you tell us how you discovered you’d been awarded the Nobel Prize?;James Peebles: Do you know that in the US, perhaps around the world, there are sites in which you can place money, wagers, on events, such as who will get the Nobel Prize and it turns out that these sites have a pretty good record. You understand that the more money placed on a candidate for the Nobel Prize, the lower the pay-off. So, my university and I think many others, keep track of the odds on faculty members and so, for the last two years I have had an enigmatic message from our department of public relations: “If you need help with publicity we will come to your aid”. No explanation, no mention of Nobel, but at this time of year you wonder, so I was slightly prepared, and you know, to be honest, I think it was a good choice. I’ve been riding this wave my entire career, so, that was great. They called at a definite hour here in Sweden, which may be a very different hour at the Laureate’s home. So, five o’clock, the call, and you know at that hour either it’s something really bad or something really good, so, I was somewhat prepared when I picked up the telephone. Allison’s … my first words were: “Oh God!”. The university was prepared, and they had laid on elaborate celebrations through the day. Totally exhausting. But still, utterly rewarding.;15;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Do you have any advice for young scientists?;James Peebles: There is one piece of advice that I keep advising, keep offering: “Don’t judge your career by the number of prizes and awards. I have so many. It’s wonderful and the Nobel Prize is absolutely spectacularly wonderful, but to get such a prize requires not only dedication and creativity, it requires eventualities. The cards must line up just so, in order to make it appropriate for a prize-winning committee to recommend you, don’t count on those eventualities. Judge your career by how well you did at it. And of course, don’t be sloppy.;15;Advice for young scientists
Do you have any advice for young people entering science?;James Peebles: My advice, my central advice to a young person considering entering science of any sort, say in natural science: look around, discover what really interests you. It may not be the first thing that you notice, you may find something mildly interesting, but if you look a little harder, you’ll find something even better. Don’t jump into a particular line of research until you have looked around quite carefully and discover that which really fascinates you. If you are fascinated, you’ll do well.;15;Advice for young researchers
Why do you like teaching?;"James Peebles: You understand that teaching, the students learn from a good teacher and the teacher learns from the students. Also, you know, there is the comment of Samuel Johnson, “Nothing quite concentrates the mind like a prospect of being hanged” and that quite a serious, but the prospect of having a student ask a question that you haven’t anticipated, is something that makes me very uneasy. So, of course, when I teach, I prepare, and I try to think of all of those odd little side issues that I never perhaps thought through. They happen and I learn from that. Also, of course, it’s so lovely to see young people who are interested in something, so interested so they sit here and take notes from what I say. And, of course, I emphasize time and again, they are learning from each other. Nothing I love more than to see a group of students arguing over how to work a problem, so that’s rewarding. And because I love physics, you are not surprised to learn I enjoy talking about it and so, yes, I have taught both students who are advanced in physics, who are deeply interested in physics and those who take the course as a requirement.
The last is a far by far the most difficult. How do you persuade these people that physics is not simply a hurdle to pass so they can get on to do something they really want to do, perhaps medicine? How do you convince them that this is a fascinating subject? In part, you know, I think we have to be fatalistic about that, some people are charmed by compound pulley and some are not. Perhaps you don’t particularly care about compound pulleys, but they are neat, and perhaps not neat for you, but some for they are. So, I guess I do have the seat-of-the-pants feeling, feeling that different people are suited for very different activities, that’s obvious isn’t it, must be. So, my test might be, offer them a compound pulley, do you think that is neat or would you rather that I would stop talking about it. So, most of the time I have taught people who think compound pulley is neat even though they’ve never considered that before. By far, as I say, the most difficult is teaching those who’s not so sure compound pulleys are neat. The most depressing question is: “Is this going to be on the exam?”";15;Mentors (Role models)
What are the most important qualities for being a teacher?;James Peebles: The most important quality of being a teacher, I think, surely is the enthusiasm for what you are trying to teach. And perhaps it’s equally important, you should pay attention to the students. That seems pretty obvious, but I suppose if you are a teacher who don’t enjoy your job, then I think it would be good of you to find another line of work. If you enjoy your job it means you are just love transforming, transmitting information to the student. And you will notice the student either understanding what you’re saying or not and if the latter you’re going to try hard to get the student’s attention. That was when we used to have an hour and a half long lectures, to stop half way in between was a good way, not only to get them awake, because it’s rather hard to sit for an hour and a half, but also I found, there are students who have questions but they don’t want to ask them, because they don’t want to be the subject of attention and the breaks were a wonderful way for a student who was diffident to approach me. I don’t know how to encourage these people to speak up, no one is going to bite them, some people are just like that. The break was always a good way, not only to refresh all of the students but also to give the diffident ones to get a chance to talk to me.;15;Mentors (Role models)
What do you enjoy doing in your free time?;James Peebles: As I have reached the golden years, I find that I enjoy physics, so I don’t often take much time off. I love going into the laboratory and writing and calculating or reading. I used to enjoy gardening quite a lot. In recent years physical effort is becoming more difficult. The fact that the market gardens have tomatoes in immense abundance when I have my pitiful few tomatoes, I stopped gardening. However, I spent the last two years full time on a book on how we got from where we were in the past to now in cosmology. The book is now done. It will be out next spring. I have still some deep jobs to do in checking proofs, but that labour is pretty much over and I think I will not get myself involved in another project that is quite that intense and that maybe I will start gardening again. I think maybe flowers rather than vegetables.;15;Free time
Where do you do your best thinking?;James Peebles: I’m deeply fortunate that we live just one mile from my office. It’s a mile through almost entirely quiet residential streets, so walking to and from the lab is to me refreshing and a chance to let my mind wander. I’ve always, when walking, paid very little attention to where I put my feet and so the mind can wander in totally random, irrelevant silly directions, but sometimes it will land on a little point: “Why didn’t I think of this?”, rather a “Duh”-trip moment. Though it’s interesting, I discovered a few years ago that I was tripping and, you know, a face-plant when you fall, it happened to me three times in one year. No injuries at any time but it’s such a chock to suddenly find yourself prone. So, I’ve started looking where I put my feet to the detriment of my thinking. Which should I do? I think I will continue to watch where I put my feet, I will put a little more attention to that, but I also will continue to enjoy walking and letting my mind wander. I hate running. I can’t imagine operating a treadmill or pumping weights, that’s sounds so dull. But to me a walk in the woods or in the city is pleasant – always is.;15;Environment
What do we still have to discover?;James Peebles: In our field we are leaving to the future generations a lot of interesting research problems. It is rather difficult to convince non-scientists of the fact that we at the same time have a reliable science, well-established and yet there are simple questions they can ask of you that you can’t answer. It’s particularly notable in cosmology when you consider that we postulate this dark matter, we postulate this cosmological constant or dark energy. They surely have deep physical meaning, that we do not understand, what a glorious opportunity, explain this. It is as I say, a subtle business to explain that we have both great open problems and yet a securely established physics. The point is, of course, all of our physics are approximations, we have no complete theory in any branch of physics or in any other natural science. We instead have approximations that are good or more or less well-established depending on the evidence. We have so much evidence for cosmology that I think it is almost a dead cert that the dark matter’s there. We know that its properties must be in a defined range, but that range is pretty broad. We’re sure that there must be there and the great triumph would be to identify it. Lots of experiments are going on attempting to do that, watch your local newspaper, for announcements.;15;Creativity
What did you want to be when you were younger?;Michel Mayor: When I was a child, I was in fact interested in science from the age of 10 years. Not specifically astronomy, but science. I was really a fan of quite different subjects: geophysics, plants and so on. When I was obliged to start a choice at university, it was for me very difficult to choose between mathematics and physics, so for the first year I chose both. After that I had to choose one and I chose to study theoretical physics. When I finished in 1966, it was quite easy to get a position as a PhD student because every laboratory was increasing, recruiting young people and so on. It was a little bit by chance that I choose astrophysics because on the same day, you have several opportunities, in statistics and mechanics, rather different domains. I said, “Okay, astrophysics, I will go and see if it is interesting”. I chose to continue and do my PhD in the domain of theoretical astrophysics. It was related to the problem of spiral waves and spiral galaxies. You are looking at a nice picture of a galaxy, you have sometimes two big arms. I did my PhD in this domain, absolutely nothing related to planets or velocities. This arrived only later.;16;Family/Home Environment (Supports)
Was there a particular moment that sparked your interest in science?;"Michel Mayor: I’m not sure to have a specific moment where I started to say I will do my full life in the domain of science. I believe it was the responsibility of a very good teacher. At some moment between 12 and 16 I had a fantastic teacher in science who was doing experiments, extremely stimulating. It was not a moment, but the contact with this man having really stimulated the interest of myself but also all the younger colleagues. At some moment, he tried to show us some chemical reaction with chlorine. It’s a very dangerous gas and probably today it would be completely forbidden to do this kind of experiment. He said, “Oh, it’s a little bit dangerous, so I suggest you go outside in the back yard to do the experiment outside to not smell the chlorine”. He did a fascinating experiment, putting some copper inside this gas to show that it started to burn, and things like this. We also did quite a lot outside visits to the forest to see flowers and observe them. This was the important moment.
Maybe I can suggest another aspect of this relatively old professor. During his lifetime as an elementary school teacher, he continued to do his own research at home. He was studying nematodes, this nasty worm you can have inside your body. He was a renowned man in this field. For us, it was very impressive to this teacher having at home continuing research, receiving dirty water from any place in the world to identify new species of nematodes. Eventually I did not choose to study nematodes, but extrasolar planets.";16;Motivation
What do you enjoy about science?;Michel Mayor: I believe science is one very fabulous way to satisfy your curiosity. I still have the same curiosity today when I’m reading some journal, equivalent to the Scientific American or general /- – -/. It’s so fascinating to see such the huge diversity of the work going on in the fundament of science, geophysics, archeology, medicine and so on. For me, it’s better than any fiction. I’m still continuing to have the same interest for the kind of research done by colleagues, and here it’s a good opportunity to meet people working in different domains. I love this.;16;Motivation
What are the traits needed to be a scientist?;Michel Mayor: Curiosity is the most important point to be a scientist. If a student is good enough in all the basic tools of science, mathematics, physics and so on, and love to study natural problems, to see what kind of very unusual phenomena exist in the nature. “Why is this like this?” Sometimes you are looking at the sky and you have some clouds and you see some bright spots apart from the sun. “Why is it like this?” If he has this kind of mind, he could do science.;16;Competencies
Do you enjoy teaching and mentoring?;"Michel Mayor: I was appointed as a professor at the university during more than 20 years, so I believe I enjoyed it. I had to do some mandatory courses in astrophysics, but in addition to this, I had the choice to teach some different topics as the master degree, so you can choose. I would like to learn a little bit more in this domain, so you work to prepare the course and I liked to do that.
I’m very proud that I had I believe 18 PhD students in my life and I still have very good relationships with all of them. I was very proud that during many, many years, all of them got positions in science and continued to work in science. This was part of the pleasure of the Nobel Prize announcement. A few days ago, we had a special celebration at the observatory in Geneva. Some of my PhD students went from Chile, from South America, from Brazil, from the south of Italy to participate in this celebration. So, I believe, it’s good friends.";16;Motivation
What do you look for in a PhD student?;Michel Mayor: I don’t know how we have to select people because it’s not always because they are absolutely extremely good at the university that they will be the best. I believe it’s how to select. Sometimes you believe that they will be extremely good and some are not so good, and sometimes you have someone who’s absolutely fantastic, asking good questions and so on. We don’t have a checklist to select people after, we have to try and see.;16;Competencies
Can you tell us about your relationship with co-laureate Didier Queloz?;Michel Mayor: Didier was one of my undergraduate students first. After that he did his master thesis with me in the domain related to spectroscopy and things like this. Thereafter it was time for his PhD he chose to continue with me as a supervisor. It was just the beginning of a collaboration with some French colleagues to build a new instrument. It was a good opportunity so I asked him if he would like to collaborate with this development. It was the start of this long-term collaboration with him. He developed part of the software to analyze the signal we received. After the success at the end of a few years, before his PhD, there was the discovery of the first planet, and for him at least, it was a start in this domain, it’s evident. We have continued to work together for several years and still today we have some collaboration, part of the time in Cambridge, but also part of the time in Geneva we continued to collaborate.;16;Creativity
How important is it to be open to new ideas and unexpected findings?;Michel Mayor: In principle, this is one of the most important points of science, to be prepared for the unexpected. If you are not, only working on what you almost know before, it is not a way to make progress. You must always be prepared for the unexpected. In the beginning the program was to search for a low mass companion to solar-type stars. It was mentioned brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets. Brown dwarfs are a very small stellar companions, having a mass too small to ignite and to start a nuclear reaction. But at the time, nobody knew what could be the period for this set of objects, so in some sense, it was a chance for us because we had adapted a rhythm of measurement to either kind of period. Then it was a chance because we discovered an object with the period of only four days. If we had started only from the theory, the period of a planet would be more like 10 years. We would have done quite sparse sampling of measurements. The fact that we had open eyes created a chance for us.;16;Creativity
How do you deal with doubts in science?;"Michel Mayor: Part of this doubt is a normal discussion in science. When you have new facts, I believe you have to be sure to analyze if it’s really strong. You have to remember that the first planet is a giant planet, like Jupiter, but with an orbital period of only 4.2 days. The theory at that time said that we cannot have a giant planet with a period shorter than ten years, because you need to agglomerate an ice particle and an ice particle does not exist close to a star. So it was a discovery by factor 1,000 with a theory. I believe it’s evident a normal discussion in science when you have a so big discrepancy with the theory, to be a little bit cautious.
This period for me was not so stressful, it’s not true. I believe it was superior to say, “What could be the other explanation? Is it a rotating star with magnetic activity? Is it a pulsation? For me it was only part of the normal discussion in science. You have something you need to understand, what could it be? Then after we had decided to postpone the announcement by one year, to wait to the next season, to repeat the measurement, to check if everything was still there – the same period, the same amplitude, the same phase and so on. It was only the first week of July, the only hypothesis to explain this is a companion, a low mass companion, plant three domain. So, we started to write the paper.";16;Creativity
How did you discover you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Michel Mayor: I knew that many years ago I had been nominated for the Nobel Prize. But you know, I was not the only one. Several other people were also nominated, so I wasn’t surprised to not receive anything. I decided with my family that we didn’t mind all this, so we took vacation in October. We were taking professional commitment and things like this. This was the reason why we were in Spain and I was absolutely not looking or waiting for that. Then just before the announcement by professor Hansson we were leaving San Sebastián for the airport and I connected my computer. Suddenly I saw the beginning of the press conference at the academy and the first word was something like, “This this year, the prize will be given to three people having contributed to a better knowledge of the cosmos.” I said, “Oh, interesting domain”, and then after I heard the three names and then it was time to leave for the airport and then we tried to have a connection with the Nobel Foundation.;16;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How has your family supported you personally or professionally?;Michel Mayor: The life of an astronomer, going frequently to observe in many places in Europe and in addition to scientific conferences, it will be many months away from the family. Certainly when you have small children all of the burden of this situation was on the shoulders of my wife. From time to time we have been lucky enough to have the possibility to move all the family in south of France or later on in Chile. But nevertheless I had the huge support of my wife and three children working later on in science. Probably science was not too badly considered by my children, if they’ll have children, to continued, not in astrophysics, but in some domain of science.;16;Family/Home Environment
What do you do in your free time?;Michel Mayor: My hobby, when I was young enough, I really loved climbing – high altitude sports, rock climbing, high altitude skiing and things like this. Evidently today, I like to continue hiking but no more climbing. But I still like to do downhill skiing, cross country skiing and things like that. I feel that when you are hiking, you have time to think on new ideas. I hope you spend some time just to admire the countryside, but also, I believe it’s the activity to walk. It’s very nice to have time to think, you have no e-mails, you have nothing. It’s good. I believe this is an important part of this kind of activity.;16;Free time
What fascinates you about the universe?;"Michel Mayor: If you are in a dark place, on a /- – -/ or the top of a mountain and you’re looking at the sky, it’s difficult to escape good questions. Still today, I’m really fond of astrophysics.
Like many people in the past, you ask, “What is this?” This is a good aspect of astrophysics. You always have the possibility, if you are away from light of dawn, to ask this kind of question. For example, when you are in Chile, the center of the Milky Way at some moment, it is just at the zenith of where you are observing. You have the Milky Way here, it’s absolutely fantastic to see this, because it’s much brighter than in the northern sky.";16;Motivation
How long do you think it will be before we detect life beyond Earth?;Michel Mayor: During the last 20-25 years, we have been lucky to explore all the diversity of the planetary system. Already today many colleagues are working on this specific new domain. Do we have such capabilities and possibilities to detect life? I’m quite sure that we know how to detect life. But we still do not have the good instrumentation to do it, but we have the path of how to do it. It’s a matter of years, money and maybe to have new, better ideas. I would say in one generation, it’s not for next year. It’s very difficult, but I’m quite confident. I don’t know the answer, but we will have the instrumentation to search and it’s good, it’s a good question. In science, it’s absolutely fantastic to still have extremely huge questions not solved. Cosmology, black holes, life in the universe, these are not details, so for young people, I believe it’s so nice to have huge questions still facing us.;16;Future Research
Could we live on these other exoplanets that have been found?;Michel Mayor: The question of the possibility for humanity to move to an extrasolar planet is a very important question for me. I’d like to stop this kind of dream. If you consider that man went to the moon in three days, light needs one second. Let’s consider that a very optimistic possibility is to have maybe one good planet. Good in the sense that we can have good conditions at 30 light years. 30 light years is really our neighbour. Nevertheless, approximately one billion light years, one millionth second for the light to go. One billion times three days is completely crazy, that’s millions of years. So, there’s no way to go. Some people say we can accelerate the spacecraft, no, the energy to accelerate is impossible. Our planet is alive, there is not another one. We don’t have the possibility to immigrate. I’m not discussing the solar system, but extrasolar planets are not a possibility to immigrate for humanity. And Earth is so beautiful – why?;16;Future Research
How special is Earth?;Michel Mayor: We are lacking the experience to compare another planet to ours. The only things we can say is that we have 200 billion stars in the Milky Way. If only one planetary system among 100 is convenient for a rocky planet it is still a big number. Let’s imagine how many planets in the universe are convenient for life. This is the next big question to search for. Not for very distant planets, but to analyse if life exists on much closer planets – and it is not going to these planets but just analyzing the luminosity and the spectra of these planets.;16;Meaning of Work
Where do you get your passion for science?;Didier Queloz: I think my passion for science may be something that I had in the blood early on, because I think I was born very curious. I’ve always been very curious. I believe I’ve always been very creative. I love to play and doing stuff and always very curious about understanding ‒ how does it work? When I was a kid, I used to break apart stuff just to understand how it works. Of course I was not able to bring it back. It was not something very nice sometimes for my mother. But I think I’m a born scientist, I’m very curious and very math gifted, so I went naturally into physics because that’s something I feel at ease and that’s something that was responding to my internal voice that maybe that’s something I should be doing.;17;Motivation
What do you like about science?;Didier Queloz: I can never stop asking myself, ”Why is that?” or ”How does it work?” and ”Why did we do that and not that?” I’m also curious about … It’s not about physics only, it can be about psychological patterns, about the way society works or the way the financial system works. I think I’m very eclectic, and it’s kind of a soft madness in a way that I always want to answer and obviously I very rarely got any answers, but I really want to answer. That does cause this kind of emotional drive or maybe even a bit obsessive drive that brought me to science.;17;Motivation
Was there a certain person that influenced you growing up?;Didier Queloz: I cannot identify a specific person that had a specific influence, but I have had a lot of people that may have played some role. First, I have a very supportive family, so I think this is essential. I don’t think if you are under stress and under threat in your family, it’s not possible to do that, you have to get a free mind. I can really do what I want, which is what I wanted, which was certainly a good starting point. I have had very interesting teachers sometimes because it was the seventies, new teaching in the seventies, a new PhD theory, so they were kind of funny teachers. Maybe it helped to develop some creativity in me. I cannot really say I have had amazing physics teachers, but I remember very well my mathematic teachers and I liked them very much, I mean they really brought me to mathematics and then I went to physics. I realised that there were a lot of cool topics that I didn’t know. I read a lot of books, some of the almost public oriented writers like Carl Sagan for example, was one of them. I got very thrilled by this and all this together was a nice music to my ear. They all together brought me to to become a physicist and then working on astrophysics.;17;Mentor(Role Models)
What was it like to work with your co-laureate Michel Mayor?;Didier Queloz: That’s the interesting aspect of working with Michel. I think I picked Michel because I think we are very similar in the way we operate, we’re very instinctive. We are kind of emotional and maybe we can say Michel is not very academic in that style, so it’s all by touch. It’s a bit like doing paintings. I cannot say something specific, but the whole touch paintings that you get by working with Michel ‒ bits here and bits there ‒ I think was amazingly useful. Still today, I just love being with Michel. I love listening to his perspective on things. He sometimes has an awkward perspective and I like it. I think we all need what I call a mentor, an inspiration. Michel was certainly a mentor to me. I learned a lot and he helped me at least to develop some skills, not directly but just by being with him and maybe having some discussions about something, and then they would help me to think in a different way and to develop other skills. I must say I’ve been very fortunate to work with Michel and I hope the same for him because I think the discovery was an amazing teamwork.;17;Creativity
What advice do you give to your students?;Didier Queloz: It’s always difficult to give advice to students, but usually the way I interact with my students is that I try to do what’s called “light touch supervision”. This means you are always there when they really feel under stress, because that’s why we are here really, to do a net. But it’s also up to them to find a way. You can show the way, we can suggest the way, but very quickly I try to promote this kind of spirit, let’s say an artistic spirit, that they try their own way to go through with what they’re doing. In a bit of a provocative way, if I try to translate that it’s, don’t listen to your supervisor, in a way. Do it as you feel. Of course, you should not apply that strictly speaking, but I think it’s part of this kind of light touch. That helps to develop confidence in yourself, that you can do something without being told that you can do it. It also helps you to listen and to try to grab the advice that is the one that fits you the most. I think to me that’s a perfect interaction you should have between a student and a supervisor, and that’s something that all students have to understand, they should really develop their own perspective on things. They should not be afraid to build confidence. Quite often I’m facing a lack of confidence. The confidence is a matter of our self respect and also self build up, and the best way to build up confidence is just to do the things, so do the thing. Don’t listen too much to your supervisor, listen to your guts.;17;Advice for young researchers
What do your students teach you?;Didier Queloz: The reason why I love working with students is that every day they teach me something. First, their brain is much more fresh than mine. They come with a very fresh perspective and sometimes bring new ideas. I got too spoiled because I know too much, which is bad if you want to be creative at some point. But they come with so much energy that is so wonderful. I just love working with students, PhD students and working teams. I think that makes my day really happy.;17;Advice for young researchers
You received a Nobel Prize for your PhD. How can someone follow in your footsteps?;"Didier Queloz: I was a PhD student, that’s true, but you know, in all discovery it’s a matter of luck, it’s a bit of a gamble. We have been lucky. We could have been scooped, other people could have found this before us. We have been lucky, we work right. I think the fact that I was a PhD student certainly played some role because I came up with maybe a fresh perspective. In another way, maybe that Michel would’ve done it, so this kind of teamwork that we had with someone way more experienced and somebody way more energetic and maybe more naive and creative in a way, was a terrific team. But there’s no rule, just do what you think.
When I was doing that, I never thought about a Nobel Prize at all. I just thought it was cool, what I was doing, because I just loved it. I was doing something new. I was pushing the boundary of the knowledge, and it was great because we were doing this work. We were excited about what we were talking and discovering and announcing to the world, but at no point, I thought I would build a career and have a Nobel Prize. So I think it doesn’t really matter if you’re a PhD or if you are a junior scientist, just do it because you believe you have to do it and just have fun when you’re doing it.";17;Impact of the Nobel on you
How did you discover that you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Didier Queloz: Oh, my day was really awful. I had a problem with my bike and I had to fix my bike and I was late and the day was starting really on the wrong foot. Then it turned completely in another direction after this phone call. Not from the Nobel committee, actually, they failed to reach me, but by the PR office of Cambridge, because I was at Cambridge, they called me and told me after the announcement, because I was not at all looking at that, I was in the middle of a meeting. I was really … The Nobel Prize was the last of my worries, and they told me, “Are you aware that you got the Nobel Prize?” At first I thought it was a joke, and then I realised it was the 8th of October and I said, “Are you sure?” I was not so convinced, in the way I asked them, “Are you sure?” For a moment, they said, “Oh, just wait for a minute, we’re checking,” and they came back. “Oh yes, that’s you, we see your face.” “Okay,” I said, “Oh, my god”, then I lost track of the day. They asked me what I would do with the prize, and I was so annoyed with this bike, I said, “I’m going to buy a new bike”. That definitely is in the plan, so I’m looking for buying a new bike.;17;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Is there a Nobel Laureate that has influenced you?;Didier Queloz: This is a difficult question, see if there is any other past Nobel laureates. When you look at the list, there is so many great figures, so many great physicists. I cannot identify some specific one, but there are certainly a lot of great names that, when I was a student in physics, I learned the history and I learned what they did. Certainly the Nobel laureates is a good pool to pick a great lot of people from, but I don’t have a specific name to tell you right now.;17;Mentors (Role models)
How does it feel to be a Nobel Laureate?;Didier Queloz: I’m still learning what does it mean right now, to become a Nobel Laureate. It seems so extravagant right now, what is going around this. I don’t really know, I just saw the first effect. Everybody seems to be interested by me and they all want my signature, that’s what I see right now. I’m waiting a little bit for all this to go down because I don’t feel that very different. I’m still the same person. I don’t think my science will be very different. But certainly I do feel a sense of responsibility with this prize, and it will take a bit of time for me to digest absolutely everything, what it means and what I can do with this prize.;17;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What do you do in your free time?;Didier Queloz: I don’t have a lot of free time, that’s my problem. The time I have left I try to dedicate to my family and to my wife. We love just taking care of the house, doing gardening and when we can, traveling a little bit. I save a bit of time to go in the mountains because I love to ski, so to do skiing. We are trying to save a bit more time to just go to a nice place when we can, just go to the beach and enjoy, a bit more relaxing time. That’s really optimizing the few time I have. Most of my time, it’s absolutely obsessive about science, it’s just a disaster, it’s just so obsessed.;17;Free time
Why should young people go into science?;Didier Queloz: I think people that have an interest for questions and like the rational reasoning and even if you are gifted for logical thinking and mathematics, which is not everybody, but if you are gifted, you have to do science because that’s where you will develop all these gifts the best you can. Science is essential to the society, it’s everywhere, all the science. Our society where we’re living is the outcome of science. Your cell phone is full of science. I think we need scientists and what we need the most is not only scientists, it’s scientists in the government making policies. Because when you look in the parliament, when you look in the governments, there is an absolute lack of scientists compared to the weight of science in our society. I really encourage people to do science, and if at some point they decide to become prime minister or president or parliament members, they should do it, because we need these people there to rebalance a bit of society. Really, and please do it, and please, please, please, if you are a woman, don’t feel science is not for you. This is all wrong. I mean, science is for everybody. We need all the bright men and we need you. We are missing women right now because we are missing certainly gifted women for science. For some social and family pressure, they don’t go into science, which is an absolute disaster. I think they should really join it and try. Diversity in science is essential to the science. When you look back, science is about traveling, freedom of travel, freedom of expressions and getting the best people in the world. There is a limited number of people gifted. They’re all around the world and we need to have them. If diversity is not represented in science, it means we’re losing capability, we’re losing people, we’re losing brains.;17;Motivation
Do you think there’s life out there in our universe? How long will it take to find it?;"Didier Queloz: We have so many planets that the question of life is obvious, that’s the next step. I’m absolutely convinced there must be life somewhere else because I can’t believe life is unique in the universe. There’s too many stars, too many planets; that’s pretty clear. Now what is still not very well understood is what is the origin of life? And what you need as ingredients? Life is chemistry. In a way it’s a kind of chemistry that is turning bad because the chemistry that leads to something that is evolving and then by itself, evolving to something more complicated. Now the question is, what do you need? We definitely can look at this in the lab, here on earth, and we can look at this on Mars, on Venus and Enceladus, there’s couple of other satellites in the solar system where you can look at that. Then you can try to look on other planets.
The question of what exactly do you look at is not very clear, but it is believed that at some point the geophysics of a planet should tell you something about whether there is life or not. It’s a long way, it’s a long path because we don’t even connect exactly the origin of life on the solar system. It’s something I’ve started spending quite a lot of time on. I started this project a couple of years ago because that was my main focus. When I moved to Cambridge I was trying to establish a new path here, and there has been progress. The interesting part of this progress, is that it doesn’t come from only astrophysics. It comes by combining what the astrophysicists are doing, with what other people not really dealing very much with stars, because they’re dealing with molecules in labs. It’s called molecular biology.
There has been a lot of progress on the origin of life from the molecular biology perspective, the ingredients, the unit, what is the simplest unit and how do you build them? What is the condition for that? Then the condition is something that the astronomers can provide. We’re trying to get an idea, what is the atmosphere about, what is the kind of planet we’re talking about? Do we have plate tectonics? Do you have magnetic field – all this does it. What is the role of all this to initiate the chemistry, to have the chemistry right? That’s a new field that I’m talking about, which is at the boundary between different fields, that connect different disciplines together. This is my next big goal. I’m not claiming I will find the answers to that, because these are big questions, but I will definitely work on this, I am working on that already.
The most obvious element that we are missing in the /- – -/ right now is to find another earth like us. We have failed right now because we have not been able to deploy the right equipment to do that. We know how to do it, we just need to implement it. I have built up an international program on that called Terra hunting. A lot of universities in the world are having new equipment being built, and we will dedicate a quest for that kind of object, a telescope doing only that, and there may be others in the future. Then we have to build up the equipment to analyse the atmosphere of these planets. There will be a next generation of space equipment and people are now talking about this. This is really my main activity where I’m moving right now. I’m trying to accrete people, young people on this, and hopefully this Nobel Prize will be helpful for that, to stimulate these new developments.
People are convinced that this is what is coming next, but it’s difficult to implement it because since we are building a new science it doesn’t really fit in the usual box. When you have a usual activity, it’s easy, but when you do something really new, like life questions, so, there must be life somewhere. We are going to make progress on the origin of life on earth and possibly to find life that could be like the life we have on earth or another kind of life, other kinds of chemistry certainly within the next 50 to 100 years.";17;Future Research
What are the benefits of working in an international setting?;Gérard Mourou: I think that I always believed that science should be used to unify people and I’m a strong believer in this and it’s like music and everybody speaks the same language and science is the same thing. In science we all speak the same language and we work on the same problems and we try to make this world better.;19;Environment
Where does your passion for science come from?;Gérard Mourou: The passion of lights, in fact, comes from the laser. The first time I’ve seen the lasers, I said “Wow”, I couldn’t believe, to see this light, so well behaved, this beam of light, with pure colours. That was direct captivating for me and kept me ongoing for 45 years.;19;Motivation
How did it feel to discover you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Gérard Mourou: Of course the culmination of a career as a physicist is winning the Nobel Prize and then when you get this phone call from Stockholm … I knew of course that the Nobel Prize for Physics is always given on the first Tuesday of October and before noon. And I was kind of waiting, even if I had a small chance, waiting and also interested to know who was going to get it. But anyway I’m a harried swimmer, so I was on my way to go to the swimming pool and my secretary just waved at me and said “Gérard, could you come back. We have a phone call for you from Sweden, from Stockholm”. Oh, wow /---/, and so I picked up the phone and of course it was coming from Stockholm and so I almost crashed because it’s dynamite [laughing] when you hear it and that change your life also.;19;Impact of Nobel on you
How relevant has persistence been to your career?;Gérard Mourou: Oh, this has been extremely relevant. One thing I’ve done … we have invented a new type of laser with Donna Strickland, my co-laureate and student. We invented the lasers and in a process of aligning the laser my student, not Donna, but another student, got the beam in his eye, and so we took the student … he was not wearing goggles like he was supposed to, but accidents happen and so we took him to the hospital where is an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist looked in his eyes, his retina and so on and he said: “Hm, yeah, you got the laser in your eye, in your retina. Your retina is burned.” but he said: ”What type of laser is it?” and the student told him it was a new type of laser, he said, and he asked him “Why are you asking these questions?” “Well, because the damage you have in your eye is perfect”. And that started what now is femtosecond ophthalmology. There is millions of people now using the femtosecond laser for surgery. So it was really clearly a mistake. It was not planned at all. That opened up a completely new field and you have millions of people who are benefitting from this application now.;19;Career Development
Are environmental issues close to your heart?;Gérard Mourou: This is very close to my heart. All the environmental issues, I will say, is on the top of my preoccupations because we see every day of course that science brings a lot of goffe technology, brings technology on, but now it is science. We invented in fact a new terms for this type of science, should be ‘toilet science’, do you understand, ‘toilet science’, because some of the science help to destroy the planet with all the technology that came out of that, so we should really now think about really cleaning the mess, basically, which has been done, we have to say that as a consequence of this new science and technology.;19;Motivation
What responsibilities do scientists have to the environment?;Gérard Mourou: I would say yes, we have to be very careful about what we do. I think it’s of course … you have sciences then you have engineers and technologies and then you have products and consumers and so on. I think for scientists we really need to discover work on improving cleaning the planet for instance in nuclear power we have always nuclear waste. We are working with lasers on trying to basically improve the situations because nuclear energy is certainly a very important source of energy which could be very clean at one conditions, we have to clean up the waste after that. If we come up with reasonable solutions to clean up this waste, then that will be a fantastic improvement.;19;Meaning (Values) of Work
What is the scope for future applications of lasers?;Gérard Mourou.: The scope for our lasers is enormous, it’s enormous. In 1960 the laser was demonstrated by Ted Maiman but it was invented by Townes and as soon as the laser was invented people were saying “What’s going to be the use of this laser?” So they tried to find applications for the lasers, they tried to find applications In fact when we also demonstrated the very ultra-high intensity lasers that we got the prize for, also we weren’t sure about the applications and now we have of course enormous amount of applications. And what I like, of course, is applications in the medical, in medicines and so on. It’s very important. It’s on the top of my agenda.;19;Future Research
What is your advice for young scientists?;Gérard Mourou: I think I have only one advice for students who would really like to get into science and researching on that. You have to be passionate. If you don’t, if you are not passionate about it, you should do something else. It has to come from the heart of you because it’s very hard. It’s very hard for you but also, I have to say, for the family because you are always thinking about your research, because you are passionate. So you are thinking only about one thing and so sometimes it’s tough for the people who are with you.;19;Advice for young scientists
Besides passion, what are the qualities top scientists need to have?;Gérard Mourou: I mean the type of quality you need, of course, is the ability to endure being long time in the lab and be patient and obstinate. You have to be focused.;19;Competencies
What do you do in your spare time?;Gérard Mourou: My swimming is very important. I’m swimming. Well, I’m a skier. I was born in the French Alps. This town was named Albertville and where we have the Olympic Games and so skiing is basically a natural thing for me but also I love swimming. Swimming for me is like yoga, it’s very peaceful. I’m talking about open water swimming, and I love that.;19;Free time
When swimming, you aren’t thinking about your research?;Gérard Mourou: That’s right and I have a problem because, when I think about this, I’m in a state when I’m swimming. You are totally relaxed but also you are thinking about your research and that’s a problem because some time I forget the number of laps I’m doing.;19;Creativity
Who inspired you in the beginning of your journey?;Gérard Mourou: Because my dad was working in an electrical power company in the Alps, the French Alps, so we were always talking about current, power, amperes, voltage and things like transformers and all that because this is what he was doing and he was always explaining to me how these were working … with my dad, playing chess and doing, I mean learning about physics, yes.;19;Mentor(Role Models)
What do you enjoy about working with graduate students?;Gérard Mourou: Working with graduate students is like with your family, being with really your family. I mean that’s a way I always treated my students. We stay in the labs together, we discuss in the lab, weekends we spend together and so on, I mean, always thinking about what we want to achieve and that brings the students and the faculty together and we are aging, the faculty is aging, but we’re renewed, our students are renewed, so we are always close to the very young students and I’m very pleased also that many of my students, a few, well many, about ten will be attending the Nobel Lecture and the events.;19;Competencies
How has your research been applied over the years?;"Gérard Mourou: Since the very beginning I was very attracted by trying to really produce very, very short pulses. In the beginning it was the picosecond and then femtosecond and then attosecond and so on. So picosecond is 10-12 so it’s one thousandth of a billionth of a second and a femtosecond is a billionth of a millionth of a second. And I was always fascinated by what you could do because we could really, for the first time, we could see things moving in these time scales and of course we are not moving in these time scales, but molecules, atoms, electrons and all that, they move in this time scale and of course your eye is too slow to follow them. So trying to understand the world with this new tool, this tool of having very short pulses so you can track down the evolutions of very small systems to understand reactions and that, this is really extremely fascinating.
Then came the second application and the second application. If you are producing these very, very short pulses, then you can produce, if you are smart, very high intensity, very high peak power, and this is where we had a problem, with Donna, is a fact, because the pulses are short, the power that you are trying to get, can be very high, but at one point you are breaking down the laser because the power, the peak power is too high. And that’s of a clamp down the laser power that you can produce and it’s where we came up, with Donna, with this idea of CPA which is chirped pulse amplification, which could circumvent these problems of the laser being destroyed as we were amplifying the pulse and getting more peak power.";19;Research
Can you summarise your discovery in 30 seconds?;Gérard Mourou: My Nobel Prize was awarded because of my work with laser, with very, very short pulse laser, and why do you want to have very short pulse lasers? It is because these pulses will be also important for communications, very important for communication in general, very important also in the medical world, very important for many other disciplines. Because with these very short pulses you will be able really to observe or to track down reactions which happen in cells, but also which may happen also in a transistor for instance for communication, fast electronics and so on and also because this very short pulse gives you viability to produce, over a very short time, extremely high peak power so you can use that for nuclear physics and maybe also trying to understand events which are happening in the cosmos. Because you can really produce the highest temperature, the highest pressure, the highest field, the highest gravity, so you can really simulate and bring back into the lab what is happening in the cosmos and in life in general.;19;Research
How did you become interested in science?;Donna Strickland: I have been asked that question about how I got interested in science quite a bit. I think it just is my education system. It’s hard to say, I mean, my dad was an engineer and my mother was a high school teacher and so I think education was very big for both of them, so they did take us to things like the Toronto Science Centre and they did take us to these Audubon lectures about birds. And I have to say, it did not spark any interest in birds with me so I don’t know … But not everybody gets raised by parents that are as interested in education and studies that way. But I think it is mostly because in school, I did very well in maths and science. I was one of those kids that thought science class was fun and most people don’t, so, I don’t know why, I just did.;20;Motivation
Did you have a teacher that particularly inspired you?;Donna Strickland: In high school I think had very good science teachers. There was Ms Bowman in grade 9 whose husband was a chemistry professor and she would spend her summers in her husband’s lab learning the latest in chemistry. I had her for grade 9 science and she would like to have things exploding in the front of her room and she was wonderful in a lot of ways. I had her again for grade 12 chemistry, and she brought in chocolate bars for us one test I had to miss because I was in the high school band, we were had gone to England during the one test. And she just “Before you start you must have your brain working”, and so she gave each a chocolate bar to get our brain working. But also, I must say, Jim Forsythe, was my physics teacher in grade 13 and I was in his homeroom for the entire five years of high school. So, I sat in the physics room, every morning to start the school day. He also is the one who put me on … I’ve been for twenty years on my high school wall of fame and it was my high school physics teacher that did that for me.;20;Mentors (Role models)
Did your mother have an interest in science too?;Donna Strickland: My mother was raised in a small Canadian farm town, she was raised on a farm. She had an older brother and an older sister. The brother inherited the farm and did not go to university, but the two girls and this was back in the 1940s, were both sent to university. The oldest one had thought about going into medicine but switched into nursing and my mother wanted to go into maths and sciences, that was what she was good at. But before her sister went ahead of her, and my mother got advised that as a female she would find going into the sciences is very hard and that she would be better served by going into the arts. So my mother listened to these people, because coming from a town of one thousand, she just felt overwhelmed about the idea, and so she chose to go then into the arts and then regretted it ever after. And then again, I was raised by a very strong woman who made it clear that she wished she had followed her heart and soul and not listened to everybody else.;20;Motivation
When did you first encounter your fellow female Physics Laureates, Marie Curie and Maria Goeppert Mayer?;Donna Strickland: I think Marie Curie is just one those icons that you hear about so I can’t possibly tell you when I would have first heard of her. Maria Goeppert Mayer I didn’t even know was a woman when I cited her in my thesis. I just knew of, you know, Goeppert Mayer’s work and it is very funny that I actually said ‘he’ in my thesis, that is how uneducated I am and one of the people reading, the theorist who would help me at the end, he enjoyably stroke it off and said, “Donna, shame on you”.;20;Creativity
How has being a woman in science changed over the years?;Donna Strickland: I think since Maria Goeppert Mayer has won that there are many more women in science than when she was there. I think the fact that she didn’t get a paying job as a scientist until, I think, the 1950s, when she did her Nobel Prize winning work, is amazing. So, I have been payed all along. I never had a female professor, not as an undergrad, not as a grad student and now there are six of us, I believe, in my department of 40. So that is still only, you know, 15 percent and it is not as high as it should be, but the fact that there are even six women instead of zero is quite a change. So, I think things are changing for women all the time, certainly. I grew up in the 70s and we were all about women’s lib and I remember being told over and over again: “Women, you can do anything”, so it never entered my mind that I couldn’t.;20;Diversity in Science
How can we encourage more women to do science?;Donna Strickland: I think everybody in the world should be told that do what you love and what you think you are good at. I don’t want to really distinguish men from women, I think there are jobs that are stereotypically women jobs and I don’t see any reason that men shouldn’t do those. I don’t think women are more caring than men and yet we hear, you know, so many jobs are for women because they are the more nurturing and I think that’s just as wrong on the other side. So, I think every person should be exposed to every type of field and find out what they are good at and everybody should get to do what they are good at and what they love to do.;20;Diversity in Science
What advice would you give to the younger version of you?;Donna Strickland: I feel like I was born under a lucky star and life just worked out for me. Then I will tell other women who ask me this, because people are always wondering when should you have your children, and I said, you should just do everything when it feels right for you. There is no one life plan that works for everybody. Because my husband and I the first year of marriage actually lived biocoastal – so that we both could have good jobs – that got old fast and so I did give up on the academic track and I took a job as a member of technical staff and it turned out that is was perfect for me because I had my two children. I went through my both pregnancies on that job and I was someone who was nauseous all nine months, all day long and I realized that when I got my first teaching job, which was right after my second child was born, I thought I could not have lectured through those two pregnancies. I could have not stood in front of a classroom, I was so ill trough all those two sets of nine months. So, to me, my life just keeps working out. I thought, maybe I was giving up on my carrier, but I hadn’t and someone at the University of Waterloo was willing to hiring me – after four years being out of the academic track. So, this is what I always tell women, you have to do what is right for you at the time is right for you and hope that life works out. I don’t know, maybe I am the only one born under such a lucky star, but my life seems to keep working.;20;Career Devleopment
How has your career been impacted by being married to another researcher?;Donna Strickland: I think this is the toughest thing about being a female scientist. I think once we become 50/50 women and men, then it won’t be quite the same. But almost every female scientist is married to a male scientist. Male scientists can’t be married to female scientists, there is not enough of us to go around for them. And so, it does bring in the two-body problem. And most couples have to find jobs together, but many other jobs exist in almost every city whereas science jobs only come up rarely, here, there and everywhere. So, if you want to do the type of science you want to do, you have to be willing to look worldwide and so it is very hard for two scientists to find jobs together. And I must say, my husband followed me to Canada and took a job with industry it’s not, wouldn’t have been his choice either. And so, we each took our turn. As he says he has now been 22 years living in my country, near my family, with me doing the job I want to do and I was only four years in New Jersey, near his family, in his country with him doing the job he wanted to do. So, he kind of keeps asking when it is his turn – for me to go back and follow him.;20;Career Devleopment
Why is diversity important in science?;Donna Strickland: I think diversity is a good thing whether you are in science or in anything.  Again, it goes along with not only should every gender be exposed, every person has the right, it shouldn’t be a privilege, it is a right to do what you want to do, and what you are good at and I think, and I’ve said this before, the world works best if we all do what we are good at so that no group of people should ever be discouraged from doing what they are good at- the world works best if we all get our opportunities and we all do it.;20;Diversity in Science
How does it feel to be awarded the Nobel Prize for your very first paper?;Donna Strickland: It is unusual that I am winning Nobel Prize for my very first work. I, you know, call it a one hit wonder quite a bit of the time when I give talks and people always want to hear about this one paper rather then my newer work. It’s unusual, most of the time I think supervisors get the credit for the work, and I also think that Gerard Mourou, my supervisor, deserves more credit, maybe, for this prize than I do, because it was his idea. As the student, it’s my job to take the idea and make it a reality and so a lot of work goes into that. People over the years have said that the students should be credited with the fact that though you are given one grand idea, you still have to figure out all the other details to make the idea work. So, everybody should be rewarded, I think possibly, I am one of the people that are getting rewarded as a student because it was as an individual project and so, there were just the two names on the paper as opposed to a large group of names and therefore, when it is a large group of names, one person represents that group and that one person would have to be the supervisor, so …;20;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How did you find your time as a PhD student?;Donna Strickland: When I went to graduate school, I really went with the attitude that I wanted to do one of the world’s best PhD’s. Now, I didn’t think I was unique in that, I would think that every student going for PhD must hope to do one of the world’s great PhD’s. I don’t think anybody goes to do a PhD for society, to say great job. I think there is many other jobs where your parents are telling you to be a doctor, be a lawyer, there are things, at least, in North American culture which are held up on a pedestal and science isn’t one of them. I think, you go in and do a PhD in science because you just love it and want to do it. And if that is why you are doing it, you just want to do the best. So, there was Gerard’s group, or just a group of fabulous students, and we were all there trying to do the best. I think we all urged each other on and we all helped each other but there was also that competitive spirit in all of us and we all knew the other one was working hard, so we must work hard, but as well when anybody struggled we all figured out a way around each person’s struggle so that they could keep moving forward, so it was, even though I am the only one getting credited, it was quite a team effort.;20;Competencies
How important is collaboration in science?;Donna Strickland: I think that science is a team sport. I think that you have to talk to somebody else about it. It helps you to form your ideas and it also will spark something, especially if you are in a dead end trying to figure it out, there would always has to be these conversations back and forth. Whether it is from student to supervisor, student to student, student to anybody, from scientist to scientist – it just helps to talk about what you are doing.;20;Creativity
Do you enjoy mentoring students?;Donna Strickland: Of course, it’s fun. I particularly like to having students in my group and talking to them and trying get them to see it from their own perspective and get them to the point where they are telling me the new things and that I can learn from them. That is always the goal of every supervisor, to bring your student to the point where they’re letting you know what I should already know, so that’s the joy in it.;20;Motivation
Do you have a favourite piece of advice for students?;Donna Strickland: No, I don’t, I don’t think I have one piece of advice to give to a student. I think each of us is unique and each of us sees it from a different point of view and so, what one person needs, another person doesn’t need. I will tell you though, that quite a long time ago, before I even came to Waterloo, there was a student who was to give a talk, a female student, to give a talk. And this female student was particularly nervous and I pointed out, I said, this is one of the challenges that I think women have to overcome, that boys at the time certainly were raised to have bravado, boys are raised to say “Look what I did”. Boys, whether it’s through sport or anything, they are to stand up and almost be beating themselves on the chest saying, “Look how good”. Women are raised to stay quiet and demure and women are raised to not show off. And I was given this advice early on as well, I said: “No, you must learn that to get your PhD you must be able to stand up and give a talk. And if you’re giving the talk about your research you are basically saying ‘Look at me, this is what I did’”. Now, you don’t say it in those words, but this is why it is harder, quite often, for the females to get up and give effective talks because they want to always be so humble about it and they have to get over that.;20;Advice for young researchers
Is it important for science to be fun?;Donna Strickland: I personally think that, since you spend so many hours a day at work you should, if you have the chance … Unfortunately a lot of people have to work just to get a pay-check, but scientists do not. Scientists are doing it – they could do something else that would make the more money, so I think if you don’t love what you are doing, you are not going to be doing it. That’s all, I think. You can call it fun, you can call it excitement or you can call it enjoyable – I call it fun.;20;Motivation
Why do you enjoy science?;Donna Strickland: For me the fun of science is that even though there’s a lot of hard work to get an experiment to happen and then you can spend … The one that I am being awarded for took a year of work to get done. But there is something so exciting about data being shown on a screen or a laser that you have been trying to struggle to make work, finally it works, and you see it. And laser physics is one that you actually see happening. There is all kind of things when you see one colour of light change to another colour of light or what have you that’s exciting to see. And brand-new data that you know you have, and other people don’t have – it’s such an exciting feeling. That’s why, I just think it is fun. And I like building, I have said before, Lego was one of my favourite toys growing up and so building lasers, falls under that category of feeling like a toy, you’re simply playing with a new thing.;20;Motivation
What application from your discovery are you most proud of?;Donna Strickland: There was only one commercial application of this laser jet and that is cutting or machining of transparent material, it can be glass used on a cell phone, it can be the cornea of your eye. That’s the one application and I was actually quite surprised that started just 10 years later after the laser was built. It’s usually takes a little bit longer from a research tool in the lab to become an actual product, so I am surprised by that. But I think going forward, the exciting one would be if we can actually get laser acceleration to work. There is a number of people working on laser acceleration, I myself not at this point, but I think if  can start to either compete with the hospital accelerators so it could be used for medicine or even the large CERN – that would be the exciting one I think.;20;Creativity
Is it important for scientists to do work that impacts society?;Donna Strickland: No, I don’t feel that the work you do should be directly applicable to society. Again, it falls under my idea that we should all do what we’re good at and I don’t think everyone of us is good in taking an idea out to there or knowing what society should do, but again it goes back to the facts that the scientists have to constantly have dialogues and so it’s a whole train of people. And it doesn’t matter if it is something to be used for society or just an application for whatever. It’s a nonstop continuum people working together. So hopefully there’s other people that are looking at this who want to help society and work back to find the right things.;20;Roles of Science
How did it feel to discover you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Donna Strickland: I think it’s a shock, it’s a stunning shock to be woken up to be told that you are Nobel Prize winner. Again, this work was done over thirty years ago so it’s not something that I am living and breathing every day that I did pulse amplification for my PhD all those years ago. No one is expecting, in my position, to win a Nobel Prize. So you get woken up at 5:00 in the morning. My husband is closer to our landline phone that is in our bedroom and so he answered the phone. And certainly, in the middle of the night when you get woken up, it is usually a fear thing, that someone has been hurt. So, I’m saying “What is it, what is it?” and he goes “They’re asking for Professor Strickland”. So, then you kind of know that no time am I called ‘Professor Strickland’, even usually at the university and then this is an important call from Sweden and then you are put on hold, although actually they hung up on me. But I thought I was on hold, I’m hanging on to this call, it’s from Sweden and it’s October 2nd and I think I won the Nobel Prize, this can’t really be true. So that’s all it feels like, this can’t be true.;20;Impact of Nobel on you
How did your friends and family react?;Donna Strickland: So many things. My daughter … I texted four people before the press conference and after I’d received the call. I texted my brother, my sister, my son and my daughter. I knew that my brother and sister would get it right away. My sister was in Europe, so would be the daytime and my brother wakes up. I know my two kids were not get it right away and the funniest one was my daughter, who unfortunately had her e-mail hacked in the summer before this, so when she got the text saying, all I said was “I won the Nobel Prize”, she goes, “Oh, mom’s phone had been hacked”. And even her girlfriend called her and said “Congratulations on the Nobel Prize”. And she goes, “No, my mother’s phone has been hacked”. She had to be told it’s in the news, so then she googled, and she was just, she was in tears, screaming at me in the phone call. So that was exciting. I think at my press conference at the university the first day my entire department showed up and the former chair of the department who I was associate chair under, stood up to congratulate me on behalf of all of them. He almost had me in tears because that’s when I really looked, I think I was like a deer caught in the headlights with so many cameras on me. I had never faced such a thing before and when I looked at each face, they were just all beaming at me. It was almost too much.;20;Family/Home Environment
How has the Nobel Prize affected your life so far?;Donna Strickland: My life got turned upside down with winning the Nobel Prize. I now realise, I don’t think at the time, I realised how reclusive I was and how much I enjoyed spending time all by myself until I found out that was not something possible after winning the Nobel Prize and that all of sudden, people want my autograph and people want to take selfies with me or, you know, like I said everybody in my department, now when they see me, a big smile comes on their face and yet, it’s like really ‘cause you have known me for so many years’. So things are very different for me, I kind of hope they go back to just that normal way. I don’t think people can live on this height of excitement for very long, but it has been quite different for the last two months.;20;Impact of Nobel prize on you
What qualities are needed to be a successful scientist?;Donna Strickland: A scientist needs, first curiosity, they need to be excited about trying to learn something different. They have to be able to communicate well to be a good scientist, because you do have to talk back and forth so that you get these new ideas. I think an experimental physicist needs incredibly patience. And so, some students try it for a while and realise they simply don’t have the patience to do that kind of work and then of course things break, and you have to start again, and it can lead to a lot of frustration. So, you have to have that kind of patience, but again, if it’s work you enjoy it is not as hard as it is although frustration is still hard to deal with.;20;Competencies
How do you deal with scientific challenges?;Donna Strickland: I’m somebody who knows what I am trying to get to at the end of my project, so it doesn’t matter how many hurdles get thrown in. Soon it’s another hurdle one must figure its way around, it but that is a job of a scientist. Usually the hurdles are a technical challenge or a scientific obstacle that you weren’t expecting, but the that is was science is about. If you already knew how everything worked, you wouldn’t have to do the project to start with. So, each one is a new puzzle and you have to … To me I just think of it like a puzzle rather than a problem, but then I also like to work on projects that not very many people are working on rather than being part of the race. So, this is why I have not worked on chirped pulse amplification (CPA) as much. I have two assistants in my lab, but I look for projects that I find really fun to do, but the whole rest of the world aren’t necessarily doing them, so I don’t ever feel that I am in a time race.;20;Creativity
Can you explain your Nobel Prize-awarded discovery in 30 seconds or less?;Donna Strickland: In 30 seconds might be very hard. This is a way to make sure that you can have very intense pulses and the idea is like, I call it, a laser hammer and that if you can push on a nail with all your might it won’t go into a piece of wood, but if you hit it with a hammer quickly it goes in. And this is the idea that we can we make our laser pulse both energetic and short, but we didn’t have the hammer inside the laser destroying the laser, which was why it never worked before. But we can do it in a way that the laser was fine and then make the pulse short after amplification so that could be like a laser hammer.;20;Research

Why did you decide to become a physicist?;"Kip S. Thorne: I grew up in Logan, Utah, which is high in the Rocky Mountains, altitude nearly 2,000 meters. We had deep snow when I was growing up so obviously, and before I was eight years old, I wanted to be a driver of a snow plow because you could push the snow to such great heights. But then when I was eight my mother took me to a lecture about astronomy, about the solar system, and I became very excited about the idea of the solar system, so she did some projects with me about astronomy. And I started doing reading on my own, decided I wanted to be an astronomer.
But then when I was thirteen I found in the big city, Salt Lake City, a great big city, about a hundred thousand at the time, I found a little paperback book called ‘One two three infinity’ by a physicist cosmologist named George Gamow, and it described ideas for mathematics and theoretical physics and cosmology that I found even more exciting than astronomy, and so at age thirteen I decided I wanted to be a physicist but I would work on things connected with astronomy and so here I am.";23;Motivation
What do you enjoy about science?;Kip S. Thorne: The most enjoyable part of science is doing it. It is sometimes very hard, sometimes very frustrating but extremely rewarding when you suddenly understand something. It is an adrenaline rush when you suddenly understand something. It does not matter very much whether somebody else has understood it first or not. It is nice if you are the first person, but just to suddenly understand a puzzle that you have been struggling with for a long time is just fabulous. And it is remarkable that we as humans are capable of understanding the physical world around us in such detail that we can predict things that turn out to be true, that we can understand things that are very far from earth, such as the black holes that we have described colliding with gravitational waves. And that we can use the understanding we develop in the physical laws for technology for human benefit, so that aspect of it also is really quite wonderful. The power of science for understanding and for technology. But personally, the joy of discovery is the big deal.;23;Motivation
How important are imagination and creativity?;Kip S. Thorne: Imagination and creativity are really very crucial, particularly for the big leaps of understanding. But they are far from enough, because you may have imagination and creativity and suddenly think you understand something far beyond the frontiers of current knowledge, but you will usually be wrong, and you validate this through experiment and you validate it also by seeing how it fits into the well-established laws of nature and how it fits logically into this complex structure of all the well-established laws of nature. So you really, in order to validate the insights, you have to use these two additional things, experiment and detailed mathematical analysis.;23;Environment
Who are your biggest influences?;Kip S. Thorne: There are a number of people that have influenced me and how I think and work as a physicist. John Wheeler, who is my PhD mentor and was a tremendous inspiration. We had very different views about the political world, but we were very much of the same mind about how you understand nature. And I learned so much from him, he was a professor at Princeton. Also at Princeton was Robert Dicke who is a superb experimental physicist who was a mentor to Ray Weiss, my colleague on the LIGO project. And I was there studying about black holes with John Wheeler and gravitational waves and also participating in the research group meetings of Robert Dicke, and I was learning about how experimental physics is done through Robert Dicke and his research group and Ray Weiss. So those two were among the handful of people who profoundly influenced me.;23;Mentor(Role Models)
Which Nobel Laureates inspire you?;Kip S. Thorne: Among the Nobel Laureates my colleagues that with whom I am receiving this prize. Actually, Barry Barish and Rainer Weiss and I are icons for a very large experimental team of a thousand people in LIGO. That team is so superb, but the people that really have inspired me working with them  are Weiss, Barish and Ronald Drever, who is no longer with us, he has passed away, whom I have worked with intensely on this. Also Robbie Vogt who was the first director of LIGO and helped us in the first step in the transition from a set of ideas into the real world of where LIGO is today.;23;Mentors (Role models)
How important is collaboration?;"Kip S. Thorne: Let me describe my personality. I am a person who likes to work on science quietly by myself or with one or two students, maybe a postdoctoral student. I am an introverted. I behave like an extrovert, I learned how to do that, but I am fundamentally an introvert. I get the greatest pleasure from that kind of work. But LIGO could only be done as a big collaboration, there was no other way to do it. So I gritted my teeth and I plunged into this and helped in every way that I possibly could to lay foundations for LIGO and to help Barry Barish wherever he needed any help from me. Grow LIGO from a small experimental project that I began with Ronald Drever at Caltech, and Ray Weiss at MIT, a small collaboration into what it is today. It could only be done as a big collaboration. It is so difficult, the things that go wrong are such number of different things it requires large numbers of experts and a variety of different pieces of physics and engineering to pull it off.
LIGO is the triumph of a thousand people, the superb experimental team. I think my biggest contribution was to understand where they had to go because I am a theorist and I knew about how strong the waves were. I understand how they interact with the detector, I understood what needed to be done. There is no way I could do any of that, but I could also convey to the funding agencies and the science community my faith in the experimental team and I could explain why I had faith in the experimental team, so that was probably my biggest contribution, to convince funding agency and physicists that this should go forward. It is a strange kind of a role but I think without that role it would probably not have happened.";23;Creativity
How important is government support?;Kip S. Thorne: For a project of this sort the only way it could be done was through a governmental agency. It was a project that cost up until now about 1.1 billion dollars. It is a lot of money. Not as much as some of the very biggest physics projects but by far, I think, the largest thing that the National Science Foundation in the US has ever done. It was absolutely crucial. So this really was a collaboration, initially between Caltech led by Ronald Drever and me, MIT led by Rainer Weiss and the National Science Foundation were the key person was Richard Isaacson who was our programme director, who himself had made an enormous breakthrough in the theory of gravitational waves, had solved a problem that had puzzled everybody from Einstein on for decades. How is energy carried by gravitational waves? This was Isaacson who turned into government funding agent and he understood how things worked in Washington and he understood what we were doing because he is such as superb physicist himself. He was really the additional person who pulled this off. Without the National Science Foundation and Isaacson this would never, never have happened.;23;Environment
Can breakthroughs in physics still be done independently?;Kip S. Thorne: You need to work on a breakthrough problem with whatever kind of team is optimal. And in many areas of physics a very small team is optimal. That is true particularly in condensed matter physics. It was true on this year’s chemistry Nobel Prize which was done by physicists. It is true in last year’s physics Nobel Prize and so I would say the majority of breakthrough work can still be done in small teams but there are certain things, and gravitational waves is one, that can only be done in a big collaboration. We in the physics community have learned, I think, how to function side by side as colleagues with some people working in huge teams, like LIGO with a thousand people, and others who are working in the manner that I prefer to work myself, in a very small effort with just one or two or three professors and a small number of students and postdoctoral students. Both are needed depending on the problem.;23;Future Research
Do you enjoy being a mentor?;Kip S. Thorne: My mentoring has been one of my greatest joys. I am proud that I have mentored fifty something, fifty-two or fifty-four, I do not even know the number, PhD students during my career and that they have gone in huge number of different directions because I mentored them broadly so that they had the tools to be able to work in anything from an analyst at the CIA on one extreme, to a very abstract theoretical physics, another extreme, in the computer industry, in management. I had a student, two students who moved into the financial world very, very successfully. And they look back and they say far more useful to them than Harvard Business School, which was a key piece for what they wanted to do, was doing a theoretical physics PhD under me. Because in doing a theoretical physics PhD they learned how to take a complex problem, break it down into pieces that could be solved, how to transform a problem into a soluble form, and that general skill that is the essence of success in physics is transferable into all these different areas of human enterprise. So yes, I am proud of my mentoring and I have taken great joy in it.;23;Motivation
What is your favourite piece of advice for students?;"Kip S. Thorne: I have several favourite bits of advice. The one that I gave particularly to my granddaughter who is a physics PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University now. I told her when she said she wanted to be a physicist I said physics is a great springboard from which you can move in many directions, so fine, but you have to find a direction that you absolutely love. Because if you are going to spend a large portion of your life on something it has to be something you love. It also should be something that is important, something that can help the world, but you have to love it and this advice that I got from my own grandfather when I was about four or five years old. He told me, Kip, if you will succeed in life if you find a job that is like play. So that is one thing, you have to be willing to, ready to, eager to work very, very hard. It does not come easily. So that is the second piece of crucial advice.
Third piece of advice is you find your own way of functioning. My mind is much slower than most of my colleagues’ minds and I discovered that when I was an undergraduate. I struggled for the first year and a half as an undergraduate at Caltech where I spent most of my subsequent career, but I developed my own ways of learning things. Keeping records of what I was learning, working things out in my own way, and notebooks and so forth, that enabled me to achieve despite having a slow working mind. So I advise students, you find your own way, and you have to experiment of mastering material and your own directions that you can be successful in and everybody is different. We can all succeed in different ways.";23;Advice for young researchers
How did you become interested in movies?;"Kip S. Thorne: Almost everything that I have done was something I never planned to do. That was true of LIGO, gravitational waves. I have watched through my entire career, my lifetime particularly as an adult, for opportunities, unexpected opportunities and that’s just basically what gravitational waves were. I came along at just the right time to do this together with Barish and Weiss and I jumped on the opportunity once I saw that it had a real possibility to succeed. Similarly, I never intended to be involved in movies, but I was single in southern California for about nine years and I dated in Hollywood and one of the people that I dated was a woman named Lynda Obst. She was a movie producer, had just arrived in Hollywood at the time that I was single and so our romance never went anywhere because perhaps I was too much of a nerd for her and she was perhaps too intense for me, but we became very close friends and she is a close friend of my wife Carolee as well today.
Many years later Lynda telephoned me, and she said Do you want to brainstorm with me for a movie? I thought for a very short time and said Yes. I could see immediately, one it would be fun, I would be working with brilliant people who were very different from me and that is particularly fun. And I would have a possibility to convey through a Hollywood movie the beauties and power of science to an audience what turned out to be about a hundred million people who bought a ticket to this movie. How else can a professor reach a hundred million people? So I said Yes. We brainstormed and we created the ideas for a movie, and she brought Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan on board to write the screen play and direct it. They completely changed our story but kept all the science that we put into the movie. It turned out to be a wonderful collaboration between me and these filmmakers about a movie in which the movie is really based on and steeped in real science.";23;Motivation
Is popular culture an important way to educate audiences?;Kip S. Thorne: Popular culture has tremendous potential for inspiring people about real science. I do not know how effective we can be about educating people about real science. Interstellar was not an education process it was more of an inspiration process. I wrote a book to go along with the movie called ‘The Science of Interstellar’ which is my attempt to provide education in addition. But I think popular culture can provide tremendous inspiration about science and can convey some of the ethos of science but hard to convey the basic ideas with any precision obviously.;23;Creativity
What is your favourite film?;Kip S. Thorne: I think my two favourite films were not necessarily scientific, were the two that preceeded mine, that were also, had the science built into them from the beginning, ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’, where a physicist Arthur C Clarke provided the underpinnings for it. It was Stanley Kubrick’s film and then the movie ‘Contact’ where Carl, which was a collaboration between Carl Sagan and Lynda Obst, the same woman that I collaborated with to make ‘Interstellar’. It is the beginning for that film it was Carl Sagan’s film and, in both cases, again the science was embedded so deeply it was inextricably interwoven with the film and I have loved that.;23;Free time
Has working in films helped your own research?;"Kip S. Thorne: In small ways but not major ways. In ‘Interstellar’ I worked very closely with a visual effects team with computer graphics people at the company Double Negative were the lead person is Paul Franklin, who got the Academy Award for the visual effects in ‘Interstellar’. And in order to make the beautiful images of the black hole, gas around the black hole, a swirling gas around the black hole, the wormhole in that film, it was necessary to create a whole new way of going from a computer simulation to visuals on a screen.
Oliver James, who is the chief scientist at Double Negative, and I worked out this new method to do it which was necessary because you could not get the high resolution smooth images that were required for this science fiction movie in any other way. But the methods that we devised are now being used by astrophysicists as part of their visualization of simulations they do of things like black holes and accretion discs around black holes and neutron stars colliding neutron stars and so forth. So there is a feedback in that sense but I think beyond that the direction of the feeding is largely from the science into the film and through that to a popular culture.";23;Creativity
How do you like to spend your free time?;Kip S. Thorne: You know, my current career that interface with arts, the arts which is not just movies. It is music with Hans Zimmer and visual effects, multimedia, concerts, it is a book I am working on with my poetry and paintings by a superb young painter. My new career is my hobby in some sense. I thoroughly enjoy these interfaces with the arts. But also my wife and I just enjoy each other and we have a wonderful time. In very extreme moderation, we do not have that much time for it, but we hike, we scuba dive and we ski but not very much in the last few years. The last few years have just been too hectic.;23;Free time
Where do you do your best thinking?;Kip S. Thorne: The kind of work that I do, whether it is working on a movie searching for ideas for a movie or in physics, I collect information, problems, issues that I am struggling with during the day. Day after day and I may be struggling with some issue. How do you depict something in a movie? Or how do you solve a particular physics problem? I may collect all this information related to it during the day for a few days. Then in the middle of the night the inspiration comes, somehow things connect together in the middle of the night. I get up going to the bathroom and write notes and go back to bed. Usually the notes are fairly coherent and often they have the key idea that I could not get in any other way. My mind has to go more or less blank and things have to just somehow naturally start fitting themselves together and in a semi-conscious state and that is where the inspirations come.;23;Environment
What projects are you working on now?;"Kip S. Thorne: Gravitational waves are a tool to explore what I like to call the warped side of the universe. These are objects and phenomena, they are not made from matter like you and I and people watching this video, but instead are made from warp space and warp time. A black hole is the prime example. Black hole is made from warped space and the diameter of black hole is huge compared to the circumference whereas normally circumference is bigger. Time slows to a halt near the surface of a black hole. You see this in ‘Interstellar’ where Cooper’s daughter Murph, Cooper being Matthew McConaughey, Murph being Jessica Chastain. Daughter Murph ages from age eleven to ninety-five while Cooper ages hardly at all because Cooper goes near a black hole where time slows. So near a black hole time slows down. Inside a black hole time flows in a direction you would have thought was a space direction toward the centre but that is the direction time flows.
Black holes drag space into whirling motion like the errand or tornado. So black hole is made from warped space and time. Colliding black holes create a veritable storm in the fabric of space and time. There are other phenomena on the warped side of the universe, the birth of the universe itself. The earliest moments of the universe space and time tremendously warped. Things called cosmic strings where the circumference around this sort of rubber band like object is less than π times the diameter. And these weird things that are made of space and time are a wonderful topic for a book about the warped side of the universe.
This book is a collaboration between Lia Halloran who is a young painter and photographer who is good enough to have sold pieces to the Guggenheim Museum in New York. She is in her thirties and so it is her paintings of these phenomena, the storm and the fabrics of space and time to produces gravitational waves, cosmic streams, that produce gravitational waves. Her paintings and my poetry about it, so I never shown anybody except my wife hardly any of my poetry. My attempts of poetry, if my poetry is so bad that it makes this book be a total loser and does not sell but two copies one to her and one to me, well that is alright. I have had success elsewhere and if I drag her down that is alright. She has had success elsewhere, so we are having fun doing something that is different for us. Perhaps people will enjoy it. I enjoy the process very much of working with creative people who are very different than I am and trying to do something different from what I have done before.";23;Research
What do you find harder – poetry or physics?;Kip S. Thorne: Right now for me writing poems is a lot harder than doing physics because it is new. That is why I am doing it. I have done physics for most of my life, I have been doing physics in a serious sort of way for more than half a century and so let’s do something different. That is also very hard because I am very new at it. So that is the challenge and that is the joy.;23;Creativity
I noticed that you brought an artefact for the museum, what is it?;"Duncan Haldane: Well, when I initiated the work, which this prize was given for, one of the two works which I received this prize for took a long time for to be published, because it was actually contradicting conventional wisdom at the time. Perhaps I didn’t explain it clearly enough, but in any case, this paper was rejected by a number of journals. And in fact, the original arguments which I discovered that magnetic chains had what we now know is a topological phase, when the quantum spin with an integer-spin, but not a half-integer-spin, which was … no one had thought that was an important feature. Why I discovered this really accidentally, I mean I, as a consequence of another piece of work I had done earlier. And it turned out that people’s understanding of magnetic chains was confused and that there were two sources of it.
One was kind of that semiclassical picture that thought of spins like little compasses, little arrows, that pointed and wanted to be parallel/antiparallel. And that works very well in high dimensions when long-range order occurs at low temperatures. But it was actually when it had been known mathematically that a one-dimensional chain, a very long, thin chain of atoms couldn’t, it ought to be destroyed by quantum mechanical fluctuations at any finite temperature, but also at zero temperature. On the other hand, there was a mathematically exact solution of a toy model, that Hans Bethe had discovered, before he went on to, you know, do huge work in understanding why the sun, how the sun works, and working on nuclear energy. But his early work on magnetic chains had this interesting solution which he guessed, and it turned out to be correct. And he probably didn’t understand why it worked, because he thought he would apply the same methods to higher dimensional magnets, and he promised that in his original paper. But of course, it turns out that what he’d locked on to, involves some very deep mathematics that took about 50 years to understand.
So, most of the scientists who work in magnetism, they knew of the existence of Bethe’s exact solution for a chain of magnetic atoms where the spin took the smallest possible value of 1/2, and locked superficially exactly like the spin wave theories that worked for, that were basically semiclassical, that worked in higher dimensions. And so, they assumed that ok, there was a little kind of, some kind of technical problem with the spin wave theory, but it had to be morally correct; the detail, this little problem didn’t really matter. But they were completely wrong, because the resemblance was purely superficial, and we now know that Bethe’s solution describes very interesting excitations which you call ‘spinons’ now, that it should carry spin-1/2 why the spin wave would carry spin-1, and they got nothing, it’s just an accidental coincidence of the formulas.
I actually, by covering this from a completely different angle, which was that there had been a, again going back to the 30ies, a remarkable relation between fermions and spins, a spin-1/2 object could take two possible states; up and down. And if I have an orbital which you can put a fermion in, it can either be empty or filled, and there is a kind of mapping between the two. But fermions, they have this fundamental property that if you exchange two of them you get a minus one sign, so fermions are said to … the operators that create them are said to anti-commute well. You get a minus sign if you add or remove them in different orders, while the spins don’t have that. But Jordan and Wigner in the 30ies had discovered a nice little way to map the two by putting in, what’s now called a string, in front of the things in the operator. So, they had a remarkable relation between spins and fermions that worked. So, it was pointed out that you could map the spin half chain problem that Bethe solved into a problem involving fermions. And at some limit these were non-interacting fermions, so you could understand the thing.
Based on that language, a completely different language, which I had followed on some work that Alan Luther and Vic Emery and I guess Luther and Ingo Peschel had done in the early 70ies. This allowed one to calculate things – not exactly – but in an approximate method. While the Bethe solution, the one that gave you the energy levels, no one at that point had ever worked out how to calculate anything else out of these very complicated wavefunctions that Bethe gets. It took another, probably 20 years, before, finally the solution of how to calculate with Bethe’s solution was found. So, using these methods, which a normal physicist, who isn’t a very abstract mathematician, could actually do a calculation. So, in this language of the fermions, I made a kind of theory called ‘Luttinger liquids’, which gave a general scheme for what interacting fermions should do in one dimension, and then applied it to this spin-1/2 model. So, Luther and Peschel had made a large progress in the spin-1/2 model; by treating it as a fermion field theory we could actually do a calculation.
But they had missed a detail, which was if the spins like to be in the line plane, like compass needles, you could treat it easily this way, because one of the limits is non-interacting fermions. But the interactions in the fermion picture when the spin is to stand vertically upwards and down, like point towards the North pole or South pole, and they’d missed out why the transition happens at a certain point. From doing numerical calculations, in fact, by applying my general theory to the Bethe “Ansatz” solutions, I saw within them exactly what had been missed. And so, it gave me the understanding of how to properly do a treatment of spins. And then I could actually treat any spin, not just spin-1/2, and immediately I did it. I found that in fact, using arguments based on what Kosterlitz and Thouless had done, that the conventional argument was just wrong. And something quite different happened for the next spin up, spin 1, and all spins which were integer values rather than half-integer values. So, that was it. In fact, this paper states the first lines of stating that, you know, this leads to a very unexpected conclusion; that the spin-1 chains behave completely different from what the Bethe “Ansatz” solution said/did, and it was nothing to do with the spin waves.
So, this was kind of against the orthodoxy … because a lot of people … I mean spin chains were kind of obscure, but in the 70ies a lot of people started working on them because there was some possibility of actually making materials that did this. And, in fact, spin chains had grown a lot of current research on understanding how thermal equilibration happens; people are using spin chains for all kind of things now. But, anyway, this started getting popular, but I was unable to get this published. I sent it to one journal, got turned down with three dismissive reports. So, I just sent it to another one, and I got essentially, I don’t know if it went to the same referees, but essentially, I got the same kind of reports back. So, it took another couple of years, to get the thing published, I mean I, perhaps I didn’t explain it in the language that these people could understand. But in fighting these referees’ reports, I rephrased the arguments in a much more, perhaps, a better way. But the original way I discovered this got completely lost from it. So, this paper was actually, was referred to in the literature because people went on and basically validated the results in here.
There wasn’t an archive at those times, and somehow, I, in moving around, I didn’t have this paper. The people who worked on this problem, and actually validated that I had found what they referred to, that they never had any copies anymore. The institute in Grenoble, the institute in Laue-Langevin, where I did this work, there was an official number of pre-print, but of course they had cleaned out all their cabinets. And I was searching in the boxes in my basement. In fact, the Swedish television people wanted me to meet to show them the boxes, because I have a problem with throwing out papers. So, I have lots of boxes, unopened boxes, which had accompanied me in various moves that was accumulated, and I thought that it might be in there. But in fact, a Hungarian physicist Jenő Sólyom, who worked this problem, eventually came up with the missing pre-print. So, it was actually very interesting cause it actually, it does make a connection that I had forgotten about completely with the work of Kosterlitz and Thouless.
Initially you wouldn’t even think there was a connection because their work was based on, essentially, classical problem of a super fluid film in two dimensions. And Kosterlitz, when he talks about this, he makes it clear that he just deals with classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics introduces too many complications. But, in fact there is a remarkable relation between two special dimensions and one space- and one time-dimension, which is kind of like the relation between relativity in space-time; three space dimensions and one time-, and you get the four-dimensional space-time continuum. Well, a one-dimensional system, where you have a one-dimensional space-time continuum, one plus one dimensional, you have time and space. And there is a remarkable mapping that maps statistic, classical, statistical mechanics of systems at finite temperature described by the Boltzmann factor, with probability weight, and quantum mechanics, which is described by an amplitude for a process to happen. So, the vortices in two dimensions, which if you wonder around the vortex, the spins rotate by two π, turns into, in one space-time dimension, what’s called an “instanton” process, or “tunnelling” process, where, if the spins are all kind of untwisted at one time, and they twist through one turn around a plane and a second plane, and if I do a walk in space time around that, the spin rotates by two π. But the remarkable thing is that quantum mechanics is far richer than the statistical mechanics, cause in the Boltzmann’s formulation of statistical mechanics, the weight factor, the probability factor is always positive. Probabilities, in classical mechanics, are positive, where in quantum mechanics, there are in general complex numbers. But if there is some kind of time-reversal-invariance property, they can be their real numbers, which are plus or minus. But, when things can be both plus or minus, when you combine them, they can cancel, which cannot happen in that.
So, it turned out that the basic process, which should be, the general process was the one I discovered, and the spin-1/2 was a very special case, which was behaving differently, so, the question was not why the spin-1s behave differently from the spin-1/2s, but why the spin-1/2s behaved the way they did. And that’s basically because there was a minus one factor when cancel things. So, this relation to Kosterlitz-Thouless was actually how I realised the thing is a mapping from the classical Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in two dimensions, to the quantum version, in one plus one, which has been incredibly fruitful for all the people working in one-dimensional systems too. So, despite Kosterlitz’s disembowel of quantum mechanics, in his work it has actually been very important also in quantum mechanics. So, this paper has that in it, and as to say, the published version, which is two years later, that connection was completely lost. So, it’s very interesting to remember this and how I discovered things. I was very pleased that someone finally, after I had drawn a blank everywhere, for copies of my own work …";25;Donation
"Did you ever doubt yourself; did you think that you must have made a mistake or must be wrong?";"Duncan Haldane: No, I was always confident. I mean people were kind of telling me things like this is a … some referee reports were saying this was obviously wrong and in complete contradiction to fundamental principles of physics, such as continuity, or something like that. About that time … and other people called this the ‘Haldane conjecture’, I never, actually I looked in the paper and I used the word ‘conjecture’ about some other tiny detail, which is not the main thing. Somehow this got built as, not a prediction or a theory, but a conjecture – as if it was a guess, a speculation. And of course, it wasn’t. But sometime around that time, the Bethe’s method was applied to a modified spin-1 chain. In fact, two authors in the Soviet Union seemed to have found this spin-1 chain solution about the same time. So, there was two versions of this, and I was the referee of both, actually. And I guess they, of course, found something that looked very much like the exact solution of the spin-1/2 chain. But it wasn’t solving the regular problem, there was a slightly modified problem; an extra piece was added on. And, I suppose I might have had about ten minutes worth of soul-searching when I got the first of these to referee.
But finally, I realised that they were doing a slightly modified problem that was special. And in fact, that turned out to be the case; that if you add this extra piece to the problem, and vary in strength; if you switch it to zero – nothing, it’s the same as what I predicted, but as you switch it up, there’s a critical point at which a phase transition to another kind of state, called the dimary state happens. The solvable, the models aren’t exactly solved by Bethe’s method; they’re usually special, and this one was exactly on a critical point. Now, it turned out that these models were extremely interesting for conformal field theories, which were turned out. So, lot of developments happened in this whole business. And those were very interesting models, but they weren’t generic case, so, I suppose I had ten minutes worth of doubt. But I quickly recovered. It was so clear to me that I couldn’t quite understand why people wouldn’t appreciate my arguments. But maybe we feel that we are clearer than we really are …";25;Creativity
Is there any person that you have worked with that has been a huge inspiration for you?;"Duncan Haldane: I was very fortunate to work with Philip Anderson, who was a 1977 Laureate in Physics, or one of the three. In fact, he got the Nobel Prize with his graduate advisor, Van Vleck. So, I guess that puts a big pressure on my students to make sure they don’t break the chain, right? So, he had a very unorthodox way of thinking, and maybe that rubbed off on me in some way. I mean, I was extremely inspired by the way he thought about things. I think obviously that was a big influence on the way I developed as a physicist that I had a good chance to interact with Philip Anderson, who has done an amazing amount of different things. With Philip, the Nobel Prize he got wasn’t for the thing he did which was the best; a bit like Einstein, who got the Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect and not for the gravitational theories.";25;Mentors (Role models)
What do you feel, do you feel that you’ve gotten the prize for the thing you are most proud of?;"Duncan Haldane: Well, I’m proud of a number of things. I guess I, this was interesting; it’s probably only in the magnetic chain stuff I always felt was ok, it was interesting, but it didn’t have any obvious applications. It was maybe changing what you thought about things, but more of a kind of theorist thing, right? But it was interesting to a special … some set of people. But a lot of people were very impressed by it. I suppose, partly because … if a lot of people had post it, they had to say, well, it was either, if it was obvious – it meant they were stupid. So, I had to be brilliant instead, to have discovered it, I suppose. But no, I’ve done a number of things, but, the general theme I think, has been this topological matter. And, the other piece of work I did, which was to find, to realise, that you could have a quantum Hall effect without a magnetic field, just due to some kind of magnetic interactions in the system. It is potentially a very practical, useful thing. But it has taken some time to actually be creative in real materials. You know, it doesn’t really matter to me what they gave it for I suppose. It’s kind of a great honour, and it is great for our field, actually.
What I think has happened is that, when I look back and see what, the way I was taught about physics, in the 70ies, and the way that condensed matter was feud by people. I think, my advisor Phil Anderson, were one of the few people who took a very different view point. But the way we think about it has just changed. The things that went in the textbooks, that people thought were important, they’re kind of just rather boring details. And all the new stuff is absolutely absent. So, it’s been a, you know, great honour I think to be involved in laying the groundwork for this complete change of the way we look at things. So, I suppose that’s probably why this prize has happened. And partly because of what happened about ten years ago; some of this work was generalised to so called “time-reversal-invariant topological insulators”. It suddenly turned out that there were real topological materials that had been sitting on people’s shelves for many years without being noticed. And, just the power of theoretical ideas to, reveal something, very worthy, big calculators and experimentalism that’s just not noticed, it’s amazing, right?
So, it’s a question of really, I think we need the imagination to see what quantum mechanics can do, and we need to understand all about quantum mechanics, it’s laws, but we don’t really understand this potential. In the past things were studied by basically hitting them with a hammer, but now we have arrived at where we are actually able to try and tweak or nudging things around, and understand how quantum mechanics influences what happens. And I think my basic line on this, is that quantum mechanics does stuff much cooler than we could’ve even imagined, and part of this emerges, part of this work. And much more, cooler, things have been emerging since then. And people have dreams of quantum computers and all kinds of quantum information technologies and things. And I am not sure what’s going to happen, but something’s going to happen, because so many people now are looking at this, and it has really become … I mean, once you’ve got real things, then people start taking it seriously. And it has become incredibly inspirational and exciting to lots of young people. And everywhere one sees, an experimentalist gives a talk and he views a little video of a coffee cup turning into a doughnut and backwards, a physicist, and you can find this on YouTube and …
The idea that topology has something to do with this material – it just, makes such a big impact on people. It’s just incredible how this thing has taken off. So, these ideas were kind of a sleeper for a long time, and it’s really the final thing where you’ve taken – it’s got three mathematical backgrounds to it, which, you know, I don’t really understand. But, I understand some of it, but just knowing the abstract mathematics doesn’t lead to something either. The mathematics was actually around for a very long time, since the 40ies, and it was only when some mathematician realised, the mathematical physicist realised, that, the formulas for example that David Thouless, and Kohmoto, Nightingale and den Nijs had found, were actually, they found that this topological, this number that didn’t change, and it was recognised, oh this is Chern’s integral of a curvature of a manifold, right?
Once you kind of name the mathematics, then of course there’s lots of tools around. But to actually find it, you’ll have actually be able to do, a concrete little, what they call a toy model calculation. So, the mathematics is often too abstract to actually pin down. But in what I have done, and what Thouless did, is to be able to do very simple calculations, that you can actually do, preverbally on the back on an envelope. Perhaps you’ll need a computer a little bit to do something simple. But to actually see what a model does you need to strip all the irrelevant details out of something and go down to the simplest, possible model, that contains the physics that you’re interested in, right. And I take this line in seminars that it is almost like contract law. Because if you have a contract, very often it’s got a little phrase in it that says that “anything that’s not written in this contract cannot be considered to be part of it” and the contract is the entire document, right? Once you’ve got your model down to be very simple, and it still exhibits the physics you are after, then it’s not omissible to discuss, to attempt to use anything if you have already thrown away as part of the explanation of the thing. So, this is a technique to getting down to the cleanest, simplest example of things. Then, if you can actually do a calculation, then you can be concrete. And then maybe you can see how it works with the deep and beautiful mathematics that gets exhibited in the actual solution.
But the final thing you need, on top of that, is  once you have actually shown it can be made in a model, in a toy model, it’s remarkable that the material science has got to the point where, if you think it can be made, someone’s going to make it. Before the toy models were attempts to make, you know, text-book thing for modelling complicated real matter, and the large school of ab initio calculation, to get everything right, all the details right. And of course, the people who worked on that, often had a poor opinion of toy models. But it turns out they missed all these fundamentally, simple and beautiful things. So, toy models are great, but once someone actually makes it, then you got the three ingredients; you got the mathematics, calculation that a kind of ‘simple working physicist’ can understand, and then, an actual material. Once that started to happen about in the last decade, once these three things came together, this field has just taken off, and who knows where it’s going to go.";25;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How have you been able to keep your enthusiasm up within this field during your career?;"Duncan Haldane: I think we’ve just kept on, things just got cooler. I think in this whole field, I mean, it’s been so fruitful. It’s been actually great for young people at every stage in their career in this field. Other fields, like high-temperature superconductivity has really been the graveyard of many people, because it has been unclear, it’s complicated, and there’s lots of rival theories which fights this and that, and there’s people knifing each other… But in this field, every time a problem came up it got solved and something very interesting and new came up, and people said “fine”. But it’s renewed, it has kept on; new things have kept coming on, and in fact, it’s just been a sequence of progressively more and more cool things coming out. So definitely it keeps one’s interest up. And of course, you try and understand the big picture; the big picture is kind of gradually being assembled. So, it is still an exciting field and it is still going to continue to be an exciting field.";25;Creativity
And you brought some artefacts for the museum, what did you bring?;Michael Kosterlitz: I brought some things representing my two passions in life, or my two passions in life at the time. Which are one rock-climbing guide to big cliff in North Wales, and some old calculations on something, that unfortunately is not what I got the prize for, but one of the few hand read notes that we could find, after I had done a major clear-out. That was, what, 40 years ago or something, so of course, it’s had a few clean-outs since. And old scribbled notes which may be of some value, should I become famous. But at the time, the idea of becoming famous was just ridiculous, so it all went.;26;Donation
And the rock-climbing guide, you used to be a very avid rock climber?;"Michael Kosterlitz: Yes, I have two greater passions in life; well, probably in order my passions in life were first rock climbing, second physics and third family.";26;Creativity
You are awarded the prize this year for absolute first research that you did, coming into the field that you now work in. Can you tell me a bit about how that came about?;Michael Kosterlitz: I was doing high-energy physics and doing lots of elaborate calculations for no return. Then, I was a post-doc in Italy, and of course I needed another job, so the plan was to go to CERN in Geneva, but I failed to get the paperwork in on time, as is my standard procedure, and ended up at Birmingham university, because that was one of the few places from which I got an offer at the very late stage in the game. Birmingham was actually the last place I wanted to go, but it turned out to be the best move I ever made. Because it was there that I met David Thouless and we started working on this problem. Mind you at the time, as far as I was concerned, it was just an entertaining theoretical problem, no more. I had no conception that this could turn in to something big, no idea at all. I doubt that either of us had. It wasn’t until, probably about the 80ies at the earliest, that I realised that we had done something good.;26;Impact of the Nobel on you
So, in this time after you had done your research, until the time that you really realised what it had led to, did you think about changing fields again, or moving to other parts within physics?;"Michael Kosterlitz: Well, I did change fields; I started working on what is called non-equilibrium problems, in other words, on systems which aren’t in thermal equilibrium. And I was hoping to do something as good, when I realised that the work I had done, David and I had done, was actually good work. And I was trying to do something as good in another field but, never managed.";26;Motivation
Have you moved back to this field again, is this what you are working on right now?;Michael Kosterlitz: I haven’t moved back, because I haven’t really thought about the field for a long time. And there’s lots of other people work in the field, and are way ahead, you know, have developed it much further. And so, I am, I guess you could call it, one of the ‘grand old men’ of the field, who has trotted out from time to time to say some deep words about it. But beyond that I don’t really do much in the way of research in that field.;26;Research
You work with topological changes and phase transitions. When the prize was presented, the Royal Academy brought out some different type of baked goods. Can you try to give us a bit of overview why this would be a useful image?;Michael Kosterlitz: Ok, I’ll try. Let me start by saying that topology is a mathematical subject, which is concerned with the shapes of materials. Not the detailed shapes, because after all, as far as topology is concerned, a plane, you know, a flat surface, is equivalent to a sphere, which is equivalent to any shape you like. All that topology is interested in is the number of holes in the system. It’s a classification of shapes which can be continuously deformed into each other.;26;Creativity
You can’t have a half of a hole?;"Michael Kosterlitz: Right. I mean, the rules are, you can’t get rid of a hole. Once a hole is there, you can’t get rid of it. Or you can’t make a new hole. Now the connection to what we did is a bit of a stretch, but the idea is that if you take your film of superfluid helium on a nice, flat surface – of course there are no holes in this surface. You say to yourself, what on earth has topology got to do with this? Well, in this context it doesn’t, but there are excitations in films of helium, where the fluid circles round and round a point. These are called vortices. And these excitations do exist, and it turns out they are quite important.
This is where topology comes in; because the surface of the manifold of which the topology is defined, is this layer of superfluid, not the actual thing that it is supported on. And so, if you got a vortex, where the fluid is spinning round and round, near the centre of the vortex, the velocity of the fluid has to divert; go to infinity. Which means that the material can’t be superfluid there, so that is going to hole. So, in other words, if you have a vortex produced, for whatever reason, the topology of the system changes.";26;Research
Was that an intuitive leap, I mean, when you first thought of this idea? Because coming from the outside, it seems as two quite disparate things. Was it intuitive to you that this was a mathematical model that could be used?;"Michael Kosterlitz: Not directly. Because to me the physics was all in the various excitations that can occur. So, it is obvious that if you like, well we didn’t know it before we worked on this, that a vortex in superfluid helium, the centre of the vortex, was either empty, nothing there, or it was a normal fluid, not superfluid. So that part of it is simple. And so, I myself came from this point of view; I was only interested in the excitations, topology I didn’t know a thing about. Of course, I had the advantage of working with David Thouless, who seemed to know everything about everything. So, he realised that this was, you know, he used the word topology. And once he explained what topology meant, to me it suddenly became obvious. Call it topology or not, it didn’t really matter, but it sounded like a nice way to talk about it, so we called it ‘topological excitation’.";26;Creativity
Are you surprised of how much this field has grown since you’ve worked in it?;"Michael Kosterlitz: I am amazed. Because there are so many …  The original papers are referred to so often it’s almost embarrassing. I knew that we both knew very well, that the same ideas could be applied to talking about two-dimensional crystals, at least the melting of two-dimensional crystals. Because the essential excitations that melted the crystal, you can call them dislocations if you wish, which are analogous to vortices in superfluid helium. That is as far as we went with the two-dimensional melting. You can work anything out, at least I did a calculation which didn’t go anywhere, because we made the assumption that the lattice structure didn’t matter. Then we also knew that in principle it could be applied to a superconducting film. So, given an estimate of what the critical temperature should be and so on.
But we never really took it seriously, because our argument was that you couldn’t have true superconductivity in thin films. Which is a correct argument, but we never thought about the question of how, what length scales superconductivity could exist. In turns out that experimentally, if you have a system of, let’s say, a centimetre, you know linear size a centimetre or so, which is big by experimental standards, then, as far as, this system should obey the standard vortex theory, and the cut off that is inherent in superconductivity is irrelevant, because it’s of the order of a centimetre as well.";26;Research
So, are there any of these, I mean, there a number of proposed practical applications for this work. And sort of, moving on looking into the future, are there any applications that you are especially looking forward to seeing?;Michael Kosterlitz: Oh yes! Oh yes yes yes. Because the hope is that the applications in quantum mechanical systems will eventually lead to this magic quantum computer. And I’ll be waiting for my desktop quantum computer. I hope to get one before I die, but I think that perhaps I shouldn’t hold my breath and wait and expect to get one. But anyway, with the developments in quantum mechanics, related to our ideas, it’s starting to look like a quantum computer may not be such a pie dream as I originally thought.;26;Meaning of Work
Looking at your career as a scientist, is there any person that really has inspired you, in your work or in your life?;"Michael Kosterlitz: Lots of people. My co-worker David Thouless. I first met him as a London graduate in Cambridge and Oxford around 1961, something like that. And he was teaching us, and it was ‘mathematics for scientists’ or something like that. And as soon as he started lecturing, I realised I am in presence of a mind that operates in a different level to mine, and probably most other people. So, of course, I was incredibly happy to collaborate with David, because collaborating with somebody with a mind like that, is just an amazing experience.
Then there are other people who have certainly influenced me greatly. There is Michael Fischer at Cornell, who taught me, I was a post-doc there, back in, when was it 1973-74, who taught me about phase transitions and critical phenomena and the importance of experimental work and how theories and experiments should collaborate and criticise each other. Then there was John Reppy, also Cornell, also a superb experimentalist, and who is responsible for the experimental verification of our theory. So, I guess there are all sorts of people who influenced my thinking and my career. But the most important ones happened early in my life. And the most important one is of course David Thouless.";26;Mentor(Role Models)
I know you have been diagnosed with MS some time ago. How did you, what did you do? And how did you sort of overcome, and handle something like that?;Michael Kosterlitz: I didn’t really manage to handle it very well at all, because at the time, as I said earlier, my major obsession, and a big part of my life, was mountain climbing. And that I had to quit because I couldn’t do it anymore. It is not easy to continue when half your life is just cut, you know you have no choice but to cut it out. I had a great deal of difficulty in coming to terms with my disability. However, fortunately, as my neurologist likes to say, I’m his star patient, so I did… My version of MS is at least one of these, going to the big remission where I come back almost to the level that I was before the attack. So eventually I managed to replace my passion for mountaineering with other things, and now I do work a lot and I travel a lot. And fortunately, I’ve got a very valuable wife who supports me whatever I feel like doing. And keeps on insisting ‘Look Michael, you can do it – its not as bad as you think, you can do it’. That is very important to me.;26;Creativity
you’ve said earlier that coming into the field that you were awarded the prize for, one of the crucial things was your total ignorance of the details of that field. What do you mean by that, what do you mean when you say that?;Michael Kosterlitz: Exactly what I said. Because, I was a high-energy physicist. And so, my graduate work at Oxford was all in high-energy physics, and I simply went to the required lectures and so on, and something called statistical mechanics, which I sort of ‘mm’ it was one of these model, rather difficult subjects, where it wasn’t part of my chosen research. I didn’t pay much attention to it. But statistical mechanics is the central tool of condensed-matter physics, so when I went to this problem with David Thouless, changed from high-energy to condensed-matter, then statistical mechanics became very important.;26;Impact of the Nobel on you
And was it important for you to sort of look at the problem with sort of unconventional eyes, or…?;Michael Kosterlitz: Well sure, oh yes! Because, if you knew too much about it, if you were a normal person like me, you wouldn’t even go into the field because there are plenty of rigorous theorems, which were interpreted, is meaning that in that in systems like thin films of helium, two-dimensional crystals couldn’t exist. And there’s nothing wrong with the theorem, it’s just the interpretation of the theorem that was wrong. So David, who knew about these things, realised that it was just the interpretation that was wrong. Me, I was so stupid and ignorant that I said, I had no idea that this lack of long-range order was a serious problem. And so, I went ahead and basically looked at the problem in a different way, and it worked out.;26;Mentors (Role models)
What’s your story? What brought you to science?;Takaaki Kajita: When I was a high school student, I learnt basic physics and I started to get interested in physics. Then I decided to learn physics in undergraduate and I learned that the physics was really interesting and I decided to learn more and therefore I joined Professor Koshiba’s group in the graduate course and I started the Kamiokande experiment. Actually, that was really the motivation for become a scientist.;27;Motivation
Who was your most inspiring teacher?;Takaaki Kajita: The most inspiring teacher to me was Professor Koshiba. He essentially told me that we always have to have a new idea about the new researches and also we always think about the really important researches.;27;Mentors (Role models)
Describe your Nobel Prize-awarded work in one minute.;Takaaki Kajita: The work I was awarded to this Nobel Prize is based on studies of neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere.  We observed that neutrinos passing through the earth are disappearing, well, half of them are disappearing, and this was concluded as the evidence for neutrino oscillations and therefore the evidence for the neutrino mass.;27;Research
What motivated you to pursue your research?;Takaaki Kajita: In 1986 I was analyzing the Kamiokande data, almost accidently I found that there is a significant deficiency in the newer neutron events observed in Kamiokande. That was really surprising, and this was the motivation for me to continue studies of atmospheric neutrinos in the later 20 years.;27;Motivation
Have you had a eureka moment?;Takaaki Kajita: Yes, again I think that eureka moment to me is the moment that we discovered the deficit of neutrino events in Kamiokande.;27;Creativity
What’s the toughest challenge you’ve faced? How did you overcome it?;Takaaki Kajita: The hardest time in my research work was when the Super-Kamiokande was badly broken in 2001. In the end we were able to recover from this accident, but the most important ingredient to get the Super-Kamiokande back was the good leadership and also the good teamwork. The photomultiplier tubes used in Super-Kamiokande was broken, more than half of them were broken in about ten seconds. Why these photomultiplier tubes were broken? Well, we think that one of the photomultiplier tubes in Super-Kamiokande was broken spontaneously, then it generated a shockwave and this shockwave broke the adjacent photomultiplier tubes and then these photomultiplier tubes generated another shockwave breaking the other photomultiplier tubes and this was what happened in 2001. After that accident Super-Kamiokande collaboration decided to rebuild the detector and we worked together to recover the original configuration. It took several years to recover to the full configuration.;27;Creativity
What’s your story? What brought you to science?;Arthur B. McDonald: What brought me to science started back in high school when I had an interest in science, but really a more substantial interest in mathematics which was generated by a really excellent teacher who went out of his way to deal with us outside class and really get us fascinated by the whole subject of mathematics. When I went to university I was inspired by another physics teacher and I went to university thinking I wanted to do science and, with physics, the whole idea that you really could use mathematics to calculate how things work in detail intrigued me. I found out I was good at it, so what brought me to it was a combination of the fact that it was fascinating and that I seemed to be able to do it so I continued with physics through a masters degree and then a PhD and then my career. I have continued to feel exactly the same way, I am fascinated by it, I am still fascinated by the fact that you can do calculations that actually show how the universe works in great detail from the most microscopic to the largest scales. It is just great fun to have the opportunity to work in that sort of area.;28;Motivation
Describe your Nobel Prize-awarded work in 1 minute.;Arthur B. McDonald: What we received the prize for was determining brand new properties of neutrinos, fundamental particles that along with electrons and quarks we can’t subdivide any further and in the standard model of physics were thought to have zero mass and not change from one of the three types into another. We use neutrinos from the sun with a measurement using a material called heavy water that enabled us not only to measure the number of neutrinos of the type produced in the sun, the electron neutrinos, but also the sum of all neutrino types. If you compare those two you can tell whether or not there has been a change. We saw only one third surviving of the electron neutrino types showing that they change and that they therefore have a finite mass.;28;Research
What’s the toughest challenge you’ve faced? How did you overcome it?;"Arthur B. McDonald: In 1989 I was presented with the challenge of being the director of an experiment to measure neutrinos from the sun using an enormous detector, the size of a 10 story building, two kilometers underground in an active nickel mine where they were simultaneously taking about five thousand tons of ore out of the other side of the same shaft. A very small shaft, about three meters by three meters by four meters into which we had to parcel all of the roughly one million parts of our detector. We had to do it in an ultra-clean environment because we were seeking to observe one neutrino an hour and we had to restrict all of the remaining parts to have radioactivity levels that did not interfere with this. We had created an ultra-clean environment, that environment was equivalent of what is created for producing semiconductor chips in a factory, in this enormously dusty environment. We also were able to borrow three hundred million dollars’ worth of a material called heavy water, which is about one in seven thousand water molecules have an extra neutron in the hydrogen nucleus, it was that neutron that made our experiment possible.
It was an enormous engineering task, you had to combine science and engineering to get the best of both in the overall process. You had hundreds of people working together in order for this to happen. I guess the biggest challenge was to try to get the tremendous creativity that each individual had working in a co-operative manner so that you were able to accomplish something that was truly unique and had not been done before in many of its different elements. So it was really a combination of making sure you didn’t compromise your scientific principles at any point, but practicing the art of the possible and dealing with the human element of such a large group of varied individuals and make sure that you get the best of all those talents applied to a successful project. So that was a challenge, and how did I accomplish it? I just had to deal with one day at a time and the questions that you came up with. But the biggest thing was having a tremendous group of very accomplished collaborators.";28;Creativity
What motivated you to pursue your research?;"Arthur B. McDonald: I was a member of the original sixteen people who came together to start this project. We were inspired by a wonderful scientist named Herb Chen from the University of California at Irvine and a scientist from Canada named George Ewan. Herb Chen said You know if we had enough heavy water we could potentially solve a real problem for neutrinos from the sun in which it was observed that too few were being measured compared to what was calculated. One of the possible explanations of that was that neutrinos were changing from one type to the other and escaping previous experiments and that could be rectified by the use of heavy water. So it was a tremendous scientific concept that you could really answer once and for all a basic question in which if it were true you would be dealing with physics that goes beyond the very basic standard model and brings in new properties of neutrinos requiring a change to the most fundamental laws of physics.
We were all inspired by that idea that we could really go beyond the known because neutrinos have a very big influence in our universe. They affect how the universe evolves, the mass of neutrinos affects how stars and galaxies are formed. Neutrinos form a big part of supernova explosions where all of the elements greater than iron in mass are formed. We also knew that we could answer very fundamental questions about the sun if we were able to make these measurements. So the physics was very compelling, we as a group went on to add a number of other institutions, we ended up altogether with about 270 physics authors on our papers and that really indicates the number of people we were able to educate in the process and that was the other thing we thought was great. This a wonderful educational opportunity if we could possibly carry it off and so that is what motivated us. So, it was a very fundamental question to be answered.";28;Motivation
What questions remain to be answered in your research?;"Arthur B. McDonald: There are number of very interesting questions remaining to be answered. We know now that neutrinos do change from one type to another and that means that they have a finite mass. We don’t know how large that mass is although we have some limits. Fortunately, we have an opportunity right next door in our laboratory in the same underground location with ultra clean environment, two kilometers underground to be able to address a number of these questions and we are doing so. One of the questions is this question of neutrino mass and also symmetries of the neutrino relating to the relationship between antimatter and matter, between neutrinos and antineutrinos. That may be an explanation for why it is in the early universe all of the antimatter decayed away leaving us with a matter dominated universe. Both of those questions, that and the absolute mass of neutrinos, can be answered by studying particular elements, in our case tellurium, that can undergo a process in which two neutrinos potentially could be emitted, it’s called double beta decay. By studying that very rare radioactivity in a reconstituted Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, with a so-called liquid scintillator in the middle with tellurium in, it we can address this question.
In other areas of our laboratory we are addressing another very big question which is what are the dark matter particles that in many ways behave similarly to neutrinos. They are weakly interacting, they pass through material very easily, but we know they have to be much more massive than the neutrinos that we measured from the sun or the atmosphere and those particles we think go well beyond our current knowledge of particles, they are a realm that we’d like to explore by observing the ones that are left over from the original Big Bang, because we feel that perhaps there was enough energy then to produce them and there is good evidence for them in our galaxy. People at CERN are attempting to produce them for the first time since the Big Bang so there is a lot of co-operative effort there. But we feel with about four or five different approaches to dark matter detection in our laboratory we have an excellent chance to perhaps observe them for the first time.";28;Future research
Where do you do your best thinking?;Arthur B. McDonald: These days if I have a question that I really need to address in detail what I do is to sit with my computer which through google gives me access basically to the information that currently exists in the world. I used to do this in a library. In other words, I need to know what is already known on a topic that I am attempting to consider. I then write what I’m attempting to figure out in a very organised way. When I come to a given point in the problem I then look at what is already known about it and learn as much I can, attempt to work my way through the physics of it using my own knowledge of physics and my hands-on background in terms of how one does experiments. And in that way I simply organise myself over a period of hours, typically sitting by myself in a room in front of my computer attempting to come to an answer for the particular thing that I’m attempting to address. On the other hand, there are instances in which I wake up at three o’clock in the morning and all of a sudden I have the answer to something that I have been trying to figure out. That’s happened to me a number of times and I try to write it down and then get back to sleep. Sometimes I can’t get back to sleep and I end up sitting up and writing what has suddenly occurred to me. But I do find that every now and again there is an inspiration that comes in the middle of the night.;28;Environment
Have you had a eureka moment?;"Arthur B. McDonald: We are very fortunate in our experiment to have a very specific eureka moment because, and we have had several of them actually in our experiment, because we had several phases in which we approached the measurements that we were doing with different techniques. But in each case we worked out a way such that we were blinding, as we say, the people that are analysing the data. In other words, we didn’t want people to start with a preconceived notion of what the answer is for neutrinos where you are trying to make sure that you are seeing neutrinos in this very complex detector and not something else that is similar to them, but really is a radioactive background or something like that. So we introduced, we did several things, we only analysed part of the data in order to define all the parameters in which we were going to approach our final analysis. Or in some cases we actually added in extra data that looked like what we were looking for, but only one person in the collaboration knew how much of that had been added in. So that nobody really knew what the answer was until on one day all of a sudden, we removed the blindness.
Then everyone in the collaboration all at once knew and this happened particularly in 2002 for our major paper. Everyone all at once knew that we had an answer and not only was that an answer that said that neutrinos had changed from one type to another, but it had what we referred to as a five standard deviation uncertainty in it, meaning that there is less than a chance in ten million that this is not what you see as the result that neutrinos do change from one type to another and so yes, there was a collaboration-wide eureka moment. At any given point, I think on that particular paper there were 176 authors and so the majority of them had the opportunity to say eureka all at the same time. In some cases, students who had signed up for their PhD thesis on this and when you get a eureka moment like that as a part of your graduate education, it can be great fun.";28;Creativity
What advice would you give yourself at 20 years old?;"Arthur B. McDonald: I guess there is partly a question whether I am meeting myself as a twenty-year-old student when I was actually twenty years old or whether I was presuming that today I am twenty years old and in the present circumstances I will give some advice. I will take the second of them and the advice I would give to that person is both general and it is specific. The specific will be to pursue the field in which I have worked because there’s still many things still to be learned. I will speak about that in a moment. The general would be train yourself at age twenty as broadly as you can, train yourself in the basic science that you are attempting to pursue. Read all those books, understand all those equations, work out all those examples and the problems that your professor gives you. That basic information is going to be essential for you to have overall the ability to be an accomplished researcher in this field. But in my case for experimental physics, learn how to be hands-on, learn how to work a lathe to build a piece of equipment, get into the machine shop and actually physically construct things, because then you will learn what is possible and what is not possible, everything from the most microscopic to the largest piece of equipment and this goes in to computers and electronics and so on.
Train yourself technically in order that you can be confident in all of these things. Don’t neglect the interpersonal elements of collaboration in science. Both in terms of the person next door and in terms of international collaborators. You have to develop a certain amount of what these days has come to be known as emotional intelligence as well as analytic intelligence in order for you to be able to gain the most benefit from an extremely skilled set of people out there in the world. If you can choose very good collaborators in your work, you are going to end up, all of you, in the collaboration able to accomplish very substantial things and so make sure you pay attention to how to get along with other people, how to understand what their motivation is for what they are doing and how to assess their skills such that you can have a complementary group of people accomplishing what you are trying to accomplish.
And I would say to you to consider the field in which I have been working, it is called particle astrophysics. It is a way of understanding particles that in many cases come from astronomical sources. It is a way in which we attempt to understand the most basic laws of physics. The ones that were defining things back in the very beginnings of the universe when the environment was very different than it is today. There are many very important questions still to be answered, we don’t know what dark matter is, we don’t know what dark energy is. We know it is there, it influences how our universe has evolved. Dark matter is accessible in a number of different ways, very important experiments going on to address it either by observing it directly or inferring its presence in both accelerator experiments and also astronomical measurements. It is a very big question because there’s five times as many dark matter particles as there are the particles that make us up in ordinary matter. And so a very fundamental question that’s I think addressable in a not too distant future so I would certainly recommend that type of study to people today. We have a universe that is becoming understood much more in the last twenty years or so than it ever has before. I would recommend that they become a part of that exercise.
Would I like to have obtained the advice I just stated when I was twenty years old? I think actually I did get that advice. I had the benefit of excellent teachers who approached things in just the way that I described. When I talk about learning how a machine works in the machine shop, actually all of us as graduate students at Caltech had to take a course in the machine shop from a truly excellent machinist. With respect to getting along with other people, I learned that from my parents when I was very young and also from my professors. In terms of studying hard and trying to understand things broadly that’s certainly also advice that I got at that time. So yes, I accepted all of that and I think I would accept it again";28;Advice for young scientists
What does intelligence mean to you?;"Arthur B. McDonald: Intelligence, I think is the ability to size up a situation and attempt to understand what the essence of the thing you are dealing with is. Which in some instance requires you to be very analytical, requires you to go in to the scientific background that has been developed and in some cases be very creative in order to make that jump to the next level of synthesising all of the information that you have obtained both from past experience of yourself and others and also the information that you see in front of you. That analytic intelligence is something that the scientist can benefit from greatly.
I think there is another kind of intelligence as well which is tended to be called emotional intelligence these days, which is a way of assessing a situation that involves interpersonal relationships as well. And that is something if you are able to understand what’s happening in terms of other people’s approach to a topic, if you understand other people’s motivation, understand where they are coming from on a given situation and able to understand therefore how you and they can work together to obtain a solution to this particular problem that you are confronting or even simply to end up becoming friends and proceeding. That’s something I think is type of intelligence that the people who mastered well have quite a happy life, so I think there is a lot of different kinds of intelligence.";28;Competencies
What were you doing when you heard you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;When there were the announcements, I was on a plane from Japan to Frankfurt, that transit. When I took out from the plane, I saw many e-mails entitled “Congratulations, congratulations”, but I did not understand the reasons of all congratulations because I didn’t have time to open up the e-mails. So, I closed the PC and went to the final destination from Frankfurt to Rio. At the exit of the arrival gate, many Japanese journalists were there. They said: “Congratulations Amano-san, you have got the Nobel Prize.” That is the time when I knew I have received the Nobel Prize.;30;Impact of Nobel on you
Could you please explain your Nobel Prize awarded work in simple terms?;Maybe you know this place of portable games and there are also cellular phones or smartphones? In 1980s it was monochrome but now all the games and the smartphones are full colors. So in order to realise the full colors, blue light-emitting diodes it is necessary so we are achieving the blue light-emitting diodes. That is what we have done.;30;Research
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;One point is to realise bright blue LEDs, we need very high-quality crystals, that is gallium nitride. One thing is to realise very high-quality gallium nitride and the other one is to publicate LEDs, we need both N-type and B-type conductivity and for the N-type it is not so difficult, but B-type it was very, very difficult. So, we achieved the B-type conduction. Back in 1985, when I saw the samples, I thought that I forgot or missed something because the crystals were too perfect or too good, but when I checked by the microscope, I found that we have done it. That was a very amazing moment for me.;30;Creativity
What brought you to science?;The thing that brought me to the science it is, when I was a child I couldn’t understand why I should study, but when I entered the university some professor told us that the reason why we study is to contribute to the mankind or contribute to the human society or human life. So, I understood the reason why we should study and for me the science is the most nearest field which I can contribute to the people. That is why I was interested in the science.;30;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;"Role model is of course professor Isamu Akasaki, he was my excellent supervisor. He was very much interested in the crystals and he have studied the semiconductor crystals for a long, long time; germanium, gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide and also the gallium nitride and he insisted in growing the high-quality crystals. So, he is my role model.";30;Mentors (Role models)
What has been the most significant breakthrough in your career?;Shuji Nakamura: I think, because in 1993 I could develop the very high efficient blue LEDs that is almost 100 times brighter than all the blue LED. All the blue LEDs in long time ago, already in 1970’s already, some people already developed blue LEDs, but that is not the p-n junction blue LED but that is very dim. My invention is 100 times brighter so this blue LEDs can be used in all kinds of applications – it is bright enough for all kinds of applications. So that is when I realised that my invention is great, that is in 1993. Of course, I achieved this big breaks in 1993 I had already achieved several breakthrough like p-type gallium nitride, indium gallium nitride and all they all maybe were similar breakthroughs but this in 1993 the final was a breakthrough for the high efficient blue LED as a product.;31;Creativity
What brought you to science?;Shuji Nakamura: Math is the most important because during my childhood using math, I expect the using you know, I could understand what was happening in the nature because using the equations I tried to explain what was happening in the nature using one equation. So that is my feeling of the maths. Also, in the same time math is used to explain the nature, all kind of things happening. Most important math plus also people has to show the interest of the nature. To understand the nature, we need maths and also physics – maths and physics. The most important, children have to play outside to understand what is happening in nature and also to sort of understand nature we need some tool like maths – the tool is maths. And also gradually maths become physics and physics also become the tool to explain the nature, so that combination is very important for childhood. Play outside to understand nature, study math and physics.;31;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;Shuji Nakamura: Sorry, I don’t have, because I have no role model at all because I was born in a very remote city where I worked at study in the city and my university also located in a very remote city in Japan and no famous professors were there. I joined a small company and no famous people worked there. In my years I had to do everything myself from scratch – everything, so no role model in my case. Many people are asking about my role model, and I say no, nobody. I just had to do everything myself. Most important is that people have to believe in themselves because people have to try new things and greater expectations and greater confidence – that is the most important. Just be yourself.;31;Mentors (Role models)
What were you doing when you heard you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Shuji Nakamura: I was sleeping because I live in California, Santa Barbara. The Nobel Foundation called me just around midnight, or almost 2 a.m. California time so I was sleeping and then suddenly I got the phone call and they said “Congratulations, you have got the Nobel Prize” and I was surprised. So I was sleeping, yeah.;31;Impact of Nobel on you
Did your life change after the award?;Basically no change. Lot of mass media came to me for interviews but a lot of noise happening caused by mass media, but my studies and research work is no change. Already thinking my ideas and studies – so basically no change but a lot of noise and mass media is contacting me. But basically no change. The final reward is I don’t know, we changed it so the overall /spread/ is around 50 percent and our goal is to cross 100 percent, so we have to work very hard to increase and change our third /- – -/.;31;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Could you describe your Nobel Prize awarded work for young students?;"François Englert: First I will tell them or remind them if they know a little bit that all the matter that we have around us is composed of atoms. The atoms are kind of mini solar system, not quite, but nevertheless it’s an image, and in the middle there is an nucleus which is round. And for a long time this was supposed, the whole the atom, to be not … that it was not possible to cut it and to separate it, but now we know that it is. Inside the atom there are particles which are called quarks and other particles of all kind which of the constituent fundamental of matter which are what called elementary particles and there are also other elementary particles which are constituent of things which are transmitted from one object to another like photons which are constituents of light and there are other ones. Some of these particles have no mass and some have mass. Photons have no mass and the characteristic of mass is normally when you push it, it’s very difficult, if it’s a high mass it’s very difficult to push it.
But the more detailed meaning of what it means is that those particles which have no mass travel, whatever you do, with the same velocity which is the velocity of light. Particles which have mass never reach the velocity of light, so that’s the big distinction between the two. The problem was that one did not succeed to make a theory which could predict what one could do with this elementary particle. In particular we know what we can do of them, everything that is around us, whether it’s that glass, whether it’s the door, whether it’s this television apparatus whatever. We can do all of that, but the recipe for doing that was not really well known and one particular difficulty is that one could imagine constructing a recipe which would work if all particles which have no mass. If all particles which have no mass, then one could indeed form a formula which would predict everything but that would result in predicting nothing because after all that is not the world that we live in.
So we were obliged to invent how particles which have no mass can acquire mass, some of them at least, and some not. For this we imagined at that moment some particles, bosons, scale bosons, whatever the name is on it and that condense to give kind of a sea, but a sea that exists all over the universe so that every particle has to go through it, including ourselves. So the elementary particle that goes through them can acquire a mass if they are sensitive to this, that is more complicated to understand, but the theory predicts which are the particle which will get a mass and those which will not get a mass. That essentially permitted to construct the recipe for doing the thing and the important thing of course is that from this condensation it is possible to extract one particle and test if the theory is correct and that is what has been done at CERN. I don’t know if a 13-14 years old will get something, but I hope they will at least get a little bit interested.";32;Research
Why did you go into science?;François Englert: When I was in secondary school I was actually interested very much in literature but I was also very much interested in mathematics. My teacher in mathematics, I liked him very much, I think it’s about the only one I liked when I was in the secondary school. I had a very good relation with him. I was not a bad student, so he pushed me to enter the polytechnic school for engineering. This was also partly because engineering in Belgium requires an entrance examination which is very hard, actually in three places if you wish the diploma of secondary school. You don’t have to do secondary school if you succeed that exam. He prepared me for that exam, so I was an engineer. Being an engineer, I realized that I don’t want to be an engineer, but I was an engineer so that gave me … I realized by being an engineer that what interested me is not so much the application of things but the way they really function. That is why I got interested in physics and research and fundamental physics. After having been engineer I got sufficient money because I had a job at the university, and I studied physics afterwards. Then I had my PhD and then I went to the United States and met Robert Brout with whom I collaborated a lot and that’s in a short hand the story.;32;Motivation
Who is your role model, and why?;François Englert: There is one person which I consider as an extraordinary physicist at that time I knew him. He is a man of extraordinary humanity, that is Nambu, in fact who got the Nobel Prize by the way. And he was the one who introduced the essential notion which was essential for doing the model which was taken from the theory of phase transition in solid … statistical theory of solid objects and to field theory, which I liked. I was interested by many people who did it, but I think I generally wanted … and Robert Brout was famous like me, we wanted to work things by ourselves. But Nambu played an important role, that is for sure.;32;Mentors (Role models)
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;"François Englert: I think we realized it nearly immediately, I can tell you something about that. To be clear our work was kind of a general theory, we were not sure to what it would apply. Actually, we thought first it would apply to the strong forces which was a mistake, but we then realized it applied to electroweak forces. But we didn’t make the theory, that was won by Weinberg, Salam and Glashow who had the Nobel Prize for that and there have been a lot of Nobel Prize connected to this theory. First the Nobel Prize for the electroweak theory, the Nobel Prize for the fact – which was very important and which we were completely aware of from the beginning – which is the fact that it’s valid quantum mechanically which was proven in a beautiful way by Dr. Veltman, they got the Nobel Prize. There was a discovery by particles at CERN the W and the Z boson which transmute … which have mass and transmit the weak interaction and that was also a Nobel Prize.
All of these were essentially the base to particles to what we have constructed as a theory but of course there is a lot of things to be added to get all of that and it took time. The point is that after let’s say -83, 1983 when world discovered the W and the Z we were totally convinced that the theory was two, but there was still an alternative. Either it was mediated by a condensate of objects, the sea, which was not the boson, or it was the bosons, which were condensate. We in our original paper put both hypotheses and didn’t know which was the right one and at that moment in- 83 it was still untrue, which was the right one and it is the discovery at CERN that would select the right one which is one of the two hypotheses we put in -64.
So I have a bit deviated from your question which is when did we realize, of course we didn’t realize all of that, that’s obvious, but we realized that I think it was a break-through, because we saw that it was the first time there is a way to understand how interaction, fundamental interaction which acts between objects which are very close to them and are not felt at large distances – that is called short-range interaction – that that could work, and so I remember with Robert Brout, who was my friend, and we worked together after that also for years, that we went to a café that I still see very well and we ordered a bottle of champagne and we said … and that was I think a few months after having had the article, so that we had the impression. We were a little bit sad that people didn’t seem to realize that or to pay attention, let’s say. There were good reason not to pay attention at that time, because there were lots of things. But I think we had the right. We were convinced by the way we did it, we didn’t have a proof at that time that it was consistent quantum mechanically, but the way we constructed it – which is very peculiar at that time – it’s based on what’s called field theory and we had the impression that that at the end would work and so we celebrated, we might have celebrated wrongly, but at least we got the champagne and that was fine.";32;Creativity
Could you explain the standard model?;"François Englert: The standard model is precisely what classifies all these particles from which we can construct the whole world. Actually, the standard model contains essentially all these quarks, these electrons that constitute the atoms, all the other elementary particles that one can construct out of them, or then out of collisions, and it contains … describes the force which are /---/ them and that is essentially the recipe because the forces are also transmitted by some elementary particles some which have mass, some which don’t have mass, photons have no mass, those which give the so-called weak interaction give mass. Essentially there are three kinds of interaction which are included in the standard model: the electromagnetic interaction, the weak interaction, which are responsible in particular for the disintegration, radioactive decay, and these two were united in a theory that make a very deep use of our theory which was then in a quite general frame. And the standard model contains in addition strong interaction which also are interaction between objects which are inside the nucleus, but which are responsible for essentially the cohesion of these nuclei. These are the strong interactions which are not explained by our theory but by something different, which actually is essentially related to our theory by something which is called, let’s say it’s the opposite. The opposite of something is not necessarily very distinct, that it is.
These are the three types of interaction which form these particles that we know today that are hold together and getting a mass with this boson that was discovered or rather by the sea of them which gives this sea which permeates the universe and there is another interaction which we feel every day, which is gravitation  which is what … we let an object fall and it falls and why the planets turn around the earth,and why everything like that works and that is also a theory, but for the moment it is not included in the standard model. It is something apart, we know it very well, it is the first thing that was known, it was redeveloped by Einstein and generalized by Einstein, it’s called – a bad name, but it is called general relativity. That was in the beginning of the 20th century and, so, that is very well known, but it has its difficulties and not, I don’t know if you want to enter into that, that’s more complicated.";32;Research
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Nobel Prize?;François Englert: First it took some time to hear it because there was some delay. When I was there, three of my daughters were with me and my wife, because after all it was quite possible, it was not totally unexpected that I would get it, let’s say, the Nobel Prize. So we were waiting and then we had decided that for some reason either they did not give it for the theory this year or whatever, my daughter were not quite nice with what they said about the Nobel Committee at that time because they thought that we don’t get it, but then the call came and so I was of course extremely happy and so were my daughters and my wife.;32;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Could you describe your Nobel Prize awarded work for young students?;Peter Higgs: Imagine a snowfield, and that is an analogous to this background field throughout all the universe, this affects the way that people crossing it in different ways depending on whether they wear skis or snowshoes or just boots. The analogy is then that the people with skis relatively unaffected and untroubled with high high speed, people with snowshoes do not quite so well and the people who just wear boots go very slowly and that analogy is with the effect on some kind of particles which continue to travel this speed of light and the massless and what happens to particles which are heavier, but to me that contains less of the physics than my more roundabout explanation.;33;Research
Can you explain the standard model?;Peter Higgs: The work which was done in 1964 led to the so called electroweak theory, the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions in elementary particles which was done in 1967 by Weinberg and Salam by taking a theory, which had the right kind of unification but couldn’t produce good calculations due to Glashow, and combining it with the kind of models of symmetry breaking which we had discussed in -64. That was the beginning of the standard model, because once that theory was shown to be mathematically sound, that you could really calculate with it, people started to study other kinds of so-called gauge theory in relation to the other forces in particle physics and those investigations led on to a theory of the strong forces, called quantum chromodynamics. So the work in -64 was the beginning of the return of this kind of so-called quantum field theory in particle physics. It had previously been successful in the 50s, quantum electrodynamics, and then became neglected in particles that didn’t seem to work and what we did was a step on the way to making it work.;33;Research
At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?;"Peter Higgs: It wasn’t a precise moment. The way in which I came to this realisation was that I was trying to evade a theorem which had been proved about this way of breaking symmetries in particle physics which implied that there would exist massless particles without spin. This theorem made this kind of theory unacceptable because such particles were not known. The theory in which these occurred had been formulated four years earlier by Yoichiro Nambu who got a share of the 2008 prize and Jeffrey Goldstone and it was really for me a matter of realizing that the theorem as proved had a flaw in it, there were certain mathematical axioms which you need to prove any kind of theorem which certain kinds of theory of fields didn’t obey. And the prime example of the kind of field which didn’t obey these axioms was Maxwell’s electromagnetic field as it occurs in quantum electrodynamics.
Quantum electrodynamics is a theory which doesn’t involve this phenomenon of symmetry breaking but once it was clear that there were fields of the maximal type which didn’t obey the axioms, then the way was opened to introducing these fields of this type into the kind of theory which Nambu started of symmetry breaking and that’s essentially what happened to me over a weekend during which I gradually realised that I knew two things which had to be brought together. It was related to the fact that I had read papers not long before by Julian Schwinger who was one of the people who shared the quantum electrodynamics prize and that was -65 I think. He had a way of formulating that theory which was a little bit different from what most people preferred. It resulted in some equations which were explicitly  violating, apparently violating the rules of Einstein relativity theory but the physics was not affected by this, it was just a peculiarity of the formal mathematics and so it was my recollection of equations written by Julian Schwinger which made me see that this was what had to be done. But it was a process which wasn’t sudden, it was during the weekend and I had to go back to my office on the Monday and check that I hadn’t made a mistake about this.";33;Creativity
Who is your role model, and why?;"Peter Higgs: In my high school days I didn’t find the physics that I was taught very interesting. I was better at mathematics and chemistry, my scientific subjects, and I was quite enthusiastic about chemistry, understanding the structure of matter of the molecular level. Gradually I came to know that there were deeper levels and that these were classified as physics and there were interesting things to do in theoretical physics there. One of the influences on me which probably a former pupil at the same school of about a quarter of a century earlier, Paul Dirac, who was one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920’s, and I was curious about what he had done because his name appeared frequently on the roll call of the achievements of former pupils. I was curious and that led me to read about atomic physics and quantum theory before I was ever taught them.
The only other thing perhaps to add about influences in my days at high school was that at the end of my time there, it was very soon after the end of the war and the dropping of the bombs on Japan. I went to some public lectures in the University of Bristol organized by the two professors of physics, one theoretician and one experimentalist. These were lectures for the public to tell them what was the background of the development of these bombs and it was a great success series of lectures. The experimental physicist was Cecil Powell who worked in experimental particle physics, in those days it involved sending packages of photographic emulsion up into the upper atmosphere with the help of balloons, and he decided to give some lectures about his own work which I then went to when I learned from him a lot about the current state of experiment in particle physics and that helped me to see what I wanted to do.";33;Mentors (Role models)
What were you doing when you got the message of being awarded the Nobel Prize?;Peter Higgs: When the prize was announced I wasn’t at home and that was deliberate, I wasn’t trying to avoid the people from the Nobel Foundation or the Academy, but I was trying to avoid media attention which I expected would follow very rapidly. So I made sure to go out at 11 in the morning with the expectation that the announcement would be maybe 11.30 or something like that and I also went down to the harbor area Edinburgh for a lunch, went to an art exhibition and came back home at about 3 o’clock and I was told the news first by a former neighbor who stopped her car which overtook me as I was walking home and came across the street and said “Congratulations, my daughter phoned me from London to tell me about the award” and I said “what award?”. She gave me the answer I expected so I then went home and listened to my phone messages.;33;Impact of Nobel prize on you

I suppose that one could make some complicated joke about the pace of the recession and all these lights and the astronomers, but we won’t go there. You are here because you made this remarkable discovery about 15 years ago, that the expansion of the universe is accelerating and up until that point people had thought that the expansion of the universe was either preceding at a steady rate or might be slowing down. And yet this remarkable discovery was welcomed by the committee, people didn’t say ”No, this can’t be” but rather they said ”Yes”. Why? Why did they accept it?;"Saul Perlmutter: I think it was in this particular case there were two things going for us, and I will say one of the fastest acceptances of a breakthrough question, breakthrough issue in science topic. But the two things where one is that there were two teams that were gaining these results so the fact that both Brian’s, Adam’s team and my team were saying the same things and we were known to be in a very tough competition with each other and that we would have been very happy to call each other out, make a mistake. That, I think, was one of these cases where they got an immediate confirmation instead of having to wait for the years it would often take for another team to make a confirmation. That was one of the practical aspects of it. There was also a part; it certainly made a lot of other problems fit, so suddenly things fell into shape. I am sure we had all been hearing many complaints and worries about how is it that the universe is younger than the oldest star and these other issues that were floating around and suddenly those went away.
Brian P. Schmidt: There was a very strong theoretical view of how the universe should be. As an observer I just said ”They have it wrong” but it turns out this theoretical view of what the universe should be like was sort of confirmed by the observations of the accelerating universe. That section of the community I think were very happy to see it. Whereas the observational side, the people who actually go out and make experiments like to have things be as simple as possible. I think it was more skepticism on that side but the joint teams finding the same thing I think helped erode a little bit of that skepticism from that side of the community.
Adam G. Riess: Just to follow up on what Brian was saying with this theoretical preference. The preference was that there would be a certain amount of energy or matter in the universe and so we kept looking for the matter. After a while of looking we could only find about 30% of it, there was a hook that if we looked further out, we would finally find it. We didn’t but what we found was the other 70%. It was in a funny form, this funny kind of energy that we call dark energy. As difficult as it was to understand some theorists were kind of happy that they said “Well, anyway you complete the picture, we are happy to get to the 100%”.
Saul Perlmutter: I mean, it is funny because I think there was one group of theorists that I think were telling us ”Why are you bothering to do this measurement when you already know what the answer is going to be” whereas most of the observers in the world at that time would say ”Well, you can’t trust the theorists, they have been telling us all sorts of things that turned out to be wrong once we actually did the measurement.”";36;Research
You have described it before as the slowest ‘Aha’ moment in history perhaps, but you were coming to this realization that you were going to have a result that you were not expecting. How did you individually deal with it because the world welcomed it when it came out but as you were analyzing the data and beginning to see that this result … were you doubtful, were you thinking this is not what we should be seeing, there is something wrong?;"Adam G. Riess: I just thought it was wrong, but just it was going to be wrong for a simple or done reason. We would say a math error or any sophistical analysis that usually means a bug in a computer program. But that it would be wrong for that reason and as it evolved I started thinking maybe at least it is wrong for an interesting reason, something you know we won’t kick ourselves and say ”We should have known that”. I am pretty amazed that it survived to this day at face value of what we thought it was.
Saul Perlmutter: I guess there is the other element which is that there is a chain of analyses that we all have to do and many steps in that chain you have to calibrate. In the very first days of the measurement when you first put the chain together you often put the chain together and put the point in the plot just to make sure, to show that the chain all holds together and works. And then you plan to go back and fix, tune each of the different calibration steps along the way to make sure that you got all your i’s dotted and your t’s crossed. We also, I think, in the very early stages thought that, as we started to put back all the calibrations, the plot would home in to something more sensible and of course as we did those checks, it just homed in more nonsensible.
Adam G. Riess: I think the flavor of our analysis was different. I think we had our tool kit and we were going to take the data through that and see the answer at the end. And when we saw it, we were kind of stuck only with ”Maybe we made a mistake” …
Saul Perlmutter: So you had pre-calibrated everything?
Brian P. Schmidt: We had pre-calibrated everything. We really just wanted ‘dun, dun, dun’ and then ‘katching’ and you were like ”Oh, that is not so good, let’s go through each step again and what went wrong?”. So that was me, I just said ”Ahh, alright where did we mess up?”
Saul Perlmutter: But you should say that most what a scientist does, I think, is look for your own mistakes. That is not unusual, that you are spending a lot of your time trying to figure out ‘Is what I have done today correct? Is what I did last month correct?’ Sometimes this notion that you get asked the question What did you set out to prove? I don’t think any of us set out to prove anything in these things. We were just going out to make a measurement and making measurements are hard.
Brian P. Schmidt: We were trying to prove was the universe slowing down a little or was it slowing down a lot. You had gone through the idea of testing this, we knew we could do that but I kind of figured that that was a irrelevant question. Indeed, I was a referee of a paper he did where he asked this question and one of my comments as a referee was ”Fine, but it is not” … There was a figure where if the universe was not accelerating then we couldn’t really show too much about how much of this dark energy there was. What I had ignored was if the universe really was accelerating you could actually tell that. So, I went in with such a strong bias that I said ”This is an irrelevant experiment cause it would have been. If the universe wasn’t accelerating, we wouldn’t have been able to say anything interesting”. But I had failed to grasp that if the universe really was weird the experiment could show that. I was a bad referee.";36;Creativity
Yes, indeed. Okay, so we do apparently live in a universe that is speeding away from itself faster and faster. Does that mean that that will never stop, can we say that yet? Can we say that it is just going to carry on accelerating or do we not know?;"Saul Perlmutter: Until you understand why it is accelerating today, you can’t really make good predictions about what it will do in the future. Particular if one of the answers is true, if it turns out to just be a cosmological consonant as Einstein had put it in the equations then you would expect it to go accelerating forever. But if it turns out to be something more like the clause of that very first fraction of the second acceleration in an inflationary universe, we know that decay away. And then it would turn into a deceleration after that and in which case this one could perfectly well decay away and we could be left with deceleration in the future. Until we have evidence that will point us to which explanation is right, I think it is going to be very hard for us to make our, what we would thought was going to be very solvable prediction for the fate of the universe when we are all set out for this.
Brian P. Schmidt: Although that being said, that’s being ultra-cautious. Okay, it is an ultra-cautious statement. The simplest part of what we have measured is that it is not decaying away right now, so it is behaving very much like Einstein’s cosmological constant which is energy fixed with space. Although a theorists could make the universe do a right turn and turn on a very small piece of ground, that is not a simple explanation. The simplest explanation is yes, that the universe is going to keep doing this for long enough that it will sort of make the universe disappear from us. That is the simplest explanation. It is not iron cloud but I would probably wind up bet some money on it, I would certainly wind up to bet my hamster on it.";36;Future Research
Do you have a hamster?;"Brian P. Schmidt: No, I don’t.
Adam G. Riess: If he loses the bet, he will have to get one.";36;Free time
So how close are we to saying anything truly meaningful about dark energy and what it is, if dark energy is the all-embracing term for what it is that is pushing the universe apart? How close are we to knowing?;Adam G. Riess: There is sort of an observational and theoretical answer to that question. I think what we all are hoping is that a deep theoretical idea comes along, sort of like when Einstein revitalised gravity with his general relativity. That people say ”Wow, oh my gosh, that has to be right and that explains everything.” And I think we can learn at this point far more about dark energy by that path if it happens, on the other hand you can wait around forever and the next Einstein couldn’t come along. Then we are collecting these observational clues and the biggest clue is, as Brian was describing, if we could test and actually rule out that it is Einstein’s cosmological constant. If we do see a changing with time another possibility is that we saw the behavior of dark energy changing on scale. Changing when you look on the scale of clusters of galaxies versus the whole universe. If you saw different behavior then you might expect that there is a scale, we say scale dependence, which would mean general relativity which has no scale dependence, might not be the right theory.;36;Future Research
Unless you design your next experiments, how much interplay is it there with the theorists? Are the theorists dictating where you are going or are you basically just …?;"Saul Perlmutter: They are not giving enough direction where to go at this stage, so far they are just telling us “Just give us something to go on” and they have been laying ideas all over the terrain in case we happen to go in that direction with our data.
Brian P. Schmidt: But they are haven’t really given us a lot of space to go through brilliant new ideas: ”Try this!” We really are kind of feeling our way through the dark at this point and it has been a little, it is a bit frustrating I guess , it is frustrating for them too because they just keep on beating their heads against this brick wall, it is like ”Why is this stuff there and no one really has got an insight?”
Adam G. Riess: In fact, I would even go further, some theorists have actually reached an explanation or point where they would say it is beyond our ability to measure. Many theorists now subscribe to this point of view that there is a multiverse – there are many disconnecting universes. Each with their own value of this dark energy and that rather than being able to understand a deep reason why ours is as it is, nature rolls the dice every time one of these universes is born. We got a value that is reasonable enough to allow life to form and the disappointing thing to us experimentalists is there is no prediction. There is no experiment, there is nothing to say “Well, if that is right then we ought to go look for something” so that is almost the opposite of helpful.
Brian P. Schmidt: Well, it is a metaphysical argument.
Saul Perlmutter: Some say that we probably won’t really accept that theory, or that set of theories until they do provide some prediction that we can go test as a …
Brian P. Schmidt: One would hope that idea of there being millions or billions of universes out there, that there would ultimately be some prediction in our own universe that we could make.
Saul Perlmutter: Or else it is just philosophy here.
Adam G. Riess: Some say they are satisfied enough that it is Einstein’s cosmological constant, that we should stop, we will never find evidence. I think our view as observers is any time we can think of an experiment to look at the universe in a way it hasn’t been looked at before or to a precision that it hasn’t been looked at before: it behoves us to do that because after all, in 1998 we were pretty surprised. We didn’t listen to people who said …
Brian P. Schmidt: “We know the answer” that’s right.";36;Research
I wanted to ask about the climate for doing your research because in these days when there is a certain amount of cutback on space research, is it the same for astronomy or is astronomy in a flowering time?;"Brian P. Schmidt: I think it depends on where you are at. For example, United States and Australia are at very different spaces right now. Australia is spending lots of money on astronomical research fundamentally looking at the square kilometer ray, which is a next generation radio telescope which the government is very excited about so they have put quite a bit of effort in. Maybe you guys want to explain the US situation.
Saul Perlmutter: Of course. I think the US world at this moment happens to be a pretty difficult political scene to try to build anything new and in general of course people are mostly focusing on cutting back at this stage, but it is also true that during times of cutback often you need to try to figure out what are our prime targets? Is there some area where we should make sure we don’t lose that field and I think maybe people are optimistic that things like this Nobel Prize and actually there have been a number of very influential decades of survey style reports will help focus funding so that it will at least preserve some of the fields that are looking very brightly at the moment.
Adam G. Riess: I think the key word is focus for the US portfolio now. I mean we are finishing building the James Webspace telescope which is going to be a big large flagship like the Hubble space telescope but that may be the last of its line. And everything after that is going to have to be focused and smaller scale and targeted, and I think we are hoping that dark energy falls into that camp. It was the number one recommendation of the decadal survey to build a focus mission on dark energy. The Europeans are also planning a mission like that as well.";36;Future research (interests)
You mentioned frequent flyer miles before we started. Does travelling around the world take up a lot of your time?;"Brian P. Schmidt: Specially in Australia, it is a problem. We have all to go to observatories and things, I mean Adam is more of a space telescope guy, but he does go observe as well. Saul and I will know tripsing back and forth to observatories and to meet your colleagues. It is a very international field so, but all of our teams had people on I think five continents between the two of us so you can only do certain much on the phone. At some point you got to get meet people in the flesh and get stuff done.
Saul Perlmutter: Besides this amazingly interactive social human activity you really have to talk together and work together. It is funny that still video conferencing isn’t good enough.";36;Life
Does you work lend itself to this cloud approach where you just put it out to humanity not just the specialists, but you allow other people to get involved?;"Saul Perlmutter: It hasn’t happened that much yet except in one particular domain which is that the average astronomers have been quite successful over the years in supernova work. They were the ones originally who found the supernova for us. Today, there are these things as galaxy zoos where they distribute images and then they let the world go loose on trying to classify things, so that particular area happens to be very successful. Some supernova research has been done that way.
Brian P. Schmidt: I am actually with one of my new surveys going to be using that because I don’t have the capacity to find things really quickly and confirm them, so we are going to be crowdsourcing, as they say, so people will go through and for example when we are looking at nearby galaxies and we have a supernova go off that is really young like hours old. Rather than me wait up in the morning and see if it is real before I start telling everyone the crowdsourcing can do that for me so it is our hope that we can use that.";36;Creativity
And on this subject of engagement, I was interested what made you become astronomers in the first place? Because everybody on the planet spends time looking up at the stars wondering, few make that their lives. But I would think lots of people would think it was a very appealing thing to do. What made you do it?;"Brian P. Schmidt: In my case I always knew that I was going to be a scientist – my father was a scientist and I loved science. What made me go into astronomy itself – well, I didn’t really know what to do when I finished high school, I had dabbled in astronomy, I hadn’t done a lot of it, I dabbled in it. And I suddenly realized that I had to figure out what I needed to do at university. I said “Jeez, I don’t know what I want to do! What would I do for free? Hm, I would do astronomy for free”, so I figured I would start my astronomy career figuring I would get trained up and I would ultimately do something else, so it was really quite a holding paddle for me.
Saul Perlmutter: You already had a backyard telescope experience as a child?
Brian P. Schmidt: I had a little telescope as a child, I was interested in it, but I wasn’t obsessed. You know, some of my friends were really obsessed, knew every constellation, everything. Naw, it was something I did a bit of, but you know very part time.";36;Motivation
"So unfortunately we are running short of time but I just wanted to ask before we stop; what do you say to young students coming in to the lab or to the telescope and saying: What should I be doing in the future? What are the good questions? What advice do you give?";Adam G. Riess: Students who are first coming, they don’t know exactly what the best areas to research are so first you do start in the big picture, the high level, you say: You know we found the universe is accelerating but we don’t understand why. There might be dark energy we don’t understand, something about gravity, this is the big question, but I have an idea for you, and it is to investigate this new technique or this way of doing it. I might also ask the student what their skills are, if they are interested in observing, if they are interested in theory or computer programming. But usually it is a marriage of the big picture and an idea I had in the shower last night on a technique and then you know we will see where it goes.;36;Advice for young researchers
I suppose that one could make some complicated joke about the pace of the recession and all these lights and the astronomers, but we won’t go there. You are here because you made this remarkable discovery about 15 years ago, that the expansion of the universe is accelerating and up until that point people had thought that the expansion of the universe was either preceding at a steady rate or might be slowing down. And yet this remarkable discovery was welcomed by the committee, people didn’t say ”No, this can’t be” but rather they said ”Yes”. Why? Why did they accept it?;"Saul Perlmutter: I think it was in this particular case there were two things going for us, and I will say one of the fastest acceptances of a breakthrough question, breakthrough issue in science topic. But the two things where one is that there were two teams that were gaining these results so the fact that both Brian’s, Adam’s team and my team were saying the same things and we were known to be in a very tough competition with each other and that we would have been very happy to call each other out, make a mistake. That, I think, was one of these cases where they got an immediate confirmation instead of having to wait for the years it would often take for another team to make a confirmation. That was one of the practical aspects of it. There was also a part; it certainly made a lot of other problems fit, so suddenly things fell into shape. I am sure we had all been hearing many complaints and worries about how is it that the universe is younger than the oldest star and these other issues that were floating around and suddenly those went away.
Brian P. Schmidt: There was a very strong theoretical view of how the universe should be. As an observer I just said ”They have it wrong” but it turns out this theoretical view of what the universe should be like was sort of confirmed by the observations of the accelerating universe. That section of the community I think were very happy to see it. Whereas the observational side, the people who actually go out and make experiments like to have things be as simple as possible. I think it was more skepticism on that side but the joint teams finding the same thing I think helped erode a little bit of that skepticism from that side of the community.
Adam G. Riess: Just to follow up on what Brian was saying with this theoretical preference. The preference was that there would be a certain amount of energy or matter in the universe and so we kept looking for the matter. After a while of looking we could only find about 30% of it, there was a hook that if we looked further out, we would finally find it. We didn’t but what we found was the other 70%. It was in a funny form, this funny kind of energy that we call dark energy. As difficult as it was to understand some theorists were kind of happy that they said “Well, anyway you complete the picture, we are happy to get to the 100%”.
Saul Perlmutter: I mean, it is funny because I think there was one group of theorists that I think were telling us ”Why are you bothering to do this measurement when you already know what the answer is going to be” whereas most of the observers in the world at that time would say ”Well, you can’t trust the theorists, they have been telling us all sorts of things that turned out to be wrong once we actually did the measurement.”";37;Research
You have described it before as the slowest ‘Aha’ moment in history perhaps, but you were coming to this realization that you were going to have a result that you were not expecting. How did you individually deal with it because the world welcomed it when it came out but as you were analyzing the data and beginning to see that this result … were you doubtful, were you thinking this is not what we should be seeing, there is something wrong?;"Adam G. Riess: I just thought it was wrong, but just it was going to be wrong for a simple or done reason. We would say a math error or any sophistical analysis that usually means a bug in a computer program. But that it would be wrong for that reason and as it evolved I started thinking maybe at least it is wrong for an interesting reason, something you know we won’t kick ourselves and say ”We should have known that”. I am pretty amazed that it survived to this day at face value of what we thought it was.
Saul Perlmutter: I guess there is the other element which is that there is a chain of analyses that we all have to do and many steps in that chain you have to calibrate. In the very first days of the measurement when you first put the chain together you often put the chain together and put the point in the plot just to make sure, to show that the chain all holds together and works. And then you plan to go back and fix, tune each of the different calibration steps along the way to make sure that you got all your i’s dotted and your t’s crossed. We also, I think, in the very early stages thought that, as we started to put back all the calibrations, the plot would home in to something more sensible and of course as we did those checks, it just homed in more nonsensible.
Adam G. Riess: I think the flavor of our analysis was different. I think we had our tool kit and we were going to take the data through that and see the answer at the end. And when we saw it, we were kind of stuck only with ”Maybe we made a mistake” …
Saul Perlmutter: So you had pre-calibrated everything?
Brian P. Schmidt: We had pre-calibrated everything. We really just wanted ‘dun, dun, dun’ and then ‘katching’ and you were like ”Oh, that is not so good, let’s go through each step again and what went wrong?”. So that was me, I just said ”Ahh, alright where did we mess up?”
Saul Perlmutter: But you should say that most what a scientist does, I think, is look for your own mistakes. That is not unusual, that you are spending a lot of your time trying to figure out ‘Is what I have done today correct? Is what I did last month correct?’ Sometimes this notion that you get asked the question What did you set out to prove? I don’t think any of us set out to prove anything in these things. We were just going out to make a measurement and making measurements are hard.
Brian P. Schmidt: We were trying to prove was the universe slowing down a little or was it slowing down a lot. You had gone through the idea of testing this, we knew we could do that but I kind of figured that that was a irrelevant question. Indeed, I was a referee of a paper he did where he asked this question and one of my comments as a referee was ”Fine, but it is not” … There was a figure where if the universe was not accelerating then we couldn’t really show too much about how much of this dark energy there was. What I had ignored was if the universe really was accelerating you could actually tell that. So, I went in with such a strong bias that I said ”This is an irrelevant experiment cause it would have been. If the universe wasn’t accelerating, we wouldn’t have been able to say anything interesting”. But I had failed to grasp that if the universe really was weird the experiment could show that. I was a bad referee.";37;Creativity
Yes, indeed. Okay, so we do apparently live in a universe that is speeding away from itself faster and faster. Does that mean that that will never stop, can we say that yet? Can we say that it is just going to carry on accelerating or do we not know?;"Saul Perlmutter: Until you understand why it is accelerating today, you can’t really make good predictions about what it will do in the future. Particular if one of the answers is true, if it turns out to just be a cosmological consonant as Einstein had put it in the equations then you would expect it to go accelerating forever. But if it turns out to be something more like the clause of that very first fraction of the second acceleration in an inflationary universe, we know that decay away. And then it would turn into a deceleration after that and in which case this one could perfectly well decay away and we could be left with deceleration in the future. Until we have evidence that will point us to which explanation is right, I think it is going to be very hard for us to make our, what we would thought was going to be very solvable prediction for the fate of the universe when we are all set out for this.
Brian P. Schmidt: Although that being said, that’s being ultra-cautious. Okay, it is an ultra-cautious statement. The simplest part of what we have measured is that it is not decaying away right now, so it is behaving very much like Einstein’s cosmological constant which is energy fixed with space. Although a theorists could make the universe do a right turn and turn on a very small piece of ground, that is not a simple explanation. The simplest explanation is yes, that the universe is going to keep doing this for long enough that it will sort of make the universe disappear from us. That is the simplest explanation. It is not iron cloud but I would probably wind up bet some money on it, I would certainly wind up to bet my hamster on it.";37;Future Research
Do you have a hamster?;"Brian P. Schmidt: No, I don’t.
Adam G. Riess: If he loses the bet, he will have to get one.";37;Free time
So how close are we to saying anything truly meaningful about dark energy and what it is, if dark energy is the all-embracing term for what it is that is pushing the universe apart? How close are we to knowing?;Adam G. Riess: There is sort of an observational and theoretical answer to that question. I think what we all are hoping is that a deep theoretical idea comes along, sort of like when Einstein revitalised gravity with his general relativity. That people say ”Wow, oh my gosh, that has to be right and that explains everything.” And I think we can learn at this point far more about dark energy by that path if it happens, on the other hand you can wait around forever and the next Einstein couldn’t come along. Then we are collecting these observational clues and the biggest clue is, as Brian was describing, if we could test and actually rule out that it is Einstein’s cosmological constant. If we do see a changing with time another possibility is that we saw the behavior of dark energy changing on scale. Changing when you look on the scale of clusters of galaxies versus the whole universe. If you saw different behavior then you might expect that there is a scale, we say scale dependence, which would mean general relativity which has no scale dependence, might not be the right theory.;37;Future Research
Unless you design your next experiments, how much interplay is it there with the theorists? Are the theorists dictating where you are going or are you basically just …?;"Saul Perlmutter: They are not giving enough direction where to go at this stage, so far they are just telling us “Just give us something to go on” and they have been laying ideas all over the terrain in case we happen to go in that direction with our data.
Brian P. Schmidt: But they are haven’t really given us a lot of space to go through brilliant new ideas: ”Try this!” We really are kind of feeling our way through the dark at this point and it has been a little, it is a bit frustrating I guess , it is frustrating for them too because they just keep on beating their heads against this brick wall, it is like ”Why is this stuff there and no one really has got an insight?”
Adam G. Riess: In fact, I would even go further, some theorists have actually reached an explanation or point where they would say it is beyond our ability to measure. Many theorists now subscribe to this point of view that there is a multiverse – there are many disconnecting universes. Each with their own value of this dark energy and that rather than being able to understand a deep reason why ours is as it is, nature rolls the dice every time one of these universes is born. We got a value that is reasonable enough to allow life to form and the disappointing thing to us experimentalists is there is no prediction. There is no experiment, there is nothing to say “Well, if that is right then we ought to go look for something” so that is almost the opposite of helpful.
Brian P. Schmidt: Well, it is a metaphysical argument.
Saul Perlmutter: Some say that we probably won’t really accept that theory, or that set of theories until they do provide some prediction that we can go test as a …
Brian P. Schmidt: One would hope that idea of there being millions or billions of universes out there, that there would ultimately be some prediction in our own universe that we could make.
Saul Perlmutter: Or else it is just philosophy here.
Adam G. Riess: Some say they are satisfied enough that it is Einstein’s cosmological constant, that we should stop, we will never find evidence. I think our view as observers is any time we can think of an experiment to look at the universe in a way it hasn’t been looked at before or to a precision that it hasn’t been looked at before: it behoves us to do that because after all, in 1998 we were pretty surprised. We didn’t listen to people who said …
Brian P. Schmidt: “We know the answer” that’s right.";37;Research
I wanted to ask about the climate for doing your research because in these days when there is a certain amount of cutback on space research, is it the same for astronomy or is astronomy in a flowering time?;"Brian P. Schmidt: I think it depends on where you are at. For example, United States and Australia are at very different spaces right now. Australia is spending lots of money on astronomical research fundamentally looking at the square kilometer ray, which is a next generation radio telescope which the government is very excited about so they have put quite a bit of effort in. Maybe you guys want to explain the US situation.
Saul Perlmutter: Of course. I think the US world at this moment happens to be a pretty difficult political scene to try to build anything new and in general of course people are mostly focusing on cutting back at this stage, but it is also true that during times of cutback often you need to try to figure out what are our prime targets? Is there some area where we should make sure we don’t lose that field and I think maybe people are optimistic that things like this Nobel Prize and actually there have been a number of very influential decades of survey style reports will help focus funding so that it will at least preserve some of the fields that are looking very brightly at the moment.
Adam G. Riess: I think the key word is focus for the US portfolio now. I mean we are finishing building the James Webspace telescope which is going to be a big large flagship like the Hubble space telescope but that may be the last of its line. And everything after that is going to have to be focused and smaller scale and targeted, and I think we are hoping that dark energy falls into that camp. It was the number one recommendation of the decadal survey to build a focus mission on dark energy. The Europeans are also planning a mission like that as well.";37;Future research (interests)
You mentioned frequent flyer miles before we started. Does travelling around the world take up a lot of your time?;"Brian P. Schmidt: Specially in Australia, it is a problem. We have all to go to observatories and things, I mean Adam is more of a space telescope guy, but he does go observe as well. Saul and I will know tripsing back and forth to observatories and to meet your colleagues. It is a very international field so, but all of our teams had people on I think five continents between the two of us so you can only do certain much on the phone. At some point you got to get meet people in the flesh and get stuff done.
Saul Perlmutter: Besides this amazingly interactive social human activity you really have to talk together and work together. It is funny that still video conferencing isn’t good enough.";37;Life
Does you work lend itself to this cloud approach where you just put it out to humanity not just the specialists, but you allow other people to get involved?;"Saul Perlmutter: It hasn’t happened that much yet except in one particular domain which is that the average astronomers have been quite successful over the years in supernova work. They were the ones originally who found the supernova for us. Today, there are these things as galaxy zoos where they distribute images and then they let the world go loose on trying to classify things, so that particular area happens to be very successful.

Schmidt: But they are haven’t really given us a lot of space to go through brilliant new ideas: ”Try this!” We really are kind of feeling our way through the dark at this point and it has been a little, it is a bit frustrating I guess , it is frustrating for them too because they just keep on beating their heads against this brick wall, it is like ”Why is this stuff there and no one really has got an insight?”
Adam G. Riess: In fact, I would even go further, some theorists have actually reached an explanation or point where they would say it is beyond our ability to measure. Many theorists now subscribe to this point of view that there is a multiverse – there are many disconnecting universes. Each with their own value of this dark energy and that rather than being able to understand a deep reason why ours is as it is, nature rolls the dice every time one of these universes is born. We got a value that is reasonable enough to allow life to form and the disappointing thing to us experimentalists is there is no prediction. There is no experiment, there is nothing to say “Well, if that is right then we ought to go look for something” so that is almost the opposite of helpful.
Brian P. Schmidt: Well, it is a metaphysical argument.
Saul Perlmutter: Some say that we probably won’t really accept that theory, or that set of theories until they do provide some prediction that we can go test as a …
Brian P. Schmidt: One would hope that idea of there being millions or billions of universes out there, that there would ultimately be some prediction in our own universe that we could make.
Saul Perlmutter: Or else it is just philosophy here.
Adam G. Riess: Some say they are satisfied enough that it is Einstein’s cosmological constant, that we should stop, we will never find evidence. I think our view as observers is any time we can think of an experiment to look at the universe in a way it hasn’t been looked at before or to a precision that it hasn’t been looked at before: it behoves us to do that because after all, in 1998 we were pretty surprised. We didn’t listen to people who said …
Brian P. Schmidt: “We know the answer” that’s right.";38;Research
I wanted to ask about the climate for doing your research because in these days when there is a certain amount of cutback on space research, is it the same for astronomy or is astronomy in a flowering time?;"Brian P. Schmidt: I think it depends on where you are at. For example, United States and Australia are at very different spaces right now. Australia is spending lots of money on astronomical research fundamentally looking at the square kilometer ray, which is a next generation radio telescope which the government is very excited about so they have put quite a bit of effort in. Maybe you guys want to explain the US situation.
Saul Perlmutter: Of course. I think the US world at this moment happens to be a pretty difficult political scene to try to build anything new and in general of course people are mostly focusing on cutting back at this stage, but it is also true that during times of cutback often you need to try to figure out what are our prime targets? Is there some area where we should make sure we don’t lose that field and I think maybe people are optimistic that things like this Nobel Prize and actually there have been a number of very influential decades of survey style reports will help focus funding so that it will at least preserve some of the fields that are looking very brightly at the moment.
Adam G. Riess: I think the key word is focus for the US portfolio now. I mean we are finishing building the James Webspace telescope which is going to be a big large flagship like the Hubble space telescope but that may be the last of its line. And everything after that is going to have to be focused and smaller scale and targeted, and I think we are hoping that dark energy falls into that camp. It was the number one recommendation of the decadal survey to build a focus mission on dark energy. The Europeans are also planning a mission like that as well.";38;Future research (interests)
You mentioned frequent flyer miles before we started. Does travelling around the world take up a lot of your time?;"Brian P. Schmidt: Specially in Australia, it is a problem. We have all to go to observatories and things, I mean Adam is more of a space telescope guy, but he does go observe as well. Saul and I will know tripsing back and forth to observatories and to meet your colleagues. It is a very international field so, but all of our teams had people on I think five continents between the two of us so you can only do certain much on the phone. At some point you got to get meet people in the flesh and get stuff done.
Saul Perlmutter: Besides this amazingly interactive social human activity you really have to talk together and work together. It is funny that still video conferencing isn’t good enough.";38;Life
Does you work lend itself to this cloud approach where you just put it out to humanity not just the specialists, but you allow other people to get involved?;"Saul Perlmutter: It hasn’t happened that much yet except in one particular domain which is that the average astronomers have been quite successful over the years in supernova work. They were the ones originally who found the supernova for us. Today, there are these things as galaxy zoos where they distribute images and then they let the world go loose on trying to classify things, so that particular area happens to be very successful. Some supernova research has been done that way.
Brian P. Schmidt: I am actually with one of my new surveys going to be using that because I don’t have the capacity to find things really quickly and confirm them, so we are going to be crowdsourcing, as they say, so people will go through and for example when we are looking at nearby galaxies and we have a supernova go off that is really young like hours old. Rather than me wait up in the morning and see if it is real before I start telling everyone the crowdsourcing can do that for me so it is our hope that we can use that.";38;Creativity
And on this subject of engagement, I was interested what made you become astronomers in the first place? Because everybody on the planet spends time looking up at the stars wondering, few make that their lives. But I would think lots of people would think it was a very appealing thing to do. What made you do it?;"Brian P. Schmidt: In my case I always knew that I was going to be a scientist – my father was a scientist and I loved science. What made me go into astronomy itself – well, I didn’t really know what to do when I finished high school, I had dabbled in astronomy, I hadn’t done a lot of it, I dabbled in it. And I suddenly realized that I had to figure out what I needed to do at university. I said “Jeez, I don’t know what I want to do! What would I do for free? Hm, I would do astronomy for free”, so I figured I would start my astronomy career figuring I would get trained up and I would ultimately do something else, so it was really quite a holding paddle for me.
Saul Perlmutter: You already had a backyard telescope experience as a child?
Brian P. Schmidt: I had a little telescope as a child, I was interested in it, but I wasn’t obsessed. You know, some of my friends were really obsessed, knew every constellation, everything. Naw, it was something I did a bit of, but you know very part time.";38;Motivation
"So unfortunately we are running short of time but I just wanted to ask before we stop; what do you say to young students coming in to the lab or to the telescope and saying: What should I be doing in the future? What are the good questions? What advice do you give?";Adam G. Riess: Students who are first coming, they don’t know exactly what the best areas to research are so first you do start in the big picture, the high level, you say: You know we found the universe is accelerating but we don’t understand why. There might be dark energy we don’t understand, something about gravity, this is the big question, but I have an idea for you, and it is to investigate this new technique or this way of doing it. I might also ask the student what their skills are, if they are interested in observing, if they are interested in theory or computer programming. But usually it is a marriage of the big picture and an idea I had in the shower last night on a technique and then you know we will see where it goes.;38;Advice for young researchers
I think it gets busier as it goes on. I want to start by discussing the subject of play. People often view science as a very serious exploit but it’s really quite playful and you in particular keep play at the forefront of your research activities. Can you tell me how play figures in your research?;Konstantin Novoselov: I came to do my PhD with Andre in 1999 and at first for me it was just an opportunity to work in some other lab, but I was so fascinated with the style of work that Andre imposed on the lab that I worked with him in the same lab since then. And it is really important that you Andre impose the style which promote the freedom of mind, you are just allowed to do whatever you want as long as it’s not boring, and for me I’m not sure if, even if we are not doing science in the eyes of other people, it’s nice, it’s enjoyable and that’s what I like.;39;Creativity
So, with the isolation of graphene which was done in this beautifully simple way just with sticky tape on graphite we are told. Was that the end of a long series of attempts to isolate graphene where this was just the last thing that one might try?;"Andre Geim: No, it was the beginning of a long series of serious experiments. Yeah so, it was very first try which turned out working and then it was okay a few years to hard work to clear it up.
Konstantin Novoselov: Andre is a little bit modest, in fact it was his idea first to create the metallic transistor and we thought about several possible ways and it was one of the possible ways and it did work. It was, although it sounds playful, it was quite a serious series and it ended up nicely.
Andre Geim: It’s probably doesn’t give the sounds okay what’s adventure and courage and so on, probably. What is important is, that when you are working within your specific direction you know all minor details of the area, you are aware about or control etcetera. The biggest adventure in doing different experiments, is to move into area where you are not an expert. It requires a lot of work to accumulate additional knowledge, read hundreds and hundreds of different papers and be courageous enough to enter in the area where you have not been before so, for me for example, in mid-nineties, I switched subject from semi-conductor physics to superconductivity. I went to those conferences as a beginner with having a couple of already prestigious papers being an associate professor and people looked at me and something like that, who is this mature post-doc, what his teaching with us. Because I came from a completely different community. It requires a lot of work and this sort of moving away, it’s not secure. You are moving in the unknown waters which is not only scientifically unknown but in terms of psychology, it’s unknown community. This requires a bit of adventure.
Konstantin Novoselov: It’s a great pleasure as well, if you are young like a student again because you were for a very short period of time, you got to learn so much that people will learn over decades and that’s a great pleasure.";39;Research
In this case it seems to be a successful melding. Let’s talk about graphene a little bit. It’s a single atomic carbon in a hexagonal lattice just one atom thick and its forming exists in this single atom sheets. It’s supposed to be the strongest material on earth is that correct?;Konstantin Novoselov: Well, let’s start from the beginning. Over the last seven years, people like to talk about how strong it is and how conductive it is and how probably useful it’s going to be for the electronic industry, but for me it’s just the very existence of it something which is only one atom thick can exist on millimetre or even inch size and be so perfect and it’s practically resolve any defect that you can actually pick it up and hand it in your fingers put it back and still it will work as a perfect transist. Just the very existence of this material is still very fascinating for me and then in addition to it, all the other properties that can come on top is the most, is the strongest material known to us, it’s probably the most conductive and we are so lucky with finding so many unusual electronic properties in it, on which we really specialize.;39;Research
Lovely, it’s great depth there to discover then. And it acts as a laboratory as well as a material which can be applied, and I understand you can do some very fundamental physics using graphene. So, it holds potential both for the expiration of quantum physics and for applications such as touch screens and alike. Are you interested in the entire spectrum of those things or do you tend towards one or other end of the spectrum?;Konstantin Novoselov: Whe’re generally interested in what is interesting whether it is, if it is applications which are interesting at this particular moment for us, then we do some particular part of the applications. Mostly, it just happened that physics is so fascinating in this material indeed as you said, electrons behave so specially in this material, they mimic relativistic particles, so you can produce experiments which were not possible with real elementary particles in the real world, and it allows so much freedom and so many different types of experiments that honestly, one can be lost. Myself and Andre, we often complained that these Friday evening experiments, which you were mentioning, are no longer active but in fact, when you think about this material it’s not true, we broaden the spectrum of our work in the lab so dramatically we now study, not only transfer properties that we are used to do, we also study mechanical properties and optical properties and chemistry and the interplay between those. That’s the overall, the spectrum of the experiments is probably even wilder than from the levitating frog to superconductivity.;39;Future Research
Is it difficult to choose what experiment to do, given all these possibilities?;Andre Geim: Well, circumstances force us to move in one area or another area, so you have a limited freedom of choice. Circumstances sometimes dictate, just for simple reasons, one area even was incorrect. /- – -/ research becomes so crowded, another area is still not exploited, you have certain possibilities with your experimental facilities, so, it dictates what you can chose and within this already limited choice of options you have to think what to do and then you poke in the right direction similar to this Friday night experiments. If the poke is unsuccessful after few days, few weeks, so even a few months, I usually say, let’s cut losses like on a stock market and do something else within this area. So, it’s always hard but at the same time we are forced into.;39;Creativity
So is it that you like to be first in an area, you like to seed in an area?;"Andre Geim: First is a waste when to many people working in the same area, secondly, possibilities are wider when you are in a new area and you are not afraid of being scooped because when you are in some area you have this feeling that you have to rush. When you are in some other area you can exploit in a better way and think about what you have found rather than try to publish in front of other people, so that’s much better. Feels much better.
Konstantin Novoselov: As in this sense, we were so lucky with our first paper on graphene, we had this privilege of working on it for more than a year. Our days it’s so competitive, we have to work much faster, and publish results within half a year probably.";39;Life
It’s interesting, people often talk about science is this great collaborative enterprise where there’s the enjoy partly is the give and take between all the participants in a particular research field and conferences and learning from each other and it’s a balance between that pleasure and having more space to do your thing in a less crowded field. So how does that work for you? How much of the collaborative enterprise do you enjoy?;Konstantin Novoselov: It is indeed a very fine balance and I’m still proud that Andre made this, I’m proud, that Andre made this decision when the very first paper was coming out that we didn’t try to patent this method or graphene or anything, we just invited as many people from all over the world with the task to joining us in this situation. People used this opportunity which increased this field dramatically and since then we enjoyed our collaboration and I hope that was the moment we set up the mood in the community because the community is incredibly friendly. We have so many very good collaborators, tough collaborators, but they are really fair collaborators and many of them are going to be here this week.;39;Creativity
I wanted to ask you about that decision not to patent, was that difficult;"Andre Geim: We actually prepared … it’s a well-known story these days, we actually prepared a patent on the basis of this first paper, our first paper, on graphene and it was with patent lawyers arranging a proper manner of speech and so on. And at that time when it was still with lawyers, I was at a conference, speaking with a representative of a very large multinational company, billions and billions of dollars, so you can guess which company this could be yourself. So, I told, we have this patent concerning graphene, it’s very expensive and troublesome to patent a whole area and possible sideway. Outcomes of this research, would be you interested in collaborating with us, we provide sort of ideas, you keep this patent running and also patent it whatever further comes, we are not very much interested in royalties, very tiny fractions of percent would be good if it ever comes to this one. And the guy told me, You know, we are aware about graphene, it’s a deep promising material, but we don’t think anything will come within the next ten years. If after, year eleven, we find out that this material is as promising as it is, I will put 100 lawyers on this project, each of them will file hundred patents per day and you’ll spend the rest of your life and the GDP of your little island, direct quote, “to try to sue us”. It is very arrogant and so on, but actually it was very useful to know this opinion because then I realised that there is no point of patent whole areas or visionary ideas, graphene electronics, graphene that, graphene this, you have to pinpoint some particular application and then you have a chance to do something otherwise its patent is just a general knowledge and there is no point in patent a general knowledge, so it was a useful comment despite of his arrogance.
Konstantin Novoselov: We should say, since then for several years, when ever came back to the idea of patenting anything so just, until recently. We were enjoying our scientific work only.";39;Dealing with difficulties
And then the application you chose to patent in, were what?;"Andre Geim: It’s about flourographene, two dimensional teflons, so I think it’s a bit narrow enough that it may stand a chance to bring some application in foreseeable future which might bring money to this project.
Konstantin Novoselov: We just loved the name two dimensional teflons.";39;Dealing with difficulties
So there has been some debate about whether graphene is two dimensional material or not. Do you think it is a two-dimensional material? Or is this debate in unlearned circles?;Konstantin Novoselov: I am not aware of these debates. Of course you can argue whether it is two dimensional or has some thickness or if you band it or fold it would acquire some three-dimension properties. When we call it two-dimensional, we call it two-dimensional in electronic terms, that electrons behave as being restricted to two dimensions only. Of course, for certain applications or problems, like the mechanical stability, flexural phonons, the repulse on the schiffer of graphene or in graphene, you might consider it as a three dimensional.;39;Research
So two dimensional teflon is to do what?;"Andre Geim: It’s fluorinated graphene to each cover atoms you have attached a fluorine atom, so that’s essentially the same graphene sheet with attached fluorine so it’s two-dimensional teflon. It’s an analogous molecule so a molecule of teflon is just a chain of carbons with the fluorine atoms attached, in this case we have a whole sheet of carbon which is graphene which is /- – -/ metric manner attached fluorine atom to each carbon.
Konstantin Novoselov: But we also seen as the demonstration of another idea, you can consider graphene as a two dimensional material, a two dimensional crystal, but you can also consider it as a giant organic molecule and then you can modify by chemistry and here you can for example attach fluorine to it and use it as an insulator for some applications if you want, but we hope that the idea goes even further. You will be able to modify it by other means as well and acquire some additional or some other properties.
Andre Geim: It’s a new type of chemistry we invented on the basis of graphene, it’s a giant giga molecule which you can modify. Previously, graphene was ‘peppered’ with different chemical molecules or dopes and so on, and in this case just like in chemistry, you take one molecule and you change it, in a very specific manner into something else, and in this case graphene was changed in very specific manner to something else, rather than peppered something else.";39;Research
So which applications are you most hopeful of seeing in use? From graphene.;"Konstantin Novoselov: Myself, the most hopeful of seeing applications which I haven’t even thought about, because up to now what we had, we just take this material, we figure out which particular properties are slightly better than in other materials like, for example mobility is a little bit better than in silicon, so we can use it for transistor application or transparencies, that would be better than in other material and we can use it for mechanic application. But for me the best one would be when you invent an application for this particular material, because it has this unique combination of very unusual properties; it’s being the strongest, the most elastic, the most conductive, the most transparent, so you just try to invent something for yourself. Now there is bendable electronics, quite fashionable and probably stretchable, electronics or I don’t know, but something like that which doesn’t exist yet, where we don’t use graphene as a replacement for another material for an application which is specifically created for graphene, that is what I am hoping for.
Andre Geim: Let us be clear, usually it takes decades for a material to go from an academic lab into industrial lab. It’s a very long way, involving many, many people before something originated from an academic lab comes to a consumer product. The Nobel Prize, at least as I perceive it, was not given for application, it was given, in my view, for bringing this material to the attention of a wide range of community, not even a single community of physicists, so it’s like a philosopher’s stone stand out to be of material whatever properties this material you touch, whatever properties you touch was this material, it turns out to be magic and applications is just an extra bonus to this project and we never expected that after five years, people would start talking about applications. It did happen and at the moment it’s a promise, a very strong promise for example, recently I was shown a graphene roadmap from Samsung and on this roadmap, there are, I don’t know, twenty, thirty, fifty different points. Each point means a specific application, which happens in a year, say 2012, 2025, and another axe it’s marked capitalisation in billions of dollars per year, so there are many applications, but let’s see, let’s wait for another 3 to 5 years before we will see first gadgets in a wider use.";39;Meaning of Work
I wanted to just go back to your scientific beginnings and ask you both why you chose to become physicists? What attracted you in the first place? Andre would you like to start?;Andre Geim: It’s always very simple, you are at school, you are doing one or another subject and I was much better in maths and physics than, say, in literature or in English. Okey, I got all high smart, but I was much better in physics and maths in particular. And then it is natural progression.;39;Motivation
And you both, now you both work, at the University of Manchester, there was a sojourn in the Netherlands and indeed you are the Dutch citizen. What drew you away from Russia and towards Western Europe?;Konstantin Novoselov: Before I start answering this, I should say probably that, it’s in principle quite natural for scientists to go from one place to another. There are of course circumstances as well, but it is natural, and it should be natural that you do your masters here, you go for your PhD elsewhere and go for a post-doc somewhere else. And that is how I moved from my university, Chernogolovka, to Holland and then in Manchester and I’m a little bit ashamed that I spend already, what, nine years now in Manchester and, it’s probably, I won’t say it now, that it is a good time to move and I’m a little bit ashamed of that. It’s a natural process, it helps in exchanging techniques, knowledge procedures.;39;Environment
Ok, thank you. To close, I’d just like to ask you both about each other. Maybe I should do when you are not sitting next to each other, but nevertheless, this is the opportunity. So, first of all, Konstantin, what is it that, you obviously have a strong partnership that works very well, what is it that you admire most about Andre’s work?;"Konstantin Novoselov: Andre is, was my supervisor, but supervisor is some cold term, so he’s my teacher. They teach you a lot about physics in the university, but they don’t teach you how to do science. You have to learn by yourself how to do science and it’s just, you only learn about it from someone. Andre got a very specific way of doing science and I’m really glad that I learnt exactly that way that you, first of all you are honest with yourself and you honestly consider the results of your experiments, the very pragmatic way of doing experiments and that has been since my PhD years and then through post-doc years, so I hope … We were always colleagues, that’s how he set up things in the lab, but I learned every day from him, also from other people in the lab of course, but I still learn a lot from him.
Andre Geim: I quite often hear from my colleagues who say, my PhD student, my post-doc, my lab and etcetera. There is this style, if you ever hear my interview I never say ‘my’, I always say ‘our’, sometimes it’s misinterpreted when I say our lab interpreted as Kostya’s lab and my lab, in fact it’s our lab is a community of many people, PhD students, post-docs and staff members and so on. I do not distinguish between PhD student and staff member if they contribute to common work, to their best possible extent, if there is a new PhD student, he is coming and he becomes my colleague rather than anything else. All people are colleagues, but if, ok, of course there is a draw back from this as well, because if students doesn’t contribute, ok, I immediately ignore that. He can continue his PhD studies, but he is no longer a member of our group, because if you like my time to be contributed to your work, to your PhD, etcetera, you have to contribute back. It’s a small society if you wish and it’s very important to treat younger colleagues not like your property or your feudal property, like many of my colleagues still do, but consider them as younger colleagues.";39;Creativity
I think it gets busier as it goes on. I want to start by discussing the subject of play. People often view science as a very serious exploit but it’s really quite playful and you in particular keep play at the forefront of your research activities. Can you tell me how play figures in your research?;Konstantin Novoselov: I came to do my PhD with Andre in 1999 and at first for me it was just an opportunity to work in some other lab, but I was so fascinated with the style of work that Andre imposed on the lab that I worked with him in the same lab since then.

How much of the collaborative enterprise do you enjoy?;Konstantin Novoselov: It is indeed a very fine balance and I’m still proud that Andre made this, I’m proud, that Andre made this decision when the very first paper was coming out that we didn’t try to patent this method or graphene or anything, we just invited as many people from all over the world with the task to joining us in this situation. People used this opportunity which increased this field dramatically and since then we enjoyed our collaboration and I hope that was the moment we set up the mood in the community because the community is incredibly friendly. We have so many very good collaborators, tough collaborators, but they are really fair collaborators and many of them are going to be here this week.;40;Creativity
I wanted to ask you about that decision not to patent, was that difficult;"Andre Geim: We actually prepared … it’s a well-known story these days, we actually prepared a patent on the basis of this first paper, our first paper, on graphene and it was with patent lawyers arranging a proper manner of speech and so on. And at that time when it was still with lawyers, I was at a conference, speaking with a representative of a very large multinational company, billions and billions of dollars, so you can guess which company this could be yourself. So, I told, we have this patent concerning graphene, it’s very expensive and troublesome to patent a whole area and possible sideway. Outcomes of this research, would be you interested in collaborating with us, we provide sort of ideas, you keep this patent running and also patent it whatever further comes, we are not very much interested in royalties, very tiny fractions of percent would be good if it ever comes to this one. And the guy told me, You know, we are aware about graphene, it’s a deep promising material, but we don’t think anything will come within the next ten years. If after, year eleven, we find out that this material is as promising as it is, I will put 100 lawyers on this project, each of them will file hundred patents per day and you’ll spend the rest of your life and the GDP of your little island, direct quote, “to try to sue us”. It is very arrogant and so on, but actually it was very useful to know this opinion because then I realised that there is no point of patent whole areas or visionary ideas, graphene electronics, graphene that, graphene this, you have to pinpoint some particular application and then you have a chance to do something otherwise its patent is just a general knowledge and there is no point in patent a general knowledge, so it was a useful comment despite of his arrogance.
Konstantin Novoselov: We should say, since then for several years, when ever came back to the idea of patenting anything so just, until recently. We were enjoying our scientific work only.";40;Dealing with difficulties
And then the application you chose to patent in, were what?;"Andre Geim: It’s about flourographene, two dimensional teflons, so I think it’s a bit narrow enough that it may stand a chance to bring some application in foreseeable future which might bring money to this project.
Konstantin Novoselov: We just loved the name two dimensional teflons.";40;Dealing with difficulties
So there has been some debate about whether graphene is two dimensional material or not. Do you think it is a two-dimensional material? Or is this debate in unlearned circles?;Konstantin Novoselov: I am not aware of these debates. Of course you can argue whether it is two dimensional or has some thickness or if you band it or fold it would acquire some three-dimension properties. When we call it two-dimensional, we call it two-dimensional in electronic terms, that electrons behave as being restricted to two dimensions only. Of course, for certain applications or problems, like the mechanical stability, flexural phonons, the repulse on the schiffer of graphene or in graphene, you might consider it as a three dimensional.;40;Research
So two dimensional teflon is to do what?;"Andre Geim: It’s fluorinated graphene to each cover atoms you have attached a fluorine atom, so that’s essentially the same graphene sheet with attached fluorine so it’s two-dimensional teflon. It’s an analogous molecule so a molecule of teflon is just a chain of carbons with the fluorine atoms attached, in this case we have a whole sheet of carbon which is graphene which is /- – -/ metric manner attached fluorine atom to each carbon.
Konstantin Novoselov: But we also seen as the demonstration of another idea, you can consider graphene as a two dimensional material, a two dimensional crystal, but you can also consider it as a giant organic molecule and then you can modify by chemistry and here you can for example attach fluorine to it and use it as an insulator for some applications if you want, but we hope that the idea goes even further. You will be able to modify it by other means as well and acquire some additional or some other properties.
Andre Geim: It’s a new type of chemistry we invented on the basis of graphene, it’s a giant giga molecule which you can modify. Previously, graphene was ‘peppered’ with different chemical molecules or dopes and so on, and in this case just like in chemistry, you take one molecule and you change it, in a very specific manner into something else, and in this case graphene was changed in very specific manner to something else, rather than peppered something else.";40;Research
So which applications are you most hopeful of seeing in use? From graphene.;"Konstantin Novoselov: Myself, the most hopeful of seeing applications which I haven’t even thought about, because up to now what we had, we just take this material, we figure out which particular properties are slightly better than in other materials like, for example mobility is a little bit better than in silicon, so we can use it for transistor application or transparencies, that would be better than in other material and we can use it for mechanic application. But for me the best one would be when you invent an application for this particular material, because it has this unique combination of very unusual properties; it’s being the strongest, the most elastic, the most conductive, the most transparent, so you just try to invent something for yourself. Now there is bendable electronics, quite fashionable and probably stretchable, electronics or I don’t know, but something like that which doesn’t exist yet, where we don’t use graphene as a replacement for another material for an application which is specifically created for graphene, that is what I am hoping for.
Andre Geim: Let us be clear, usually it takes decades for a material to go from an academic lab into industrial lab. It’s a very long way, involving many, many people before something originated from an academic lab comes to a consumer product. The Nobel Prize, at least as I perceive it, was not given for application, it was given, in my view, for bringing this material to the attention of a wide range of community, not even a single community of physicists, so it’s like a philosopher’s stone stand out to be of material whatever properties this material you touch, whatever properties you touch was this material, it turns out to be magic and applications is just an extra bonus to this project and we never expected that after five years, people would start talking about applications. It did happen and at the moment it’s a promise, a very strong promise for example, recently I was shown a graphene roadmap from Samsung and on this roadmap, there are, I don’t know, twenty, thirty, fifty different points. Each point means a specific application, which happens in a year, say 2012, 2025, and another axe it’s marked capitalisation in billions of dollars per year, so there are many applications, but let’s see, let’s wait for another 3 to 5 years before we will see first gadgets in a wider use.";40;Meaning of Work
I wanted to just go back to your scientific beginnings and ask you both why you chose to become physicists? What attracted you in the first place? Andre would you like to start?;Andre Geim: It’s always very simple, you are at school, you are doing one or another subject and I was much better in maths and physics than, say, in literature or in English. Okey, I got all high smart, but I was much better in physics and maths in particular. And then it is natural progression.;40;Motivation
And you both, now you both work, at the University of Manchester, there was a sojourn in the Netherlands and indeed you are the Dutch citizen. What drew you away from Russia and towards Western Europe?;Konstantin Novoselov: Before I start answering this, I should say probably that, it’s in principle quite natural for scientists to go from one place to another. There are of course circumstances as well, but it is natural, and it should be natural that you do your masters here, you go for your PhD elsewhere and go for a post-doc somewhere else. And that is how I moved from my university, Chernogolovka, to Holland and then in Manchester and I’m a little bit ashamed that I spend already, what, nine years now in Manchester and, it’s probably, I won’t say it now, that it is a good time to move and I’m a little bit ashamed of that. It’s a natural process, it helps in exchanging techniques, knowledge procedures.;40;Environment
Ok, thank you. To close, I’d just like to ask you both about each other. Maybe I should do when you are not sitting next to each other, but nevertheless, this is the opportunity. So, first of all, Konstantin, what is it that, you obviously have a strong partnership that works very well, what is it that you admire most about Andre’s work?;"Konstantin Novoselov: Andre is, was my supervisor, but supervisor is some cold term, so he’s my teacher. They teach you a lot about physics in the university, but they don’t teach you how to do science. You have to learn by yourself how to do science and it’s just, you only learn about it from someone. Andre got a very specific way of doing science and I’m really glad that I learnt exactly that way that you, first of all you are honest with yourself and you honestly consider the results of your experiments, the very pragmatic way of doing experiments and that has been since my PhD years and then through post-doc years, so I hope … We were always colleagues, that’s how he set up things in the lab, but I learned every day from him, also from other people in the lab of course, but I still learn a lot from him.
Andre Geim: I quite often hear from my colleagues who say, my PhD student, my post-doc, my lab and etcetera. There is this style, if you ever hear my interview I never say ‘my’, I always say ‘our’, sometimes it’s misinterpreted when I say our lab interpreted as Kostya’s lab and my lab, in fact it’s our lab is a community of many people, PhD students, post-docs and staff members and so on. I do not distinguish between PhD student and staff member if they contribute to common work, to their best possible extent, if there is a new PhD student, he is coming and he becomes my colleague rather than anything else. All people are colleagues, but if, ok, of course there is a draw back from this as well, because if students doesn’t contribute, ok, I immediately ignore that. He can continue his PhD studies, but he is no longer a member of our group, because if you like my time to be contributed to your work, to your PhD, etcetera, you have to contribute back. It’s a small society if you wish and it’s very important to treat younger colleagues not like your property or your feudal property, like many of my colleagues still do, but consider them as younger colleagues.";40;Creativity
It’s been two months since the Nobel Prize was announced. How has the two months been?;"Charles Kao: It seems that it just came.
Gwen Kao: It seems like it’s a short while ago";41;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Has it been welcome attention? Have you enjoyed all the …?;Gwen Kao: Yes and no right? Media, the Chinese media gets a little too much. They are overexcited.;41;Impact of the Nobel on you
Were you certain that it would work? Did you know when you were doing the experiments that this was going to work?;Charles Kao: I think that maybe I am feeling that I should do it and try to make it more easier.;41;Creativity
Did people believe you then?;Charles Kao: Some parts yes and it’s very nice also. I don’t know what I can put big way of saying.;41;Creativity
What made you interested in science originally? Were you a scientist when you were a little child?;Charles Kao: I did quite a lot of things that or which were given by people really doing, making … we have to sort of try to see how we can do and make very good way of making it so good that we know they can serve the thing easier because these things, for me, I feel always that I like.;41;Creativity
What drew you to physics? Why do you like physics and engineering?;"Charles Kao: Physics is good, but I sort of made it very much easier.
Gwen Kao: Why? Because his parents discovered these dangerous experiments with chemistry and threw all his stuff away including a bottle of cyanide, I understand. I don’t know how his parents disposed of it.
Charles Kao: That one he actually…
Gwen Kao: Anyway, his parents confiscated it all.";41;Motivation
Did you know, when in 1970 and there abouts, when you saw the fibers coming out of Corning and you could see that you were getting varied long range of transmission of information. Did you realise then how important it would be?;Charles Kao: Yes, I think I made very definite thing that one has to be done using the flying … and these things also, all these things coming in really makes it very nice to do that sort of work.;41;Research
Not mostly pride, mostly excitement maybe. This week is going to be a busy week. Are you looking forward to so much activity over the coming four five days?;Gwen Kao: I think he is enjoying himself.;41;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Who, or what, inspired you to enter your field of achievement?;Myself, and my desire to do something significant. To some extent it was also against the plan of my supervisor, but he was tolerant enough to finally accept my activities.;48;Future research
In one word, can you describe your reaction when you knew you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?;Well I knew that I had been traded as possible candidate years before. So the reaction was more like: “Ah, finally”.;48;Impact of Nobel on you
Has there ever been a time in your life and/or work when you have doubted what you were doing to the point that you seriously considered abandoning said work?;My research topics gradually changed all the time but I tried always to build upon knowledge that I had gained before. So for me it was very important to have continuity. I wanted to do good work which could be published in well-reputed journals. When I started my research I didn’t expect that finally there would be the Giant Magnetoresistance effect. It was only when we had found antiferromagnetic type coupling two years before the discovery of GMR that we thought this could be possible and installed the necessary equipment.;48;Creativity
First of all, congratulations! What will you do with the prize money? You have done something extraordinary to win the Nobel Prize – perhaps you deserve to spend it all on yourself!;Having been honoured so high on an international podium I see this Prize money as an obligation to be internationally available. The requests and demands are manifold. Believe me, it is not a comfortable life and often I have expenses which I pay for from my own pocket. So I see being a Laureate as a job which is paid adequately from the prize money.;48;How to Spend the Nobel money
At any given time you obviously have several questions in your mind that you want to find answers for in your research. How do you choose which ones to pursue first and spend most of your efforts on?;Yes, indeed I have had other ideas that could have turned out to be of importance or even a breakthrough. Whenever I have such an idea I make a corresponding note on the last pages of my notebook. But my nature is to concentrate only on one thing at a time.  Of course, when you start to have doubts that your project will be successful you play with other ideas also, and then I consult my notebook. Before giving up one should carefully test out all possibilities, but also not fall into stubbornness.;48;Motivation
I thought that perhaps we could start from the beginning, and I’d like to ask you how did you start in science? Dr Hänsch.;Theodor W. Hänsch: I grew up in the city of Heidelberg in a street called Bunsenstrasse, named after the chemist, Robert Bunsen, and we lived in the house that at one time had belonged to Robert Bunsen so as a child, being very impressionable, as I felt that being a chemist must be something important, because you get streets named after you. I asked my father what Bunsen had done, and he, the next day, brought home a Bunsen burner, or Bunsen burner, one of these gas burners that we hooked up to the gas stove in the kitchen. He would put table salt into it and the flame would turn yellow, and my father, who had worked at a pharmacy during the First World War, he knew other powders that one could buy in the pharmacy that would make the flame look red or green. He explained that the atoms have a characteristic colour that one sees there. So that’s something that stirred my interest and my fascination in light and atoms, at the age of six or seven.;51;Motivation
Did you ever think about becoming a scientist and winning the Nobel Prize?;John L. Hall: No, I have not considered that until the middle of the night a month or two ago.;51;Motivation
Did you think about a Nobel Prize? That you can make science so great? Did you ever dream about a Nobel Prize? Did you think that as a scientist …?;Theodor W. Hänsch: I was at Stanford University when in the early 1980s, -81, Arthur Schawlow, my mentor and friend and colleague for many years, when he was awarded a prize for work that we had done together, so at least I felt that the kinds of research that we’d been doing is not so far away from what they give Nobel Prizes for, and maybe I started to think about things like that. But getting prizes is not the reason why we do science. The joy comes from inventing things that allow you to do what could not be done before or from understanding something for the first time that nobody else has understood, and that’s the real reason why we enjoy science so much.;51;Impact of Nobel prize on you
How do you find the questions or the problems to make your research about?;Theodor W. Hänsch: I think it’s different for everybody. I like to play, I like to do experiments that require nice toys. I’m also very curious, so constantly new questions come to mind, and I don’t have a very long attention span. I follow my inclinations and every once in a while one finds something good.;51;Creativity
Are you also the kind of scientist that are playing around? With toys?;Roy J. Glauber: There’s an awful lot to do with play. I try and explain that in the elementary class I teach, that it looks as though we are just a bunch of kids doing demonstrations and playing with toys, but anybody who follows the psychology knows that playing with toys is the way kids learn about the world. It’s certainly the way we learn about the world. As far as the Nobel Prize is concerned, I’d like to add to what Ted has just said. The notion that one engages in science as a competition to win the prize is absolutely ridiculous, an even nasty, because what it does is to make failures of thousands of people who are doing the most constructive things they can. It’s, to some degree at least, accidental who wins the prize. It’s correlated, perhaps, with talent, but it’s correlated with contribution and everybody is trying to make contributions.;51;Personal Characteristics
Yes. But not everybody who’s playing is a good scientist, so I wonder, you have lots of students and young PhD researchers, can you recognise the talent, the exceptional talent? Can you see that?;Roy J. Glauber: We’re pretty good at. If you want to know where there’s competition, it’s to sign up the talent. It’s to gather in those talented people.;51;Competencies
How do you see that people are talented in science? How do you recognise that?;Theodor W. Hänsch: Sometimes in a ten-minute conversation, it’s just what makes them excited, what are the questions that they ask. It gives one a feeling. It’s not a science, it’s an art, but after dealing with so many young people I feel that I can decide rather quickly whether this is somebody I like to work with.;51;Competencies
So it’s very important to have the right personality somehow.  Can you tell us, Dr Hänsch, how you for the first time got the idea of the frequency comb?;"Theodor W. Hänsch: It’s a long story. Way back in the 1970’s at Stanford University we had a mode-locked picosecond dye laser and it already made a frequency comb that could be used to measure the distances between two spectral lines, but it was not a frequency comb that could be used to compare and upgrade the frequency to a microwave frequency and to make an absolute frequency measurement. That was just the technical state of the art, but in that context, together with my student, Jim Eckstein, we already worried about the phase slips from pulse to pulse, the shift that you could not really tell from the repetition frequency of the laser where the comb lines are, what one would need to do to find that out, but then we left it at that. Then in the early -90s, suddenly making ultra short pulses became very much easier with the invention of Kerr-lens mode-locking and titanium sapphire lasers. Suddenly, what required several PhDs, you could buy as a box and turn it on. We actually bought a femtosecond laser in 1994 for our laboratory, with the intention of trying to measure optical frequencies, but we didn’t go after it very seriously.
What I think was the point that triggered my intense interest was one afternoon in Florence, Italy, I was working with a young researcher, Marco Bellini, who had an amplified femtosecond laser and he would focus the light into a crystal plate and white light would emerge, which is common and used in many ultrafast laboratories as a broadband broad beam, and so I asked the question, and together we answered it. What would happen if we take our laser beam and split it in two and focus at two different spots? These two white light sources, will they form interference stripes? Is this rendered white light or is the face of this white light linked to the laser? We did that experiment, we saw beautiful interference stripes and that made me realise that it should be possible to make a train of pulses of white light pulses that have a comb spanning more than an octave, and then it’s easy to figure out where the comb lines are. At that time I wrote down a five or six page detailed proposal for what I had called a universal optical frequency comb synthesiser, and then we went to work with Thomas Udem and a little bit later Ronald Holzwarth to try and turn it into reality.";51;Motivation
This was this crazy idea, as I understand you Dr Hall, you didn’t believe that it was possible to realise?;John L. Hall: Another way to describe Hänsch idea or of Chebotayev’s explanation was something like, have something which produces white light and then do it 100 million times per second. Then no matter what’s the character of this, if it works the same each time then this light will have some comb character in it, and then, as Ted’s already mentioned, some issue of what the phases are. Combs have been used for a long time, I did my thesis with a comb. It was a commercial system produced for World War II, because there would be people on two teams and they would like to listen each to their home base and which frequency do I adjust this variable capacitor to? There would be a crystal and its harmonics could be found then by tuning the receiver.;51;Dealing with difficulties
How was your proposal received, then?;"Theodor W. Hänsch: I did not publish it. I had it witnessed by a few friends, and then showed it to some experts, including John and I think at that time John felt that was a goofy idea, he didn’t want to study it carefully.
John L. Hall: I agree with that.";51;Creativity
Almost 20 years ago. Can you compare the style of doing science in the States and in Europe? Is there similarities or differences?;Theodor W. Hänsch: In some ways it’s a different style. Of course, science is so international nowadays that we all meet at conferences, we visit each other and it’s no longer isolated, the US and Europe. Nevertheless, of course their styles are a little bit different. At Stanford, of course that was a hotbed of the creation of Silicon Valley, a lot of interesting people and a lot of excitement about innovation. In Germany, at least, I think innovation, people are at first sceptical, they feel life is good the way it is, why do you want to innovate? The spirit is, at least of the general public, is maybe not so enticing for doing research, but of course we live in our own world, in our circle of students and colleagues, who share our excitement. One thing that actually might be better in Germany, at least in the Max Planck Society, is that for basic research we don’t have to declare what we are going to do next year or the year after that, but we have a stable level of support, quite comfortable, that makes it possible to pursue also risky long-term research projects.;51;Environment
Do you recognise that? You have short-term financial?;John L. Hall: There is maybe less long-term investment made in the United States now, but it did exist. The Science Foundation was particularly visionary, and as well the Office of Naval Research, in accepting people and I think they are graded not by what they propose, but after some experience the men with responsibility for the money and the researcher on the other side have a respect and the money is transferred on the basis of thinking this guy hasn’t done anything fantastic for two years, but I guess he’ll do another thing like he did four years ago, and let’s give him money.;51;Meaning(Values) of Work
No? You are a theoretician from the beginning, and I have a question. What is the relation between the theory, the quantum theory of light, and your experimental work? Where do you meet?;"Theodor W. Hänsch: If you would like me to say something from my perspective. Roy is the one who explained how light can behave like a classical wave. Of course, we know since Einstein and Planck that light is made up of quanta of photons, so how can a laser wave behave like a classical wave? Roy was the first to explain that in mathematical terms, and to show that there are very many intriguing aspects of light that are lost if you think of it as a classical wave. Many correlation effects.
John L. Hall: And as well, if you think of it as only photons, you need them both.
Roy J. Glauber: Well, go ahead. You’re saving me a lot of trouble.";51;Future Research
It’s strange anyhow. Can it be that light is neither particles nor waves, so to say, it’s something that we just don’t have any idea …?;"Roy J. Glauber: I think that’s true.
John L. Hall: I think you’d need an operational discussion. What is the box you’ve put on the table that’s your detector, and if it registers clicks then you’re going to detect a photon character, and if it measures frequency then you’d see some other parameter.
Roy J. Glauber: It does depend on the experiment you perform, but that’s the fascinating thing about this entity. It has different faces, if you like, that it shows to different kinds of experiments.
Theodor W. Hänsch: The wave aspect and the particle aspects are things that we know from our everyday world. We know what are waves, and sound waves, and we know things like objects, but you’re certainly quite right, that the quantum world does not really conform with these classical concepts that we depend on, from which angle we look. It mimics particles or waves, but it’s something different altogether.";51;Research
If we go back to science, do you have any favourite problems that you would like to have solved, before you quit science? What is the dream ahead?;Theodor W. Hänsch: Something where we might actually have a chance to find an answer with the frequency combs, is whether fundamental constants are truly constant, or maybe it’s slowly changing with the evolution of the universe.;51;Motivation

We did that experiment, we saw beautiful interference stripes and that made me realise that it should be possible to make a train of pulses of white light pulses that have a comb spanning more than an octave, and then it’s easy to figure out where the comb lines are. At that time I wrote down a five or six page detailed proposal for what I had called a universal optical frequency comb synthesiser, and then we went to work with Thomas Udem and a little bit later Ronald Holzwarth to try and turn it into reality.";52;Motivation
This was this crazy idea, as I understand you Dr Hall, you didn’t believe that it was possible to realise?;John L. Hall: Another way to describe Hänsch idea or of Chebotayev’s explanation was something like, have something which produces white light and then do it 100 million times per second. Then no matter what’s the character of this, if it works the same each time then this light will have some comb character in it, and then, as Ted’s already mentioned, some issue of what the phases are. Combs have been used for a long time, I did my thesis with a comb. It was a commercial system produced for World War II, because there would be people on two teams and they would like to listen each to their home base and which frequency do I adjust this variable capacitor to? There would be a crystal and its harmonics could be found then by tuning the receiver.;52;Dealing with difficulties
How was your proposal received, then?;"Theodor W. Hänsch: I did not publish it. I had it witnessed by a few friends, and then showed it to some experts, including John and I think at that time John felt that was a goofy idea, he didn’t want to study it carefully.
John L. Hall: I agree with that.";52;Creativity
Almost 20 years ago. Can you compare the style of doing science in the States and in Europe? Is there similarities or differences?;Theodor W. Hänsch: In some ways it’s a different style. Of course, science is so international nowadays that we all meet at conferences, we visit each other and it’s no longer isolated, the US and Europe. Nevertheless, of course their styles are a little bit different. At Stanford, of course that was a hotbed of the creation of Silicon Valley, a lot of interesting people and a lot of excitement about innovation. In Germany, at least, I think innovation, people are at first sceptical, they feel life is good the way it is, why do you want to innovate? The spirit is, at least of the general public, is maybe not so enticing for doing research, but of course we live in our own world, in our circle of students and colleagues, who share our excitement. One thing that actually might be better in Germany, at least in the Max Planck Society, is that for basic research we don’t have to declare what we are going to do next year or the year after that, but we have a stable level of support, quite comfortable, that makes it possible to pursue also risky long-term research projects.;52;Environment
Do you recognise that? You have short-term financial?;John L. Hall: There is maybe less long-term investment made in the United States now, but it did exist. The Science Foundation was particularly visionary, and as well the Office of Naval Research, in accepting people and I think they are graded not by what they propose, but after some experience the men with responsibility for the money and the researcher on the other side have a respect and the money is transferred on the basis of thinking this guy hasn’t done anything fantastic for two years, but I guess he’ll do another thing like he did four years ago, and let’s give him money.;52;Meaning(Values) of Work
No? You are a theoretician from the beginning, and I have a question. What is the relation between the theory, the quantum theory of light, and your experimental work? Where do you meet?;"Theodor W. Hänsch: If you would like me to say something from my perspective. Roy is the one who explained how light can behave like a classical wave. Of course, we know since Einstein and Planck that light is made up of quanta of photons, so how can a laser wave behave like a classical wave? Roy was the first to explain that in mathematical terms, and to show that there are very many intriguing aspects of light that are lost if you think of it as a classical wave. Many correlation effects.
John L. Hall: And as well, if you think of it as only photons, you need them both.
Roy J. Glauber: Well, go ahead. You’re saving me a lot of trouble.";52;Future Research
It’s strange anyhow. Can it be that light is neither particles nor waves, so to say, it’s something that we just don’t have any idea …?;"Roy J. Glauber: I think that’s true.
John L. Hall: I think you’d need an operational discussion. What is the box you’ve put on the table that’s your detector, and if it registers clicks then you’re going to detect a photon character, and if it measures frequency then you’d see some other parameter.
Roy J. Glauber: It does depend on the experiment you perform, but that’s the fascinating thing about this entity. It has different faces, if you like, that it shows to different kinds of experiments.
Theodor W. Hänsch: The wave aspect and the particle aspects are things that we know from our everyday world. We know what are waves, and sound waves, and we know things like objects, but you’re certainly quite right, that the quantum world does not really conform with these classical concepts that we depend on, from which angle we look. It mimics particles or waves, but it’s something different altogether.";52;Research
If we go back to science, do you have any favourite problems that you would like to have solved, before you quit science? What is the dream ahead?;Theodor W. Hänsch: Something where we might actually have a chance to find an answer with the frequency combs, is whether fundamental constants are truly constant, or maybe it’s slowly changing with the evolution of the universe.;52;Motivation
Theodor Hänsch, welcome. We’re here in Lindau, on Lake Constance, for the Lindau Nobel Meeting, which gives young researchers from around the world a chance to mix with Nobel Laureates, listen to them and speak to them. What do you hope that the young people here will take away from this meeting? What do you think they can learn from this?;Theodor Hänsch: It’s a thrill, of course, to be at the meeting where so many Nobel Laureates whom one only knows as legends and from the literature, where they are there to touch, to ask questions, to get autographs. So it’s a special spirit, but I think it’s enjoyable also to the Laureates, because otherwise they wouldn’t come so many times. But it’s also an opportunity to try to transfer some of the enthusiasm and excitement that we feel for our science, to the young generation, because, after all, science depends on young people entering.;53;Advice for young researchers
Right, that’s very interesting. And do you know, I mean every, not every country in the world, but a very large selection of countries is represented here, do you notice big differences in the sorts of questions you’re getting asked by people from different regions, or …?;Theodor Hänsch: But still of course it’s also nice to see people from so many different countries. Some ladies dressed up even with a veil, only with a slit open for the eyes.;53;Environment
Auspicious beginning. But you played with chemistry as a child, and then at some point the budding chemist became a budding physicist. How did that transition happen?;Theodor Hänsch: Partly it had to do with an event that left me almost without hearing, and certainly without eyebrows, some mixture, I think, of red phosphorous and potassium perchlorate that blew up in my face.;53;Creativity
Perhaps your parents decided this too. Right, so you made a pragmatic decision to go for a safer subject. And you went to read physics at university in Heidelberg, and was it … I mean you had liked being an experimentalist with your hands, and you continued to be an experimentalist, was there ever a point at which you wanted to make the decision of whether you should be a theoretical physicist or an experimental physicist?;Theodor Hänsch: Well starting out as a student at the University of Heidelberg, the initial hard work was mathematics, and I started to admire the power of the mathematical formulas, and so clearly the thought crossed my mind, should I maybe do that? But I enjoyed so much experimenting, working with my own hands, being in touch with nature, whose laws we want to uncover, that I decided, no that’s maybe not the right choice for me.;53;Motivation
That’s a very nice way of referring to experimental science, being in touch with nature. And you felt that even then? You felt that experiments were leading … were uncovering truths for you?;Theodor Hänsch: Well I had done experiments as a hobby for many years, even before I decided that I wanted to be a physicist, and it’s been one of the sources of enjoyment, so I didn’t want to give that up. But also I felt that the formulas of mathematics, powerful as it may be, it can obscure the genuine nature of physical laws, and our intuitive understanding of course plays a powerful role. If I want not only to solve problems according to the book, but if I want to invent new tools, new directions, I need to develop some intuitive feeling, and as a theorist I think it’s harder to do than as an experimentalist.;53;Motivation
That’s interesting. So it’s by practising and playing that you develop ideas of how things might work, and you can just try them out? And theory is your back-up, in that case, I suppose, or maybe …?;Theodor Hänsch: So I might have an intuition that this is a promising direction, and once we start working of course then I need to do mathematical modelling and all that. But mostly it’s some more or less intuitive thought that starts it, the gut feeling that this might be interesting.;53;Motivation
I mean the laser is common or garden now, and we all see laser pointers, and everything, but then lasers were fairly new and do you remember your first encounter with the laser?;Theodor Hänsch: So lasers, I think the first visible laser was invented in … the first visible continuous wave laser in 1961, and in 1964 I saw my first laser in Heidelberg, at the University of Heidelberg, at the Institute of Applied Physics, there was Christoph Schmelzer who had plans to build a heavy ion accelerator using individual radio frequency resonators, and he wondered how to phase synchronise these cavities, and he had the idea that lasers, these new fangled devices, maybe would provide a way to send a synchronising signal along the accelerator. And so he had hired Peter Toschek from Bonn, a student of Wolfgang Paul, as an assistant, and when I saw my first laser he already had, I think, two students. The group was very small, but they actually had built a working helium neon laser, and to me this red beam was the strange speckled pattern that I had seen for the first time, it just seemed like a new world that I wanted to explore. So I told the people in nuclear physics that they shouldn’t count on me, I will start over at the Institute of Applied Physics.;53;Creativity
It must’ve been enormously empowering. And obviously it was, cause you stayed, the environment suited you. Do you think that it’s still the same? Is the environment in places like Stanford as it was then? Is it as easy?;Theodor Hänsch: I think it’s got more difficult, for instance to get research money, if you do fundamental research. In our days you could still get a lot of money easily, say, from the US Navy, and they didn’t require you to do any military work, one could just follow one’s ideas, and we didn’t have to write big reports, we just gave them a list of publications and they’d see what we’ve done last year. If you give us more money, we will do more of the same. OK, here, you have the money. Now I think many of my colleagues are complaining because they spend so much of their time writing proposals and reports. A typical NSF grant might be $100,000 a year, which is just barely enough to have a single graduate student. So I think it’s not quite the same in … but nonetheless I mean in a place like Stanford, still it’s a place where many excellent minds are working and it’s still a very stimulating environment.;53;Environment
And presumably that was in part then dictated by the fact that the Max-Planck-Institut would allow you to have that same kind of freedom of research that you’d known at Stanford?;Theodor Hänsch: Right. I think that, this combination really is what enticed me. Even the colleagues in the US envious for the amount of freedom we enjoy at the Max-Planck Society. It’s a society that is dedicated to basic research, so we don’t have to promise applications, we can follow crazy ideas, we can start risky projects, and we know that we have pretty much ensured funding for foreseeable years, even if after two years we find, oh, that was the wrong decision, we should re-group. So to have that luxury is something that’s fairly unique of the Max-Planck Society.;53;Environment
And Stanford was presumably the right place to be?;Theodor Hänsch: Right. There was the Homebrew Computer Club meeting every Wednesday evening at SLAC, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre, and people like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs were there. Of course he had no idea what they would be able to move. It was essentially a hobby organisation.;53;Environment
I love the name Homebrew, that’s nice, yes. It think it really captures it. But on the tool and the research, so you like playing and the tools enable you to answer the next question you want to answer?;Theodor Hänsch: Also I mean in the early days, unless you were extremely diligent, it was hard to find out what already had been done in a field, you would have to spend weeks in the library, there was no Google scholar. And I always felt that I make my life much easier if I start a new field where other people haven’t worked before, then I don’t have to go to the library and look up what has been done. And so by having tools that simply were not available before, one could take this easy way.;53;Life
So you eliminated the Doppler, and brought a more accurate picture?;Theodor Hänsch: Right, right. So in atomic hydrogen many of the old time physicists, they remembered that in the ’30s there was a big debate whether the Dirac theory would correctly describe the line profile of the red Balmer alpha line of hydrogen. And some people suspected that it doesn’t, and these suspicions led to the discovery of the Lamb shift, but with our laser we could see plainly resolved the Lamb shift for the first time in the optical spectrum. So that was one little thing. But there were many other things we could do. We could excite fluorescence in atomic gases at very low density. For instance, in sodium vapour we could work at temperatures, I think, of -50°C where there is one hundreds of an atom in the volume of sight, but we could see this, it was fluorescing. And a lot of other things followed. And so it really revolutionised in a way optical spectroscopy, and the trick to do it was exceedingly simple, so it was like once one knows it, one can build such a laser in an afternoon, and many laboratories did so. There were hundreds of laboratories that followed in the footsteps and built these so-called Hänsch design dilator.;53;Research
So I wanted to ask you which ones you’re most excited about, which ones are most likely to be realised soon?;Theodor Hänsch: It depends on whom you ask. In a way, I’m also an entrepreneur, I’m part of a start-up company that is actually selling frequency combs, and there I would have to say those are of interest to the largest number of people. But if you ask me as a scientist, well I’m interested in using combs to ask questions like, do we already understand quantum physics well, or are there some small level shifts that are not included in present day theories, or second stage Lamb shift? Our fundamental constants …;53;Research
So by reinvestigating spectra with greater precision, you’ll be able to reveal that, yes?;Theodor Hänsch: Our fundamental constants, or can we do laboratory experiments that would uncover slow drifts of fundamental constants?;53;Creativity
Fundamental constants have never had any drift associated with them, they are just … as far as everyone knows?;Theodor Hänsch: When they were named fundamental constants, people assumed that they must be constant, and on the other hand astronomers have speculated that spectral lines in the light of distant quasars, that they might carry some indication that the electromagnetic fine structure constant was a little bit smaller in the early universe than it is now. But of course nobody can go there and check what are the circumstances. But the rates of drift that they have speculated about should be of a magnitude that one can observe them in a laboratory experiment if you compare two different clock now, and again in a year or two years from now. And such comparisons have been made, and so far there is no evidence for any changing constants.;53;Future Research
So are they now widely accepted as the standard clocks, or is it still experimental?;Theodor Hänsch: Now there is a race who gets to redefine the second? And of course I believe that NIST would like to do that. On the other hand, I think for the clocks, it’s not just important that they are accurate, they should also be reliable, easy to work, easy to replicate, so that lots of people can have one. And I hope that the committees will hold back, that they won’t redefine the second too quickly.;53;Meaning(Values) of Work
That’s interesting, yes, cos then everybody is just left depending on one source, I see, yes. What about your commercial applications, what is your company selling these things for?;"Theodor Hänsch: I think most of the labs that are working on optical clocks, by now have bought a frequency comb from our company, there are 45 systems worldwide been sold. And of course we are looking for applications beyond precision clocks, so one project right now involves the European Southern Observatory, ESO. We are trying, also jointly with our research group, to make frequency combs fit to calibrate large astronomical spectographs. For that we have to thin out the comb spectrum.
Right now our comb lines are typically spaced maybe 100 MHz to 1 GHz, we’d like to have them further apart, like 30 GHz. And one way to do that is to filter them out with an external cavity, and we have already done some first steps in this direction. We brought one of our fibre based frequency combs to the vacuum tower telescope on the island of Tenerife earlier this year, and superimposed a comb to a solar spectrum, in the infrared range around 1.5 micron, and so you see all the nice Fraunhofer lines irregularly spaced, and then you see the comb spectrum very regular, like a ruler. And without any big analysis, immediately we could improve on the calibration accuracy that they are used to with this telescope. But the dream is that we can do much better in the future, and that you might be able to, for instance, watch directly the expansion of space with the evolution of the universe by taking some objects with certain red shift of the spectral lines, and see if this red shift itself drifts with time.";53;Donation
Over what period would you have to look to actually witness the expansion?;Theodor Hänsch: It depends how far away the objects are. But of course your hope is that this can be done with observations of months or years, or human scale times. But on the other hand I mean we could measure now, record it, and astronomers a century from now might go back to this data and try again.;53;Research
Would this be the first direct visualisation of the expansion of the universe?;Theodor Hänsch: Another thing that has already been done, is you could search for planets or distant stars, by looking at variable Doppler shifts of Fraunhofer lines of these stars. Because the star and planet, they really orbit around Earth, come with a centre of gravity, and so this has been successful in the search for Jupiter-like big planets. But if you can improve the accuracy with which one can calibrate these spectral lines, you might have a chance to discover Earth-like planets in distant solar systems.;53;Research
So with all this to do arising from that innovation, it’s perhaps surprising that you don’t stop there, but you go on. I mean your talk here, for instance, is entitled Quantum Laboratory On A Chip, and you’re moving into new areas, you’re constantly innovating. Is it just again the need to keep playing and keep experimenting?;Theodor Hänsch: Right, I think my approach has been, I want to be able to make mistakes quickly. So I don’t like to have large scale complex experiments. Some of my students, though, do, and some of my postdocs, so we are doing some of the serious research also, but in my own work I like to be able to improvise quickly, and if I see, oh, that’s a bad idea, move onto something else.;53;Advice for young scientists
What’s quickly? What defines quickly?;Theodor Hänsch: Say a week timescale, to get the first feeling whether an idea is feasible or not.;53;Research
And yourself, do you still go into the lab regularly and play?;Theodor Hänsch: I actually have my own lab. I have downtime at the University of Munich, the so-called toy store or toy lab, which has a collection of toys, I have to admit. But for me it’s the only lab where I know where everything is in the lab. So if a student works, if I need a screwdriver I spend 15 minutes to open all the drawers. In my own lab I know where the screwdriver is and which lenses I have, and where to find them. So I can try out things quickly, and I take advantage of that.;53;Life
And turning to the students, when you pick students to come and work with you, what do you look for in the people that you want to bring on?;Theodor Hänsch: Well of course I look at grades and letters of reference. Typically I talk to them for a while, I show them experiments. Other people in the group show them, and I try to judge from the kinds of questions they ask, and whether they show interest or not, whether they have the potential to be successful. And I think one indication is that indeed they can get excited about something, and that they have in the past done things like hobby holograms, or who knows? Just something that shows that science is indeed something that they enjoy.;53;Competencies
That makes sense. If you are looking around the world for people, though, how do you tap the resources that are now coming out of China and India, and things like that? Are you able to reach out to students worldwide and bring them to work with you in Munich?;Theodor Hänsch: We have students from different countries. We have a very good student from Japan. We have French students. Not so many from China, I think there are very good Chinese students, but in the past they would go to the US universities. But maybe that’s changing, in particular with the visa problems in the US.;53;Environment
I suppose that must be working to Europe’s benefit, yes, to a certain extent, yes. And a last thought, the students here at Lindau, would you have any particular advice to them that they should take away about managing their scientific careers?;Theodor Hänsch: I think it’s very important to find something that one is deeply interested in and that one enjoys. If they find something like that, they don’t mind working day and night because they’re obsessed. Then I thin they’re on the right track.;53;Advice for young researchers
Dr David Gross and Dr Frank Wilczek, my congratulations to the Nobel Prize. You have been waiting for a long time for this prize, how was it?;David Gross: 63 years!;54;Impact of Nobel prize on you
When did you realise that this was a realistic possibility?;"Frank Wilczek: I think when the experiments really started to crystallise in the late 1970’s and early -80’s, once that happened I thought it was possible. But they’re very conservative; they want to see very solid experimental evidence. They were telling in fact over lunch today they really wanted to see the curve with the arrow bars, so it took a long time for the experiments to catch up with our theories.";54;Dealing with difficulties
What was a crucial experiment?;"David Gross: There are many, it’s really been accumulation. It depends on who you talk to. Many of the original experiments were in 1974, enough to convince people, but then there were the discovery of jets which were really indications you could see quarks and then finally the discovery of jets where you could see gluons. Then, what Frank is really alluding to is the last, especially the last ten years with LAPP and then HERA where you have high precision tests, something I really never thought I would see, tests of detailed predictions and dozens of them to less than 1% accuracy, I still love to see them.
Frank Wilczek: David goes back a little bit further but even when I was a graduate student the concept that the strong interaction, this mysterious thing where the ideas were so vague and where you had the background of nuclear physics which has never become anywhere near as precise even now, that you would be talking about a few percent accuracy and these precise calculations just seemed completely off the radar screen, completely inconceivable. Just ridiculous.
David Gross: You’ll remember one of our mentors …
Frank Wilczek: Yes.
David Gross: … Sam Truman who told me about a month after we made this discovery and started to explore QCD [Quantum chromodynamics] he said, David this is a great theory and maybe you’re right but one thing I’m sure of it’ll never be proven.";54;Creativity
But you are a theoretician so there is not such a problem, if you can prove the idea then the idea is right?;"Frank Wilczek: If it’s an idea about the physical world you can have logical coherence and you can have aesthetic congruence, but it reaches an entirely different level when it describes the actual world, real phenomena, at least to me.
David Gross: Yes, and you could be wrong.
Frank Wilczek: Could be wrong.
David Gross: Believe me! I have been wrong, very rarely.
Frank Wilczek: I’ve been wrong maybe more often, but some of my best ideas have proved, what I think my best ideas have proved not to be right or at least not right in the original form they were proposed.
David Gross: There were other issues at the very beginning. Our advance was made on trying to understand what kind of theory could explain the behaviour of quarks at very short distances. The discovery of asymptotic freedom made it immediately clear that you could do that and calculate and test those ideas, but then the converse that the force became strong at large distances and led to the confinement of quarks that was still … When we very tentatively said that the fact that the force grows strong at large distances could explain confinement was very tentative and we had at the time no analogues, no other examples of that and it was such a crazy … I used to have arguments with a very famous physicist at Princeton, Eugene Wigner, for years and years and each time he would say, Quarks can’t exist because you could never produce them. The idea that you could base a theory on objects that you could never see directly seemed to most people – and even to us – dangerous. It took a long time, well, a long time, a few years at least, until one could see how this happened in toy models and then actually discover that there were analogues of that, analogues that people knew very well, like the Meissner effect in superconductivity that said ok well, now it’s not such a strange phenomena, there are examples in ordinary materials. Once those theoretical concepts were clear, I felt a lot more comfortable with the theory.
Frank Wilczek: It was very nervous making to be proposing a theory all of whose ingredients were unobserved particles and none of whose ingredients were observed particles.";54;Research
Do you still remember this feeling, how it is to get this crazy idea?;David Gross: It was exhilarating and scary because as Frank says it was clear from the beginning that the stakes were big, this was a big thing. Many of our smart colleagues realised this immediately and many were immediately convinced. But because the stakes were so big and the chances of it being wrong – as often happens – where none zero it was a little giddy and scary. As I remarked in my lecture, we didn’t have time much to think about it because there was so much to do, it just opened up, we got start calculating and physicist theorists really like to calculate. That’s the fun part of our business when you can …;54;Creativity
But the idea itself it was so crazy, was it like a revelation or?;"Frank Wilczek: It was putting together several, it wasn’t just one idea, it was really putting together several ideas that were formulated in different areas and then also ideas. After the central calculation there was a lot of work in working out its consequences. I don’t know if you’ll agree but I think in many ways the most important idea was not to worry about certain problems, just to go ahead and do the things we could do and not to worry about this problem of confinement.
David Gross: One couldn’t help to worry.
Frank Wilczek: Yes, but we probably didn’t do anything about it!
David Gross: I started to think about it. No, I started to think about it but, and of course being optimists. I originally thought that well, it’ll take us maybe three to four or five years to solve the theory completely. We still haven’t of course, it’s still on-going, a very alive subject to have analytic total control over the theory at large distances where it’s hard. It’s an enormously exciting field that remains. it’s hardly dead. The fact that it got a Nobel Prize does not mean that it’s over by any means, inuclear physics, QCD is still very much alive and exciting.";54;Creativity
It is about the future of physics. What is your favourite there?;"David Gross: There’s so many.
David Gross: Those are all fascinating things but the things that I really want to know the answer to before I disappear, have to do with the next goal of fundamental physics which is unifying the forces and also understanding the … We can push back the history of the universe to almost its beginning where everything breaks down, even this enormously ambitious and exciting and promising approach based on strength, breaks down so far as well. Something very deep is missing but we have a lot of clues and a lot of very surprising clues and I will be very disappointed if those questions aren’t answered in my lifetime.";54;Motivation
Do you think that string theory is the right way to get so far back in time?;"David Gross: Yes.
Frank Wilczek: It may be an important direction, I don’t know even know what string theory is but they’re clearly something important. It’s not a well formulated theory in a sense of QCD, with algorithms and clear-cut predictions, there are clearly some important ideas there.
David Gross: QCD is a revolution in the making and so we’re somewhere in the beginning or the middle or who knows where? But as Frank said it’s not yet a well formed … We don’t know what string theory is, in fact we’ve discovered recently that … Frank was somewhat conservative in his middle ages, he’s always been somewhat more sceptical about string theory than I, but we’ve now got the situation where string theory can’t be killed because certain of its aspects is almost the same as the theories that make up the standard model. It’s so continuously part of the physics of the standard model that it can’t be wrong, it might and it might very well be insufficient and at a conceptual level I’ve no doubt that in its present formulation or where we have so far got in understanding what string theory is or should be, its missing some fundamental new concepts. But it’s really not as we’ve learnt much to our amazement, any different than the gauge theories that we use to explain all the fundamental forces that so far observed.";54;Research
What concepts do you have I mind?;David Gross: What is space and what is time.;54;Career Devleopment
What is space and what is time?;"David Gross: What is space and time?
Frank Wilczek: I mentioned in my lecture yesterday how much physics and several Nobel Prizes in theoretical physics have come out of reconciling special relatively with quantum mechanics. String theory is one aspect perhaps or one attempt to reconcile general relatively with quantum mechanics which poses at least equal problems.
David Gross: Personally I really think that we’re in a pre-revolutionary state and that the next revolution that will deal with the deeper meaning of space and time, quantum space and time which is what general relativity is, and string theory already suggests some, will be greater than that of quantum mechanics because a deterministic view of the world was, is sort of what you naturally think of although it’s not so clear from talking to ordinary people. But our macroscopic view of space and time is truly built into not only to the way we lay people think about the world, but the way we formulate physics. Physics after all is supposedly the science of taking the present and predicting the future. If time itself is just an approximate concept which works for large time how do we formulate the laws of physics? For me it’s the most interesting question.
And you hope to hear the answer.
David Gross: I have very little faith that I will be able to answer that myself, but some young person might and I hope to be around to hear about the answer, yes.";54;Motivation
So, we have to wait like another four years?;"Frank Wilczek: Yes, that may very well happen on a timescale of three or four years, so well within our productive lifetime, so that’s a really exciting prospect.
David Gross: That might allow us to indirectly write test theories like string theory.
Frank Wilczek: Sometimes the crucial clues come from domains where they’re not anticipated, that certainly happened for QCD. The crucial experiments were these …
David Gross: Absolutely.
Frank Wilczek: … SLAC [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory] experiments which were not highly anticipated by the large body of theoretical community.
David Gross: Almost no-one wanted them.
Frank Wilczek: They were these kind of funny, no-one wanted to do them or think about them!
David Gross: My favourite example is the year of Einstein, 1905, he wrote three papers one proving the existence of atoms to even Ernst Mach’s agreement after Einstein’s work on Brownian motion Mach denied the existence of atoms, agreed that they must exist. He didn’t actually observe atoms, they didn’t have scanning, tunnelling microscopes, he explained a phenomena that was discovered by a botanist 50 years before the motion of little grains by the random movement of atoms. What more indirect evidence for atoms could you imagine but it was sufficient to explain, to convince the most die-hard, positivist of all Ernst Mach.
Frank Wilczek: It was very quantitative and non-trivial, that’s what made it convincing.
David Gross: I still have faith that if we had enough understanding of the theory which Einstein did at that time, of atomic theory, that we could indirectly test a theory like string theory but the theory has to do better. Unless, we can’t always rely on experimentalists to give us the clues.";54;Research
Now you know you received it, what is the difference before and after?;"David Gross: It’s a bit of a relief.
Frank Wilczek: It’s a relief. An honest relief, we’ll sleep better in October now and feel better about ourselves.
David Gross: I used to say October is, to paraphrase T.S. Eliot, October is the cruellest month!";54;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Dr David Gross and Dr Frank Wilczek, my congratulations to the Nobel Prize. You have been waiting for a long time for this prize, how was it?;David Gross: 63 years!;56;Impact of Nobel prize on you
When did you realise that this was a realistic possibility?;"Frank Wilczek: I think when the experiments really started to crystallise in the late 1970’s and early -80’s, once that happened I thought it was possible. But they’re very conservative; they want to see very solid experimental evidence. They were telling in fact over lunch today they really wanted to see the curve with the arrow bars, so it took a long time for the experiments to catch up with our theories.";56;Dealing with difficulties
What was a crucial experiment?;"David Gross: There are many, it’s really been accumulation. It depends on who you talk to. Many of the original experiments were in 1974, enough to convince people, but then there were the discovery of jets which were really indications you could see quarks and then finally the discovery of jets where you could see gluons. Then, what Frank is really alluding to is the last, especially the last ten years with LAPP and then HERA where you have high precision tests, something I really never thought I would see, tests of detailed predictions and dozens of them to less than 1% accuracy, I still love to see them.
Frank Wilczek: David goes back a little bit further but even when I was a graduate student the concept that the strong interaction, this mysterious thing where the ideas were so vague and where you had the background of nuclear physics which has never become anywhere near as precise even now, that you would be talking about a few percent accuracy and these precise calculations just seemed completely off the radar screen, completely inconceivable. Just ridiculous.
David Gross: You’ll remember one of our mentors …
Frank Wilczek: Yes.
David Gross: … Sam Truman who told me about a month after we made this discovery and started to explore QCD [Quantum chromodynamics] he said, David this is a great theory and maybe you’re right but one thing I’m sure of it’ll never be proven.";56;Creativity
But you are a theoretician so there is not such a problem, if you can prove the idea then the idea is right?;"Frank Wilczek: If it’s an idea about the physical world you can have logical coherence and you can have aesthetic congruence, but it reaches an entirely different level when it describes the actual world, real phenomena, at least to me.
David Gross: Yes, and you could be wrong.
Frank Wilczek: Could be wrong.
David Gross: Believe me! I have been wrong, very rarely.
Frank Wilczek: I’ve been wrong maybe more often, but some of my best ideas have proved, what I think my best ideas have proved not to be right or at least not right in the original form they were proposed.
David Gross: There were other issues at the very beginning. Our advance was made on trying to understand what kind of theory could explain the behaviour of quarks at very short distances. The discovery of asymptotic freedom made it immediately clear that you could do that and calculate and test those ideas, but then the converse that the force became strong at large distances and led to the confinement of quarks that was still … When we very tentatively said that the fact that the force grows strong at large distances could explain confinement was very tentative and we had at the time no analogues, no other examples of that and it was such a crazy … I used to have arguments with a very famous physicist at Princeton, Eugene Wigner, for years and years and each time he would say, Quarks can’t exist because you could never produce them. The idea that you could base a theory on objects that you could never see directly seemed to most people – and even to us – dangerous. It took a long time, well, a long time, a few years at least, until one could see how this happened in toy models and then actually discover that there were analogues of that, analogues that people knew very well, like the Meissner effect in superconductivity that said ok well, now it’s not such a strange phenomena, there are examples in ordinary materials. Once those theoretical concepts were clear, I felt a lot more comfortable with the theory.
Frank Wilczek: It was very nervous making to be proposing a theory all of whose ingredients were unobserved particles and none of whose ingredients were observed particles.";56;Research
Do you still remember this feeling, how it is to get this crazy idea?;David Gross: It was exhilarating and scary because as Frank says it was clear from the beginning that the stakes were big, this was a big thing. Many of our smart colleagues realised this immediately and many were immediately convinced. But because the stakes were so big and the chances of it being wrong – as often happens – where none zero it was a little giddy and scary. As I remarked in my lecture, we didn’t have time much to think about it because there was so much to do, it just opened up, we got start calculating and physicist theorists really like to calculate. That’s the fun part of our business when you can …;56;Creativity
But the idea itself it was so crazy, was it like a revelation or?;"Frank Wilczek: It was putting together several, it wasn’t just one idea, it was really putting together several ideas that were formulated in different areas and then also ideas. After the central calculation there was a lot of work in working out its consequences. I don’t know if you’ll agree but I think in many ways the most important idea was not to worry about certain problems, just to go ahead and do the things we could do and not to worry about this problem of confinement.
David Gross: One couldn’t help to worry.
Frank Wilczek: Yes, but we probably didn’t do anything about it!
David Gross: I started to think about it. No, I started to think about it but, and of course being optimists. I originally thought that well, it’ll take us maybe three to four or five years to solve the theory completely. We still haven’t of course, it’s still on-going, a very alive subject to have analytic total control over the theory at large distances where it’s hard. It’s an enormously exciting field that remains. it’s hardly dead. The fact that it got a Nobel Prize does not mean that it’s over by any means, inuclear physics, QCD is still very much alive and exciting.";56;Creativity
It is about the future of physics. What is your favourite there?;"David Gross: There’s so many.
David Gross: Those are all fascinating things but the things that I really want to know the answer to before I disappear, have to do with the next goal of fundamental physics which is unifying the forces and also understanding the … We can push back the history of the universe to almost its beginning where everything breaks down, even this enormously ambitious and exciting and promising approach based on strength, breaks down so far as well. Something very deep is missing but we have a lot of clues and a lot of very surprising clues and I will be very disappointed if those questions aren’t answered in my lifetime.";56;Motivation
Do you think that string theory is the right way to get so far back in time?;"David Gross: Yes.
Frank Wilczek: It may be an important direction, I don’t know even know what string theory is but they’re clearly something important. It’s not a well formulated theory in a sense of QCD, with algorithms and clear-cut predictions, there are clearly some important ideas there.
David Gross: QCD is a revolution in the making and so we’re somewhere in the beginning or the middle or who knows where? But as Frank said it’s not yet a well formed … We don’t know what string theory is, in fact we’ve discovered recently that … Frank was somewhat conservative in his middle ages, he’s always been somewhat more sceptical about string theory than I, but we’ve now got the situation where string theory can’t be killed because certain of its aspects is almost the same as the theories that make up the standard model. It’s so continuously part of the physics of the standard model that it can’t be wrong, it might and it might very well be insufficient and at a conceptual level I’ve no doubt that in its present formulation or where we have so far got in understanding what string theory is or should be, its missing some fundamental new concepts. But it’s really not as we’ve learnt much to our amazement, any different than the gauge theories that we use to explain all the fundamental forces that so far observed.";56;Research
What concepts do you have I mind?;David Gross: What is space and what is time.;56;Career Devleopment
What is space and what is time?;"David Gross: What is space and time?
Frank Wilczek: I mentioned in my lecture yesterday how much physics and several Nobel Prizes in theoretical physics have come out of reconciling special relatively with quantum mechanics. String theory is one aspect perhaps or one attempt to reconcile general relatively with quantum mechanics which poses at least equal problems.
David Gross: Personally I really think that we’re in a pre-revolutionary state and that the next revolution that will deal with the deeper meaning of space and time, quantum space and time which is what general relativity is, and string theory already suggests some, will be greater than that of quantum mechanics because a deterministic view of the world was, is sort of what you naturally think of although it’s not so clear from talking to ordinary people. But our macroscopic view of space and time is truly built into not only to the way we lay people think about the world, but the way we formulate physics. Physics after all is supposedly the science of taking the present and predicting the future. If time itself is just an approximate concept which works for large time how do we formulate the laws of physics? For me it’s the most interesting question.
And you hope to hear the answer.
David Gross: I have very little faith that I will be able to answer that myself, but some young person might and I hope to be around to hear about the answer, yes.";56;Motivation
So, we have to wait like another four years?;"Frank Wilczek: Yes, that may very well happen on a timescale of three or four years, so well within our productive lifetime, so that’s a really exciting prospect.
David Gross: That might allow us to indirectly write test theories like string theory.
Frank Wilczek: Sometimes the crucial clues come from domains where they’re not anticipated, that certainly happened for QCD. The crucial experiments were these …
David Gross: Absolutely.
Frank Wilczek: … SLAC [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory] experiments which were not highly anticipated by the large body of theoretical community.
David Gross: Almost no-one wanted them.
Frank Wilczek: They were these kind of funny, no-one wanted to do them or think about them!
David Gross: My favourite example is the year of Einstein, 1905, he wrote three papers one proving the existence of atoms to even Ernst Mach’s agreement after Einstein’s work on Brownian motion Mach denied the existence of atoms, agreed that they must exist. He didn’t actually observe atoms, they didn’t have scanning, tunnelling microscopes, he explained a phenomena that was discovered by a botanist 50 years before the motion of little grains by the random movement of atoms. What more indirect evidence for atoms could you imagine but it was sufficient to explain, to convince the most die-hard, positivist of all Ernst Mach.
Frank Wilczek: It was very quantitative and non-trivial, that’s what made it convincing.
David Gross: I still have faith that if we had enough understanding of the theory which Einstein did at that time, of atomic theory, that we could indirectly test a theory like string theory but the theory has to do better. Unless, we can’t always rely on experimentalists to give us the clues.";56;Research

Frank Wilczek: It’s a relief. An honest relief, we’ll sleep better in October now and feel better about ourselves.
David Gross: I used to say October is, to paraphrase T.S. Eliot, October is the cruellest month!";56;Impact of Nobel prize on you
And what would you say, Dr Abrikosov?;Alexei A. Abrikosov: My answer, for me the inspiration was always experiment. Some experimental facts which were strange, could not get an immediate explanation, and so on. These were always my source of inspiration, and I think that only that. Yes, I am very closely connected to experiment. Not mathematics, not models, nothing but experimental data. And so of course after that, what Tony said, the thinking and so on, even sleepless nights, that is of course how it comes. However …;57;Creativity
It’s a part of scientific research?;"Alexei A. Abrikosov: Yes. However, my ideas I just take from experiments.
Anthony J. Leggett: Yes, I would certainly agree with that. I always find that the main stimulus to theory is some curious experimental result that seems totally outrageous and unnatural. And one tries to understand it.";57;Creativity
But there is one problem in your fields of research in super conductivity, I would say, that you can’t predict the super conductors that would work in high temperatures, like room temperature. What do you think about that?;Alexei A. Abrikosov: You see, there was some experiment which was actually performed in the United States by an American physicist and a Russian visitor, which inspired these experiments where they tried to find high temperature super conductivity. They failed eventually. However, they inspired me to some extent, and therefore I even published some model, how high temperature super conductivity could be achieved. No such, actually, it was not achieved on that path but actually nobody tried to find it on that path, and so therefore I still have hopes that that is at least one of the good paths for searching high temperature super conductors.;57;Research
And Dr Leggett, what about prediction?;Anthony J. Leggett: Well, if you … there are about 100 elements known, if you consider a compound which involves six of these elements, then crudely speaking there are, let me think, a trillion such compounds. Nature has never made most of these compounds. We will certainly not be able to make most of these compounds in any reasonable time. Somewhere out there I would take a large bet that there are substances that will be super conducting at a room temperature. We just don’t know where they are in this immense space. Once we have a generally accepted theory of cuprate super conductivity, I think we may be in a much better position to go and look for them.;57;Mentor(Role Models)
Yes. So you have to find something entirely new. Do you agree with that?;"Alexei A. Abrikosov: But with some idea.
Anthony J. Leggett: Well, I think, yes, I agree with part of that, at least. I would tend to, without wanting to express myself about whether we at the moment have a satisfactory theory or not, I would tend to agree with the belief that within the cuprate family it’s not very likely we’ll get much higher transition temperatures. What I do believe, however, is that there may be ways of understanding the cuprates, which will lead us to other classes of materials which might be room temperatures in the conductors. So I’m also optimistic.";57;Creativity
So maybe, somehow you need the genius. I’d like to ask you what is it that makes some people do the discovery and others who work as hard as the discoverers don’t do that?;Anthony J. Leggett: A large element of luck. Somehow, I suppose the people who do make big discoveries are ones who somehow manage to free themselves from conventional ways of thinking and to see the subject from a new perspective. But how you quantify that I wouldn’t know.;57;Creativity
It’s also good luck if something doesn’t work as you expect, as I understand. What would you say about that?;Anthony J. Leggett: Well, yes. Again, some of the most stimulating experiments, to a theorist, are those which don’t come out as you confidently expected them to.;57;Creativity
You mean that the cat is both alive and dead?;Anthony J. Leggett: Well, it’s difficult to express the result in classical terms, but if you take the interpretation of quantum mechanics seriously and you apply the same interpretation at the level of the cat as you do at the level of the atom, then you do seem to reach the conclusion that it is not definitely in one state or the other until observed. And that, of course, is the famous quantum measurement paradox or Schrödinger‘s paradox. That’s a very different situation from what one normally gets in the sort of standard applications of super conductivity and super fluidity.;57;Research
I understand. But what about quantum mechanics? Isn’t it bizarre that you have those super positions somehow, or whatever you call it, but somehow it doesn’t follow the logics.;"Alexei A. Abrikosov: I must say, I am in a sense much simpler. The existence of liquid helium that is actually at low temperatures and that it doesn’t solidify at ambient pressure is a quantum phenomenon. That is. It is a paradox. Such an object should not exist according to classical laws. And so, already here it starts.
Anthony J. Leggett: Well, yes, I would agree. And I think that is one of number of cases one could quote in which one sees in one sense or other the macroscopic effects of quantum mechanics. But I’m including the difference between a liquid and a solid, as a macroscopic difference. But I do think there’s a big difference between this kind of case and the genuine Schrödinger’s cat kind of situation, which is one which we have not yet been really able to probe directly in experiments, although we’re working towards it.";57;Research
"There was a big problem even for, I would say, the most famous scientist in the world, Albert Einstein; he could never accept quantum mechanics, because it was too bizarre for him. Do you think it is real, somehow?";Anthony J. Leggett: I personally think it’s entirely possible that in the year 3000 we will still believe that quantum mechanics is the whole truth about the world. If we really do still believe it in the year 3000, then I think in some sense our attitude towards the physical world at the everyday level will be radically different from what it is today, because we will really have had to face up to this weirdness, which by that time I’m confident will have been amplified to the everyday level. I think it’s at least equally probable and perhaps more so, that as we go from the level of the atom to the level of the cat, we will find that somewhere along the line quantum mechanics breaks down and some new theory of which we can have at present no conception will take over. I am personally hopeful that it’s the second thing that happens.;57;Future Research
What about quantum computers?;"Alexei A. Abrikosov: What Tony was telling you, it was exactly about quantum computers.
Anthony J. Leggett: Well, if quantum mechanics does describe the whole universe at all levels, then it seems, as far as I can see, that there is no reason in principle why one should not build a functioning quantum computer. I think, however, one may well find that the practical difficulties of doing that are just so enormous that in the end people will conclude that it just isn’t worth it. That although the price tag on a quantum computer that can factorise, say, a 500 digit number, is very large, it’s not infinite, and at some point people may just conclude that it isn’t worth the effort.";57;Future Research
It will be too expensive, you mean?;Anthony J. Leggett: Yes. Well, or just take too long and involve too many people etc, etc, yes.;57;Future research
Do you have any other guesses?;Alexei A. Abrikosov: No, no. I don’t. Somehow, this topic, I never loved, and so therefore I always decide, I never go to conferences on quantum computing, and so on, so that’s not for me. That’s not for me.;57;Research
It’s the weird, or too far from experiment, or why?;"Alexei A. Abrikosov: Well, it’s far from experiment, and from my point of view, it’s dull. I don’t know, my taste is so, I like objects, you know, I can see and I can feel them.
Anthony J. Leggett: I would think it’s probably fair to say that at least right now the challenge of quantum computing is not throwing up any very deep new conceptual questions. It’s a matter of in some sense engineering, and so whether it’s a matter of taste, whether you regard that as interesting or not.";57;Creativity
So what is the challenge for the future, do you think, in your field?;"Alexei A. Abrikosov: In my field, first of all, if you speak like that, that we have many challenges, actually. And every time I am working on something and that is maybe a small problem from your point of view, but usually one should not divide the problems into small and large problems, because every small problem can become a large problem, or eventually, you know, develop into something. So therefore one must just, if one has a problem, one has to solve it. And that’s all. That is the main important thing. Of course, the general challenge is high temperature super conductivity, room temperature super conductivity, in my field at least, yes, but however, I understand very well that I am alone unable to solve it. Yes, and so it requires an effort of many people and for some time, yes, and experimental efforts, actually, not just theoretical attempts, yes? A theorist can give an idea where to search. However, he cannot predict that just this and this substance will be the one. No. No way.
And so just when I was in Washington, there was such a session that was dedicated to 50 years since Eisenhower gave a talk at the United Nations about peaceful applications of atomic energy. So then I said there, I spoke about it, room temperature super conductivity, and I said that in order to reach that goal, and it is reachable, I am absolutely sure about that, then the funding system for science for this particular thing must be changed entirely, because it is a long term project and you cannot expect immediate, immediate success and you cannot even predict when that success will happen. However, if you conceive that topic is solvable and so on, so then, you must just give money for that, and people will do research, yeah, and that’s all, yeah? And then Ray Orbach, who is the head of basic energy sciences in the Department of Energy, so he said: I heard what you said, and I will think about that. And so he definitely has some positive thoughts about that.";57;Future Research
Professor Ginzburg, welcome to the Nobel e-Museum. We are very happy to have you here. You have a very long career in science behind you, I would say, so my first question would be what is your most exciting memory of life in science?;Vitaly Ginzburg: It is difficult to answer because it is many exciting stories. A lot of things, especially I would like to stress how the life of anybody – I’m no exception – is something like a very small boat on the sea. I give here a lot of examples of how my boat can turn around. For instance, one example. During the war we … I am from 1940 working in the Lebedev Physical Institute of Science of USSR, it was Soviet Union and now Russia, so forty-three years I worked in the same institute. During the war we were in evacuation in Kazan. Kazan at that time was not on the river Volga but five or six kilometres from Volga, afterwards they made a dam and now Kazan … It is not important.;58;Life
Do you regret this, that you worked with the hydrogen bomb?;Vitaly Ginzburg: I do not regret because it is very amusing because … First, we understood nothing. We suppose, we don’t understand the Stalinist bandit and suppose that all the harsh thing is connected, not closely connected with the regime, even I. My wife was in exile at this moment, in prison before. And nevertheless I suppose that this bandit is not so bad that somebody else make his atrocities. The other question … and we don’t understood … [Only] now I understand that Stalin, if he have a bomb first he can destroy all mankind. I was admitted to work in this project in the beginning when it was an open problem. Possible to do. Then Sakharov and I proposed how to do. In 1950 Sakharov was sent to the so called Sarov, Arzamas-16, the place where the bomb was built. But I was, because I was not good enough, have not sent there. In fact after this I have absolutely no connection with this military. I never seen the bomb, never seen the explosion, never seen anything.;58;Motivation
You wrote, “We were prisoners of the system, but we were happy.” What did you mean?;Vitaly Ginzburg: Happy? This is strange. I wouldn’t say we were happy. The fact is that … Where you read this? The prisoner of system and happy. I don’t remember this. Of course, you see every person somehow adapt to the situation. We were happy. Many people were starving. Many people were wounded. Many people were killed. We were happy in the sense that we can do work which we like with the exception of this military work as I mentioned to you. Also, for my part I have absolutely nothing to do with armament etc, because I was not allowed to go to the real military centre. I also work at physics. Without this I have something to eat, I have very bad flat and not starving. It was possibly enough to be happy.;58;Creativity
Professor Alexei Abrikosov, and Tony Leggett, welcome to the Nobel e-Museum and also to this interview. We’re very happy to have you here. I’d like to ask you the first question. What are the sources of inspiration to you, as a scientist, Dr Leggett?;Anthony J. Leggett: I think that’s a rather difficult question to answer, actually. I think in the scientific discovery, luck plays an enormous role, but I think one thing one can be fairly sure about is that if you’ve not been thinking about the problem continuously and perhaps even when you’re lying awake at night for some time, perhaps some weeks or even some months, then it’s unlikely that you’ll get the sudden flash of discovery that makes it work.;59;Mentors (Role models)

Anthony J. Leggett: I would think it’s probably fair to say that at least right now the challenge of quantum computing is not throwing up any very deep new conceptual questions. It’s a matter of in some sense engineering, and so whether it’s a matter of taste, whether you regard that as interesting or not.";59;Creativity
I understand. So what is the challenge for the future, do you think, in your field?;"Alexei A. Abrikosov: In my field, first of all, if you speak like that, that we have many challenges, actually. And every time I am working on something and that is maybe a small problem from your point of view, but usually one should not divide the problems into small and large problems, because every small problem can become a large problem, or eventually, you know, develop into something. So therefore one must just, if one has a problem, one has to solve it. And that’s all. That is the main important thing. Of course, the general challenge is high temperature super conductivity, room temperature super conductivity, in my field at least, yes, but however, I understand very well that I am alone unable to solve it. Yes, and so it requires an effort of many people and for some time, yes, and experimental efforts, actually, not just theoretical attempts, yes? A theorist can give an idea where to search. However, he cannot predict that just this and this substance will be the one. No. No way.
And so just when I was in Washington, there was such a session that was dedicated to 50 years since Eisenhower gave a talk at the United Nations about peaceful applications of atomic energy. So then I said there, I spoke about it, room temperature super conductivity, and I said that in order to reach that goal, and it is reachable, I am absolutely sure about that, then the funding system for science for this particular thing must be changed entirely, because it is a long term project and you cannot expect immediate, immediate success and you cannot even predict when that success will happen. However, if you conceive that topic is solvable and so on, so then, you must just give money for that, and people will do research, yeah, and that’s all, yeah? And then Ray Orbach, who is the head of basic energy sciences in the Department of Energy, so he said: I heard what you said, and I will think about that. And so he definitely has some positive thoughts about that.";59;Future research
Dr Giacconi, Dr Koshiba, Dr Raymond Davis and Andrew Davis, welcome to Stockholm and to this Nobel interview. Yesterday you received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this year 2002. The Nobel Prize gives you fame and it gives you money too. Do you feel happy? Dr Davis?;Raymond Davis Jr: Same with me. My wife said, Why don’t we take all the children? and that will be the way we’ll spend our money.;60;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I would like to say that the three of you share also another experience, I would say, of many years of work and trying to get and interbreed the signals from space. What you also share is the experience of not getting things right, maybe also the experience of getting accidents. Did you ever think about just quitting the field? Dr Giacconi?;Riccardo Giacconi: Not at all. Can I expand a little on this? I used to be asked to give early morning breakfast talks to the donors and sponsors of the Hopkins University. I used to wake them in the morning asking them the question what does it mean if the Hubble telescope, upon being on the launch pad, blows up? What does it mean? My answer was that the point of it all was not this piece of metal and glass but what we were learning in doing it. Learning about our own field. Learning about being able to work together. At the end of this process, whether it blew up or not – of course much better if it didn’t – but this of course woke them up in the morning, this prospect. But basically we had changed and we had changed in such a way, we learn enormously, and it was easy to be the next one. Progress I think, we tend of overemphasise the stuff which is a result of the hard work, but there is a tremendous amount of learning that goes in doing this and in preparing for this and that will remain no matter what happens. No, I never doubted that I would go on.;60;Creativity
Do you mean that you learn even more if things go wrong?;"Riccardo Giacconi: Sometimes. It’s not obvious that the lessons are then properly implemented but yes, you do.
Andrew Davis: Sometimes not such a fun way to learn.
Riccardo Giacconi: But it’s good because it’s a reality check. In many activities in human life there is no reality check. One can claim he is the greatest. Here Nature is a kind and abundant mother, but it’s also a hard taskmaster – that is if you don’t do it right, it just won’t happen.";60;Creativity
Dr Davis, you were working for 30 years trying to measure neutrinos from the sun and never getting it right, I would say. How could you persist?;Raymond Davis Jr: First off, it’s funding in science. You have to get enough money to do it right. I found that not too hard to do because the funding agencies have been very good to the laboratory that I live in and that’s a very important factor.;60;Creativity
But you’ve also been heavily criticised, for example as a chemist by your colleagues physicists. How did you communicate?;Raymond Davis Jr: They’re the same. Most of my experiments are really using chemicals and physics and … The other thing, I did a lot of work underground, so I wanted to find someone to dig a hole for me. Quite deep. You go to a mine and talk to the management and they say yes, you can do that.;60;Creativity
You went to the gold mine in South Dakota?;Raymond Davis Jr: Yes. In looking for neutrinos the way I did, you really need that. The company has to help and dig a little for us.;60;Family/Home Environment
Have you ever visited your father in the mine?;Andrew Davis: Yes, I visited many years ago. Before I answer that I thought I would say a little bit more also about the experiment. You were saying do you have difficulty perhaps being wrong. In the end of course it was not wrong. The experiment was right and the solar model was right, it was the neutrinos which in some sense are misbehaving or at least not behaving in the way people had expected them to. In the early days of your experiment and the challenge of physicists and theoreticians to you to say there must be something wrong with this step, that made your experiment better because you did more tests. You never think of giving up at that stage. You continue to believe, know from your own knowledge that it’s correct, and you try to follow up on that and make the experiment better. Do more tests to convince other people that you’re right. That’s how it works. In my case I visited the mine in 1968 when I was 18 years old. The whole family drove across the country and we visited the mine on the way. I’m the oldest of five children. I was the only one over 18 at the time so I was the only one permitted in the mine. My mother was not permitted in the mine because at that time women were not permitted in the mine, it was considered to be unlucky. Of course today there are women miners working, so things have changed.;60;Creativity
I would like to continue a little about being a scientist. I would say that this is the thing, that you never quitted in spite of all the difficulties. This leads to the Nobel Prize somehow. Dr Giacconi, you mentioned before that one of your favourite lectures is the story of the white whale of Moby Dick. Is that a metaphor for science?;Riccardo Giacconi: I think that we do science because we must and we want to.;60;Motivation
What do you mean by must?;"Riccardo Giacconi: We can’t help it. We’re interested. We are lucky we hit upon a problem which really holds our own interest, and then we wish to carry out the work. One of the greatest difficulties is persuading somebody else which normally is required to give you funding, ‘somebody else’ means an agency, one or the other. For instance, in my case when I started off, I tried to convince the National Aeronautics Space Administration that I wanted to go and look at stars in x-rays and they thought this would not be interesting. Then I had to go to the Air Force and ask if they could be interested. They at the time were interested in studying the moon perhaps, so that’s why my proposal emphasised the moon because this was interesting for a sponsor. Basically, I was doing what I wanted to do. Then misfortune, criticism and so forth …
While you internalise a lot of this but basically you are doing what you want and that’s a fantastic reward, to be allowed to do in life what you want to do. It’s very difficult to reflect you, and adversity in a sense of what? Maybe one could give up, but it never occurred to me that I would. The adversity was just something that, particularly in space programme, you have to become accustomed to the fact that there may be failure. Do you stop? Not at all. You go on, you try to figure out a better way, you try to figure out some way to put in more disaster proof approaches and so on, but I haven’t heard anybody really involved that would quit. What makes people quit I think, is when they absolutely cannot convince their peers that what they want to do is rational. Therefore, they have great difficulties in getting support because of peer review system and so forth, particularly in the United States. Since we are sensitive people just like anybody else you tend to internalise that as a self-criticism. Maybe I don’t know what I’m doing, and at that point you’re lost.";60;Competencies
What about the story of Moby Dick?;Riccardo Giacconi: Moby Dick is only a funny story. When we launched the satellite there was a question of what should be the name and we had been very impressed with the name that the British gave to their own little satellite which was called Aerial. Aerial is nice because it gives you an idea of a live spirit, England. You don’t have to say more, you know it’s a British satellite. We were wondering what was the equivalent and some of my colleagues suggested Pequot. Now Pequot happens to be a Massachusetts Indian tribe. That was also the name of the ship of Captain Ahab and they saw some similarities between my behaviour and that captain Ahab.;60;Personal Characteristics
Chasing the white whale?;Riccardo Giacconi: Chasing a dream, notwithstanding the difficulties and Nature. The white whale is evil so you’re chasing evil. Then this name was vetoed because congress would have objected and the environmentalists about chasing whales and the congress, particularly of the United States, would have objected in chasing white whales which would have been a wasted enterprise. We never got called Pequot but I always have kept in my mind the Moby Dick story because it’s reliving the myth of Prometheus, it’s been picked up by Dante in Ulysses, in the Divine Comedy. Then I think Melville … That was just a retelling of the myth in puritanical New England. I found it interesting.;60;Dealing with difficulties
I have another question. You two especially, Dr Giacconi and Dr Koshiba, you are leaders of big experimental groups, there are several hundred people, or eve thousands maybe, working together. What is the input or the role of individual creativity in comparison with the work in science of the group?;Masatoshi Koshiba: You ask me a very difficult question. I don’t know how to explain it.;60;Creativity
How important is the individual in science?;Masatoshi Koshiba: Individual is very important. There’s no doubt about it. At the same time if you are carrying out a large experiment you do also need a good collaboration spirit. The only thing you can achieve or acquire this is that you get trusted by your colleagues. How? I don’t know. You just trust your colleagues and they trust you.;60;Competencies
Dr Giacconi, Dr Koshiba, Dr Raymond Davis and Andrew Davis, welcome to Stockholm and to this Nobel interview. Yesterday you received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this year 2002. The Nobel Prize gives you fame and it gives you money too. Do you feel happy? Dr Koshiba;Masatoshi Koshiba: I felt the same. I also bought my granddaughters. They were happy and I was happy too.;61;Impact of Nobel prize on you
Do you mean that you learn even more if things go wrong?;Masatoshi Koshiba: It is true that I did have difficulties from time to time in my experiment. I never give up. I think about it over and over again until I find some solution. This is the way I have been doing my work.;61;Creativity
You two especially, Dr Giacconi and Dr Koshiba, you are leaders of big experimental groups, there are several hundred people, or eve thousands maybe, working together. What is the input or the role of individual creativity in comparison with the work in science of the group?;Masatoshi Koshiba: You ask me a very difficult question.

How? I don’t know. You just trust your colleagues and they trust you.;61;Competencies
There is this spirit in science that science goes its own way somehow, that scientists can be replaced. Something is in the air. If I don’t do this maybe somebody else will do it. What do you say about that Dr Koshiba?;Masatoshi Koshiba: Science is a special type of recognition and by its nature it is a common asset of the entire human being. Therefore, if I didn’t build the detector and detect super nova neutrinos. Well, a super nova happens every 30 years in the average galaxy but in our own galaxy the previous one was more than 300 years ago. However eventually other people will think of detecting such neutrinos and then find it – there is no doubt about it. When it comes to different type of recognition, like when you are listening to the music you like, then you and the recognised subject there is no separation between the two. You and music are just one entity. You enjoy it, you don’t analyse it, you don’t study it. You just feel it, this is the type of recognition different from scientific recognition. For instance, I used to say if Mozart didn’t make this particular music there would be nobody who can produce the same thing.;61;Roles of Science
This is another way of putting the question of what you are doing as a scientist. Are you studying the nature as it is or are you just testing your morals?;"Masatoshi Koshiba: You’re my spokesman.
Riccardo Giacconi: He does that to me. He did that to me once before. Then he’s very tough on me when I don’t give the right answer. I know this trick. I have seen this trick.";61;Meaning of Work
Dr Giacconi, Dr Koshiba, Dr Raymond Davis and Andrew Davis, welcome to Stockholm and to this Nobel interview. Yesterday you received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this year 2002. The Nobel Prize gives you fame and it gives you money too. Do you feel happy? Dr Giacconi.;Riccardo Giacconi: All I can tell you is we had a wonderful time yesterday and at 7.30 in the morning I was woken up by the grandchildren before they had breakfast and then after they had breakfast because they were leaving. Having them here was perhaps one of the very happy things I could do for them and made me happy.;62;Impact of Nobel prize on you
The family makes you happy?;Riccardo Giacconi: Very much so.;62;Family/Home Environment
I would like to say that the three of you share also another experience, I would say, of many years of work and trying to get and interbreed the signals from space. What you also share is the experience of not getting things right, maybe also the experience of getting accidents. Did you ever think about just quitting the field?

Then I think Melville … That was just a retelling of the myth in puritanical New England. I found it interesting.;62;Dealing with difficulties
What would you say Dr Giacconi? You have also a big collective to lead.;"Riccardo Giacconi: We are after all working in the United States so some of the things I’m going to say are fairly common, at least in management experience in the United States. One thing is I think that when you are involved in big enterprises it becomes a little bit different than being in a faculty. If you ever been to a faculty meeting there are 30 people and each one has his own ideas, and we rarely agree on anything. Therefore, if you are asking for a recipe for action this is very tricky. You can’t get action. When you are involved in major programmes and particularly in space where there is a deadline the problem is not only to have creativity by individuals but have that combined with discipline. You can’t have discipline. Discipline in science doesn’t work. These are creative minds they can’t be told what to do. What I found works very well is we work like a band of brothers. Meaning that somebody is the recognised leader, but he is the leader because he has ideas and because he’s contributing leadership. If he doesn’t somebody else in the wolf pack will take over. It’s not quite as wolf type image that I suggest because for instance I can say with fair conscience that the Hubble space telescope institute, which was created from the ground, no major decision of any kind, technical or managerial was taken without reaching consensus. I don’t mean vote, I mean consensus. We would talk until we were blue in the face so that we could agree. However, once we had agreed on a technical approach or managerial approach then there was an implied pact that we would carry out this decision even if we had disagreed originally with all our might, in all our loyalty.
In order to do any of this you need to achieve a level of communication and truth. That is hard to achieve. I was very accustomed as a leader of this group of scientists being told I was stupid, and that was perfectly OK. In fact, the only real bad thing was if somebody thought so and didn’t tell me, because that would have been really dangerous to our progress. I was able to do that when I was young at American Science and Engineering where we did the discovery work and then the work on UHURU, at Harvard and then space telescope. Later on I became a little bit more imperious because I’m getting a little impatient, I didn’t have the time to go through all of this and building up this through a period of education. That’s the way to do it. I see no conflict between feeling fully contributing and allowed to create as an individual and to recognise that you need to work cooperatively. When that works those are moments in human life which are very rare. There is a great sense of privilege in belonging to such a group. The young generals of Alexander must have felt that way.";62;Creativity
Do you agree with that Dr Giacconi? That individual scientists don’t matter as much as individual artists.;"Riccardo Giacconi: We have had a running discussion with Professor Koshiba who obviously has thought about this longer perhaps than I have, but I do not. I do not agree to this, but I don’t have a very good way to express it, so I can only express it by stating some things. For example, let me think a moment of Kepler, the astronomer. Kepler had the following problem that he was thinking about the motion of the planets. He was very careful in interpreting Tycho Brahe data and he tried to express regular laws. However, there was a fundamental problem in his mind. He wasn’t obvious how the planets would be dragged in the sky according to these laws. What was the actual mechanism? There was an Italian scientist not quite as famous who had solved the problem by saying that the planets were inhabited by living beings who would fly like swarms flying around the sun in formation. Now Kepler didn’t accept that at all, thank God. However, he had no idea of gravitational laws. For him to say that there was a law of distance whereby the sun could influence the motion of the planet was like magic. It was worse magic than what he suggested which was that there would be magnetic brooms pushing the planets along in their orbit. At least it was a physical explanation.
Now the jump of going to that from that to recognising the physical laws that regulates this motion to me is a creative jump. The question that I really have been asking myself more since I’ve heard this concern of Professor Koshiba was the following. It is quite true that presumably we are living in one world and if we knew all about it, all aspects of it, then we would have to agree how it works. However, it’s not clear to me that for instance during the period in which you have no idea at all of probability, quantum theory, you really are conceiving the world in the same way as you would if you have a different theoretical outlook. Whether that would be part of reality that would remain hidden, or unimportant, or not interpreted to you. All I’m saying is very simple. Does language determine our thinking in a fundamental way because then certain different discoveries can be interpreted in a linear way? We are progressing one on top of the other but basically we are within a confined civilisation, a certain type of language. Is there some other aspect that we can never appreciate if we continue in that language? That’s why it would be interesting to find an alien civilisation. I’m sure that it would work in the same world. Would they really conceive of it in the same manner? I don’t know this. I want to think about it more, but it seems to me that maybe not.
Finally, one should say that I did feel as a creative scientist all my life and to be told that I’m not I don’t like it, psychologically, but he may still be right. But I was trying to put enough of a thought about it to say, well this example I’m using of the aliens is that obviously the aliens should ultimately come to the same conclusion. Now they could have had infra-red vision, they could have had x-ray vision or whatever. At that point would they come up with the same world view that we have? I don’t know. I can’t answer.";62;Creativity
Are you studying the nature as it is or are you just testing your morals?;"Masatoshi Koshiba: You’re my spokesman.
Riccardo Giacconi: He does that to me. He did that to me once before. Then he’s very tough on me when I don’t give the right answer. I know this trick. I have seen this trick.";62;Meaning of Work
Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle welcome to this Nobel interview. You have been in Stockholm now for a few days and yesterday you got the Nobel Prize and this was for your discovery of Bose-Einstein condensate – the coldest piece of material in the whole universe. Do you still remember the day of this discovery, Eric?;Eric Cornell: Very very clearly. It’s etched in my memory. The excitement of the people in the lab, the images coming up on our computerised camera. Very vividly.;63;Life
No secrets?;"Wolfgang Ketterle: Small secrets. It got the best out of us.
Eric Cornell: It really focuses the mind. It’s often emphasised as a negative aspect: Oh, we’re fighting together when we should be cooperating. But in fact in the long run there is cooperation. We publish ideas. We exchange. But momentarily when it’s focused on the idea of making something work I really think it does in fact provide a set of rules to the game that as Wolfgang says really bring out ones best.
Carl Wieman: I tend to think that it doesn’t make people particularly smarter but it does make you, just like competition in any other area, it makes people just try that extra harder. The students work with a little more effort and are little less likely to go off skiing.";63;Competencies
Blood, sweat and tears … This expression, can one apply it to research? Which of these is the most adequate?;Eric Cornell: Our chambers are different from Wolfgang’s. Our experiments are done in glass chambers and if one isn’t careful they break and in fact blood is not out of the question in these circumstances. The /- – -/ of materials these come naturally.;63;Advice  for young scientists
So it does exist at some level at least? (Bose-Einstein condensate);"Carl Wieman: For real atoms, yes.
Eric Cornell: At a great many laboratories, it’s one of the things that adds to the excitement of the field is that a lot of people have moved into exploring different directions. There are more than 30 laboratories all around the world, on four continents, that can make the Bose-Einstein condensation and there have been 5,000 papers published in this field.
Carl Wieman: An astronomical amount.
Eric Cornell: It’s all of these people thinking about it, bringing new angles to the problem. That adds to the turmoil.
Carl Wieman: And that adds to its significance in physics. If it was just us that had been working on this we would never have a Nobel Prize today.";63;Research
But when you see those equations and laws the physicists used to say that they also see the beauty in mathematics or the beauty of this coldest piece of matter. Can you see it too?;"Eric Cornell: Physicists like everyone else come in different philosophical strengths. There are people who take a more aesthetic approach to their work. People who take a more practical approach. People who take a more competitive approach. I think that oftentimes the physicists who have the most aesthetic take on things they’re very quotable. They talk about I see God of the stars and so on. I don’t say that I don’t see God in the stars but in fact I don’t think of my daily work as a search for God or even for something which is lovely. Instead I’m looking for something which is interesting. Something I can get my fingers on which somehow has broader implications.
Carl Wieman: I think we’re all looking for something that is new and different but that doesn’t mean it’s the grand picture.
Wolfgang Ketterle: I think I feel we show the beauty of nature and especially the experiments we have been involved in, they have been very beautiful and I think they have inspired other people.
Eric Cornell: I don’t disagree.
Wolfgang Ketterle: They have offered new glimpses into the quantum world in an almost emotional beautiful way. I think I agree with you that beauty is not a goal in itself but when we try to do the impactful important physics it means we don’t try to go for the little details, we try to go for some sort of bigger things, things which are really new and if we explain that well in an elegant way it shows the beauty.
Carl Wieman: I think Bose-Einstein condensation is something that does not exist in nature or certainly not with that. Nature is millions times too hot. It owes its existence to Einstein noticing these equations, had these strange properties, and then developing all these decades of learning to control things. How the atoms interact. And now these extraordinarily low temperatures could meet and now it’s formed, so now there’s this totally new form of matter whose existence only came because of physicists understanding nature and realising that it could exist and that making it exists. Somehow there is something grand about that, no matter how you figure it. This came out of simply human intellectual effort.
Eric Cornell: I think something which adds to that is that in turn through the efforts of human kind going through this extreme conditions, as Carl says, really beyond the conventional natural limits, we see this effect of quantum mechanics. The underlying equations which usually govern matter on the tiniest scale within the atom. We see quantum mechanics written large over the entire sample something the size you can almost touch. We see the laws of nature amplified in this way, very much by having gone beyond what lives in the natural world. It’s a strange paradox.";63;Environment
I have a final question: what kind of reward would you expect from the next years of your research, next years in science? What is the question that you would like to approach now?;"Eric Cornell: I’m sorry I didn’t understand the question.
Wolfgang Ketterle:  think what we are going to do next year is pretty much already on the drawing board because the experiments which are being planned and experiments which are in focus. That would also get us into some technicalities. What are the goals for next year? Of course there is more exploration of Bose-Einstein condensation.";63;Future Research
So you let people be driven by intuition?;"Eric Cornell: When you see it there, when you sense it, it’s exactly that, you have to let them go with it.
Carl Wieman: That’s the ideal to bring them to the level that they’re now taking off on their own and that’s when you stand back.
Wolfgang Ketterle: We’re not just doing research we are educating and guiding the next generation of scientists. And it’s just a wonderful feeling for me to observe how those young scientists become mature, become independent. I just want to motivate and encourage them to do that. It pays back. It pays back in their later life as a researcher, but it already pays back now because they are the people who make discoveries and drive the research.";63;Creativity
Wolfgang, you were working at another laboratory in parallel and also chasing the Bose-Einstein condensate. Do you remember when you got the news from Boulder?;Wolfgang Ketterle: I remember that day. I guess I was at MIT and probably Dan Kleppner was informed over the telephone and he shared it with us. We were quite impressed. It’s always nice as a scientist to see that science moves on. On the other hand, we were the tightest competitors and for several years we had put all our efforts, invested all our resources on the goal of achieving Bose-Einstein condensation. We were just about to get ready for the next round of experiments and I remember there was feverish activity in the lab because we knew we were ready to observe it. If you have worked for something for several years, if the final result is obtained within a few days or weeks this is almost simultaneously and we were running our experiments feverishly and we thought we would also have a shot at it.;64;Research
When did you arrive at the condensate?;Wolfgang Ketterle: We arrived at the condensate in a memorable night September 30th about four months later. In between it was a very traumatic time because for a few days or weeks we thought we had the experiment ready. We knew now of course that there would be a signal, it can be observed and we had everything ready to observe it, but somehow we had some problems, we couldn’t get the atoms cold enough. Then we tried in the following weeks to implement some improvements and unfortunately we lost the /- – -/ vacuum which is a major disaster and it takes weeks or a couple of months to get it back. We were ready to respond but we couldn’t. We had to wait for pumps to evacuate the chamber, to clean the surfaces, and it took a long time. Then we were ready to go and then in the next – I don’t remember – days or weeks of experimentation it happened on this night.;64;Life
This is why you’re sitting here, I understand. How important is competition for research?;Wolfgang Ketterle: It was absolutely crucial. I have to say this competition was for me a scientific competition at its best. There was cause for realisation. I learned from things you did. We were inspired and people were working harder.;64;Creativity
No secrets?;"Wolfgang Ketterle: Small secrets. It got the best out of us.
Eric Cornell: It really focuses the mind. It’s often emphasised as a negative aspect: Oh, we’re fighting together when we should be cooperating. But in fact in the long run there is cooperation. We publish ideas. We exchange. But momentarily when it’s focused on the idea of making something work I really think it does in fact provide a set of rules to the game that as Wolfgang says really bring out ones best.
Carl Wieman: I tend to think that it doesn’t make people particularly smarter but it does make you, just like competition in any other area, it makes people just try that extra harder. The students work with a little more effort and are little less likely to go off skiing.";64;Competencies
Why was it so important to get this Bose-Einstein condensate? Was this existing already in the minds of physicists and in science?;"Carl Wieman: But there’s a big difference between existing in the mind and being there. A nice dinner is very different whether you think about it or whether you can eat it.
Wolfgang Ketterle: Once you get to into the world then nature tells you what the properties are. There were some ideas how the Bose condensate would behave but some of those ideas were controversial. And if you can produce it and you can do real experiments then you learn something about nature. It’s important to do things to create things and not just speculate or have theories about it.
Carl Wieman: Another side of this is it didn’t have to exist. It existed for an ideal system. Whether it could exist with real atoms in a real world, that was a very much open question.";64;Life
This adds something to physics and physics adds something to other humans that are not physicists. How do you view the role of physics as a part of science in shaping our world view, answering the eternal questions of humans?;"Wolfgang Ketterle: There are definitely questions of humans that go beyond physics and they are treated in biology, in philosophy and in religion.
Eric Cornell: And in literature.
Wolfgang Ketterle: But what physics does it attempts to describe the world around us in terms of physical laws, particles, their interactions. What happens if you put many particles together and form different forms of matter? At this level of complexity, if you put many particles together things happen that you can’t really imagine by just knowing what the constituents are. There is enormous richness and new phenomena emerging if you put many particles together. This is the category in which the discoveries about Bose-Einstein condensates and the properties fit in.";64;Roles of Science
It wasn’t necessary – but you did. Einstein’s work for almost 100 years ago it has shaken the way people lood at the world and the universe around them. Do you think there are questions in physics, and answers of course, that can play the same role now?;"Carl Wieman: Absolutely. One of the big issues of the last few years is for example what’s the material in the universe. Physicists have now discovered and have quite convincing evidence that most of the matter in the universe isn’t the stuff we see, for example. That has to revolutionise our view of our existence. It means somewhere all around us most of what’s there is something entirely different than what we’re used to. That’s just one small example from the last few years.
Wolfgang Ketterle: Physics has not lost anything of its excitement. There are fundamental questions to be addressed and there are new questions being discovered.";64;Roles of Science
Which questions?;"Wolfgang Ketterle: The fundamental questions about particle physics. There are fundamental questions in cosmology. You just mentioned, Carl, that we don’t really know what is the major constituent of the universe.
Carl Wieman: But at the same time I think that physicists would like to maintain that they’re pursuing great questions. I don’t actually believe that. I think they’re mostly tinkering, like to manipulate control, tinker with things and that opens up – like with Bose condensation – opens up questions and then they say Yes, I really was, after answering this great question. A lot of the time it’s not exactly playing but it’s not pursuing great goals. It’s pursuing more modest questions.
Wolfgang Ketterle: But I assume this has always been like that and if scientists make discoveries which we now regard as very fundamental – when Max Planck explained the black body law – I think the general implication of those discoveries was not even imagined by the people who did it.
Carl Wieman: Sure. Both Einstein’s prediction of Bose-Einstein condensation was clearly that, he was playing with these things: Look at this. I’ve got these cohesions that describe matter, if I add this idea of Bose to that what happens. Oh this happens. It goes to a funny solution. I wonder what that means.";64;Future Research
But when you see those equations and laws the physicists used to say that they also see the beauty in mathematics or the beauty of this coldest piece of matter. Can you see it too?;"Eric Cornell: Physicists like everyone else come in different philosophical strengths. There are people who take a more aesthetic approach to their work. People who take a more practical approach. People who take a more competitive approach. I think that oftentimes the physicists who have the most aesthetic take on things they’re very quotable. They talk about I see God of the stars and so on. I don’t say that I don’t see God in the stars but in fact I don’t think of my daily work as a search for God or even for something which is lovely. Instead I’m looking for something which is interesting. Something I can get my fingers on which somehow has broader implications.
Carl Wieman: I think we’re all looking for something that is new and different but that doesn’t mean it’s the grand picture.
Wolfgang Ketterle: I think I feel we show the beauty of nature and especially the experiments we have been involved in, they have been very beautiful and I think they have inspired other people.
Eric Cornell: I don’t disagree.
Wolfgang Ketterle: They have offered new glimpses into the quantum world in an almost emotional beautiful way. I think I agree with you that beauty is not a goal in itself but when we try to do the impactful important physics it means we don’t try to go for the little details, we try to go for some sort of bigger things, things which are really new and if we explain that well in an elegant way it shows the beauty.
Carl Wieman: I think Bose-Einstein condensation is something that does not exist in nature or certainly not with that. Nature is millions times too hot. It owes its existence to Einstein noticing these equations, had these strange properties, and then developing all these decades of learning to control things. How the atoms interact. And now these extraordinarily low temperatures could meet and now it’s formed, so now there’s this totally new form of matter whose existence only came because of physicists understanding nature and realising that it could exist and that making it exists. Somehow there is something grand about that, no matter how you figure it. This came out of simply human intellectual effort.
Eric Cornell: I think something which adds to that is that in turn through the efforts of human kind going through this extreme conditions, as Carl says, really beyond the conventional natural limits, we see this effect of quantum mechanics. The underlying equations which usually govern matter on the tiniest scale within the atom. We see quantum mechanics written large over the entire sample something the size you can almost touch. We see the laws of nature amplified in this way, very much by having gone beyond what lives in the natural world. It’s a strange paradox.";64;Environment
In some way you see the link between the smallest things to the very large. The Nobel Prize is regarded as the highest award in the world of science. You are quite young people, you have a long future in front of you. How will you find the motivation to continue with your science?;"Carl Wieman: The first thing you have to realise is I don’t think any of us started in this with that goal. Our goal wasn’t winning the Nobel Prize. It was interesting science. The science hasn’t gone away just because you get the Nobel Prize. Maybe some of the time to work on it has. At least for me and I think it’s true, although Eric and Wolfgang can answer for themselves, but it really hasn’t changed anything about the motivation.
Wolfgang Ketterle: I have to say myself after the discovery of Bose-Einstein condensation in -95 and a year later we showed that condensates are coherent just one single wave. This was very traumatic. I had to say to myself that we may not be able to repeat that in my lifetime because it was a unique combination of there was something to be discovered, I was just ready with my team, I had an apparatus which could be used for that. Such breakthroughs in science are so unique or so that it would be presumptuous to assume that you could repeat that. What I expect for me is just to do good science, to do the very best science I could. I was quite happy with what we did in the last few years exploring the properties of a condensate. Things went very well. It wasn’t as dramatic as those discoveries but that’s what I want to continue. I’m not expecting for myself to do another major discovery of that kind because maybe I’m trying but I am not putting myself under pressure.";64;Impact of the Nobel on you
I have a final question: what kind of reward would you expect from the next years of your research, next years in science? What is the question that you would like to approach now?;"Eric Cornell: I’m sorry I didn’t understand the question.
Wolfgang Ketterle:  think what we are going to do next year is pretty much already on the drawing board because the experiments which are being planned and experiments which are in focus. That would also get us into some technicalities. What are the goals for next year? Of course there is more exploration of Bose-Einstein condensation.";64;Future Research
My last question would be what kind of science would you like to do now? What is the question that you would like to have answered in the coming years?;"Carl Wieman: As a purely personal view I have to say that I’m somewhat older than Wolfgang or Eric and have done several other things before Bose-Einstein condensation. I actually, although I still plan to keep working on Bose-Einstein condensation because I see lots of interesting experiments to do there, I see the next few years getting a lot more involved in something that I’ve been spending quite a bit of time on which is general science education. I have a feeling that the Nobel Prize will actually push me more in that direction and it will give me more opportunities.
Wolfgang Ketterle: I have a very active research group exploiting and exploring this new form of matter in different directions. We hope to discover new properties of the condensate or demonstrate that the condensate offers even more profound and deeper views into the quantum world. On the other hand we try to use the condensate to build very sensitive sensors. These are two directions which are both exciting and I’m hoping that we have new results in the next year.";64;Future Research
So you let people be driven by intuition?;"Eric Cornell: When you see it there, when you sense it, it’s exactly that, you have to let them go with it.
Carl Wieman: That’s the ideal to bring them to the level that they’re now taking off on their own and that’s when you stand back.
Wolfgang Ketterle: We’re not just doing research we are educating and guiding the next generation of scientists. And it’s just a wonderful feeling for me to observe how those young scientists become mature, become independent. I just want to motivate and encourage them to do that. It pays back. It pays back in their later life as a researcher, but it already pays back now because they are the people who make discoveries and drive the research.";64;Creativity
Can you describe the feeling of seeing this big thing?;Carl Wieman: The initial feeling was of course a lot of excitement trying to get this … But there was also considerable nervousness in it. What we saw looked so much like the best we had hoped for, it’s often the case you fooled you. When things work better than you almost can expect then oftentimes it means you’re fooling yourself. I remember forcing myself to say Wait a minute, don’t get too excited here. You could be just fooling yourselves. Let’s think hard about what extra tests we can do. How can we check this? We can’t get too wrapped up in until you are absolutely certain.;65;Creativity
No secrets?;"Wolfgang Ketterle: Small secrets. It got the best out of us.
Eric Cornell: It really focuses the mind. It’s often emphasised as a negative aspect: Oh, we’re fighting together when we should be cooperating. But in fact in the long run there is cooperation.

I understand when you arrived to the discovery that people were working through years because nobody was lucky enough to get it before you. I understand also that they had lots of failures behind them, so you must also have had it. How can you psychologically overcome all those failures you meet in your life as a scientist?;"Carl Wieman: I always think that one of the most important aspects for being a good scientist is the capacity to have a large threshold for frustration because it’s not just the big experiments that run for a couple of years and then fail. Sometimes the previous work you referred to, it’s been working … it’s polarised hydrogen, they were failures in that they didn’t achieve Bose-Einstein condensation, but they weren’t failures in that no results came out. They came out with results showing paths that don’t work and we learned a great deal from those experiments. That’s failure in one sense but success on another.
Eric Cornell: More success than failure, I would say.";65;Creativity

Was this existing already in the minds of physicists and in science?;"Carl Wieman: But there’s a big difference between existing in the mind and being there.

Zhores Alferov, Jack Kilby and Herbert Kroemer, welcome to the Nobel e-museum and to this conversation, and congratulations to the Nobel Prize in Physics that you received just three days ago. You have changed the world, the world will never be the same again, can we agree on that? Zhores?;"Zhores Alferov: No, I just was saying that the second half of our century was really the time when the information technology was developed so much, and /- – -/ just very, very frequently that we have now a post-industrial or informational society. It happened first of all due to one of the great discoveries just after the war, the discovery of the transistor, the invention of transistor. Then of course the discovery of laser-maser principles and of course the work of Jack Kilby, the invention of integrated circuits just absolutely changed the situation in computer science and information technology. I think that Herbert Kroemer and I just added to that the development of new kinds of materials, semi-conductor heterostructures which permit to control absolutely a new way that electron and light fluxes inside of crystals. This gives a lot of new possibilities for high-speed electronics and it was created real optoelectronics by development of heterostructural lasers ILD. But I also should like to mention the name of Nick Holonyak who did very strong contribution to conventional at first p-n junctions visible lasers and pn-junction LEDs.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes, he was the first, we had actually …
Zhores Alferov: Yes, he was the first who created the visible LED and the visible lasers.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes, he’s a good friend, a good friend of both of ours.
Zhores Alferov: Yes.";66;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I see, you two worked in parallel, you were in St Petersburg or Leningrad and you were in the US on the same problem?;"Zhores Alferov: Initially not knowing of each other. There is, we are working in parallel but it’s also there was some difference because Herbert Kroemer mostly was doing theoretical work and described some principles, makes the proposals. I did also proposal of the double heterostructure lasers and some other devices based on the heterostructures, but I am an experimentalist and first of all I started with the idea of the double heterostructure laser came to my mind, I first of all started to do that, to realise that. I was working at first just with technicians and engineers and the group would grow up, and we realised our ideas first of all, lasers and solar cells and heterostructure /- – -/ and other devices. But I should like to add to the comments of Herbert Kroemer, that It’s really he and I started with the proposals and consideration from the practical point of view, how to improve well known devices like transistor and then laser for instance, but what we did not expect it really, that from this heterostructure research just appear the new region of absolutely fundamental research which we call now low dimensional electro structures. It became possible only due to development of the heterostructures and successes in the technology of new heterostructures, so It’s always connected by this way, the basic fundamental results frequently came out from practical considerations, and vice versa.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes, but because they went beyond the original motivation, that where they created a new application ‒ this pendulum idea is a very good one. In a very real sense this has been true for science and technology for a very, very long time, that one creates the other, it’s a …
Jack Kilby: Although perhaps we are not very many solid-state physicists in the world, almost none before the invention of the transistor, a few thereafter. Today people working on integrated circuit problems are frequently solid-state physicists, so it has expanded the field and I suppose will continue to do so.
Herbert Kroemer: For example, if you look at the meetings of the American Physical Society, the annual meetings, the biggest single meeting is the March meeting which is, well, they now call it condensed matter physics but it’s really solid-state physics, dominated by solid state physics, so this is the biggest single area of activity for physicists as a profession.
Zhores Alferov: Right now if you look for instance for semi-conductor physic international conference which is going every two years, if you look to this conference for instance 20, 30 years ago there were just a few talks about heterostructures. If you look now, it’s practically 2/3 of the conference is the heterostructures and the devices and applications and so on.
Herbert Kroemer: It simply has become a universal ingredient in solid state technology, it’s a tool without which we could no longer do it.
Zhores Alferov: And then solid-state physics also.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes.
Jack Kilby: All the early work on transistors was done by people with very disparate backgrounds: chemists, physicists, electrical engineers. One of the best I knew had a degree in paper making, and all of these people were pulled into the activity and began to develop a common vocabulary and interest.
Zhores Alferov: I knew something about this very important discovery, transistor inventions in 1947, at Bell Telephone. I knew that from John Bardeen, who frequently visited the Ioffe Institute, and I met him the first time in 1960 at the Prague conference and also Nick Holonyak as a first pupil of John. He told me a lot, and what was very interesting in my opinion, that time it was a group created at the Bell Telephone in 1945, Bill Shockley, Walter Brattain, John Bardeen, Gerald Pearson, Gibney and a few technicians. Mervin Kelly, I think, was the vice president of the Bell Telephone, and he formulated as one of the tasks of this group just to check quantum theory for solid state, for condenser for solid state materials. I will be happy if now the vice president of the industrial companies, everywhere, in the United States, in Russia, would be so clever that put the task in an industrial laboratory to check some new principles in physics.
Herbert Kroemer: That was possible under Kelly at Bell Telephone Laboratories, I don’t think It’s possible anymore.";66;Creativity
But the institutes as the name of your institute says, is Physical Technical, this is a bridge between science and industry?;Zhores Alferov: Yes, because it’s a bridge between basic research and applications, and of course because I could mention Ioffe, when he founded our institute in 1918 during the civil war time, he was clever enough that physics in the 21stcentury is background for technology, so he from the beginning considered the physical technical institute it was the name of our institute and he was very clever person. He founded simultaneously physical mechanical department of the polytechnical institute. Maybe it was just another example, MIT and later Caltech, the universities where physicists educated with very good understanding in engineering problems and engineers educated with very good basic background in physics and mathematics. These physical technical universities we can call them Caltech, MIT, Physical Technical institute in Moscow is a university, in polytechnical institutes were the places where the new generation of engineers and physicists were trained.;66;Environment
What about your corporation? Was it mostly cooperation or competition?;"Herbert Kroemer: I think it was competition, right?
Zhores Alferov: Yes.
Herbert Kroemer: But friendly competition.
Zhores Alferov: It was absolutely friendly competition, and sometimes it was just /- – -/.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes.
Zhores Alferov: I think in general the example of the work in heterostructures, because we had very strong competitions with Bell Telephone Laboratories, with some other laboratories, but it was during the Cold War time, end of 1960s, beginning of 70s, but we invited each other to the laboratories, we organised joint seminars, so it was just an example, I think. The physicists in general gave the example how to live in this complicated world together and enticing the American and Russian physicists during the World War II, during the Cold War ‒ during the World War II we were just on the same front ‒ but during the Cold War also gives the example for friendly competition and to show that we are representatives of science and we are together.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes.
Jack Kilby: I think another important effect was that as the field matured, as work became more expensive, in the early days you could literally build transistors in your garage and all the equipment that was required to do so.

It happened first of all due to one of the great discoveries just after the war, the discovery of the transistor, the invention of transistor. Then of course the discovery of laser-maser principles and of course the work of Jack Kilby, the invention of integrated circuits just absolutely changed the situation in computer science and information technology. I think that Herbert Kroemer and I just added to that the development of new kinds of materials, semi-conductor heterostructures which permit to control absolutely a new way that electron and light fluxes inside of crystals. This gives a lot of new possibilities for high-speed electronics and it was created real optoelectronics by development of heterostructural lasers ILD. But I also should like to mention the name of Nick Holonyak who did very strong contribution to conventional at first p-n junctions visible lasers and pn-junction LEDs.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes, he was the first, we had actually …
Zhores Alferov: Yes, he was the first who created the visible LED and the visible lasers.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes, he’s a good friend, a good friend of both of ours.
Zhores Alferov: Yes.";67;Impact of Nobel prize on you
I would say that we find ourselves in an ever-accelerating circle of smaller and smaller electronics and bigger and bigger economy, and everybody feels like everything is going faster and faster. Do you see an end to all this? Herbert?;"Jack Kilby: Perhaps it is going faster but some of these things have taken quite a long time to materialise, the integrated circuit is 40 years old, Dr Kroemer and Alferov’s work is about that old, so when you’re sitting and waiting and watching it, no, it doesn’t seem quite so fast.
Herbert Kroemer: Of course you do not really anticipate what it will lead to, I think the development has not … You cannot predict what the applications will be. One of the reasons it took so long is because it took a while until the full significance of all of our work became clear. If it had become clear right at the beginning … Well, there was no way it could become clear right at the beginning, in fact I was not allowed to work on the double heterostructural laser because …";67;Advice for young scientists
If you look at the chip it is at least 40 years old or about 40 years old, so somehow the life expectancy for the chip, maybe It’s like 40 years or 50 ‒ that’s what I mean by coming to the end. What will be after this?;Herbert Kroemer: I certainly get asked this question very often and I frankly refuse to make predictions. One of the reasons I refuse to make predictions, is because I believe the progress in science and technology is an opportunistic one rather than a deterministic one- Particularly when you’re confronted with situations where the discoveries themselves create their own applications, until such time that we can predict the discoveries we cannot predict where it will go, where the applications will go and so I try to be a little bit modest about that one. But I am convinced that things will not come to a stop, I just do not know in which direction it will go.;67;Future research
Do you think that there is a scientific limit for development, for making electronics smaller?;"Herbert Kroemer: Ultimately, once you get below the size of the atom you’re in trouble.
Jack Kilby: The very factor I think is the decrease in cost. In 1958 Texas Instruments sold a single, not very good, silicone transistor for 10 dollars, today you can buy several hundred million much better transistors for that price. Nothing else has ever decreased in cost at that rate, so it’s tremendously opened up the field and permitted new applications.";67;Future Research
So it’s the applications and the economy which is the driving force behind the development maybe?;Herbert Kroemer: Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn’t, certainly, although I was lead to the heterostructure ideas by an applications question. Once the basic idea had emerged the order turned around, and suddenly there was a basic idea and you were now trying to apply this basic idea to things that were very different from when it got started. I became involved in the heterostructure concept by wanting to make transistors faster and that did in fact happen, but then I realised that the same principles that speed up the transistor could also be applied for light emitting devices and then the flow was from science to application. It’s like a pendulum, it goes back and forth from science to applications, science creates application, applications stimulate new science, and you cannot say it’s one way or the other.;67;Research
I see, you two worked in parallel, you were in St Petersburg or Leningrad and you were in the US on the same problem?;"Zhores Alferov: Initially not knowing of each other. There is, we are working in parallel but it’s also there was some difference because Herbert Kroemer mostly was doing theoretical work and described some principles, makes the proposals. I did also proposal of the double heterostructure lasers and some other devices based on the heterostructures, but I am an experimentalist and first of all I started with the idea of the double heterostructure laser came to my mind, I first of all started to do that, to realise that. I was working at first just with technicians and engineers and the group would grow up, and we realised our ideas first of all, lasers and solar cells and heterostructure /- – -/ and other devices. But I should like to add to the comments of Herbert Kroemer, that It’s really he and I started with the proposals and consideration from the practical point of view, how to improve well known devices like transistor and then laser for instance, but what we did not expect it really, that from this heterostructure research just appear the new region of absolutely fundamental research which we call now low dimensional electro structures. It became possible only due to development of the heterostructures and successes in the technology of new heterostructures, so It’s always connected by this way, the basic fundamental results frequently came out from practical considerations, and vice versa.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes, but because they went beyond the original motivation, that where they created a new application ‒ this pendulum idea is a very good one. In a very real sense this has been true for science and technology for a very, very long time, that one creates the other, it’s a …
Jack Kilby: Although perhaps we are not very many solid-state physicists in the world, almost none before the invention of the transistor, a few thereafter. Today people working on integrated circuit problems are frequently solid-state physicists, so it has expanded the field and I suppose will continue to do so.
Herbert Kroemer: For example, if you look at the meetings of the American Physical Society, the annual meetings, the biggest single meeting is the March meeting which is, well, they now call it condensed matter physics but it’s really solid-state physics, dominated by solid state physics, so this is the biggest single area of activity for physicists as a profession.
Zhores Alferov: Right now if you look for instance for semi-conductor physic international conference which is going every two years, if you look to this conference for instance 20, 30 years ago there were just a few talks about heterostructures. If you look now, it’s practically 2/3 of the conference is the heterostructures and the devices and applications and so on.
Herbert Kroemer: It simply has become a universal ingredient in solid state technology, it’s a tool without which we could no longer do it.
Zhores Alferov: And then solid-state physics also.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes.
Jack Kilby: All the early work on transistors was done by people with very disparate backgrounds: chemists, physicists, electrical engineers. One of the best I knew had a degree in paper making, and all of these people were pulled into the activity and began to develop a common vocabulary and interest.
Zhores Alferov: I knew something about this very important discovery, transistor inventions in 1947, at Bell Telephone. I knew that from John Bardeen, who frequently visited the Ioffe Institute, and I met him the first time in 1960 at the Prague conference and also Nick Holonyak as a first pupil of John. He told me a lot, and what was very interesting in my opinion, that time it was a group created at the Bell Telephone in 1945, Bill Shockley, Walter Brattain, John Bardeen, Gerald Pearson, Gibney and a few technicians. Mervin Kelly, I think, was the vice president of the Bell Telephone, and he formulated as one of the tasks of this group just to check quantum theory for solid state, for condenser for solid state materials. I will be happy if now the vice president of the industrial companies, everywhere, in the United States, in Russia, would be so clever that put the task in an industrial laboratory to check some new principles in physics.
Herbert Kroemer: That was possible under Kelly at Bell Telephone Laboratories, I don’t think It’s possible anymore.
No, so most of the research is going on in the academia so to say?
Herbert Kroemer: I would say in solids, in our field, the research with a capital R has moved from industry to the universities whereas when I came to the United States it was the other way around. I came to the United States in 1954, I then went back once but came again, and I went to an industry laboratory. There was very little going on at the universities …";67;Creativity
What about your corporation? Was it mostly cooperation or competition?;"Herbert Kroemer: I think it was competition, right?
Zhores Alferov: Yes.
Herbert Kroemer: But friendly competition.
Zhores Alferov: It was absolutely friendly competition, and sometimes it was just /- – -/.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes.
Zhores Alferov: I think in general the example of the work in heterostructures, because we had very strong competitions with Bell Telephone Laboratories, with some other laboratories, but it was during the Cold War time, end of 1960s, beginning of 70s, but we invited each other to the laboratories, we organised joint seminars, so it was just an example, I think. The physicists in general gave the example how to live in this complicated world together and enticing the American and Russian physicists during the World War II, during the Cold War ‒ during the World War II we were just on the same front ‒ but during the Cold War also gives the example for friendly competition and to show that we are representatives of science and we are together.
Herbert Kroemer: Yes.
Jack Kilby: I think another important effect was that as the field matured, as work became more expensive, in the early days you could literally build transistors in your garage and all the equipment that was required to do so. Today a modern semiconductor flat costs several billion dollars and it’s desirable for the industrial companies to share the development costs of those things.";67;Creativity

The thing that forced you to make your innovation as I understand was something called the “tyranny of numbers” can you explain that?;Jack Kilby: That phrase came about because people could visualise electronic equipment that would be useful if it could be built, but the existing technology made it too expensive, too bulky and too unreliable just due to the very large number of parts – the tyranny ‒ and it was a very apt phrase for the time.;68;Research
