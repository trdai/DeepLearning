    "What good advice have you received?",
    "What advice would you give to young researchers?",
    "What advice would you give to a student or young researcher?",
    "What advice would you give to a student interested in science?",
    "You turned 90 years old last year, what life advice would you give to a young person?",
    "Do you have any advice that you would give to a young researcher or young scientist just starting out in the field?",
    "What advice would you give to a young person starting in science?",
    "Is there a particular piece of advice that you would give to a young scientist?",
    "Do you have any advice for young scientists?",
    "What advice do you give to your students?",
    "What is your advice for young scientists?",
    "Do you have a favourite piece of advice for students?",
    "What advice would you give to a young person interested in science?",
    "Do you have a favourite piece of advice for young people?",
    "What’s your favourite piece of advice for students?",
    "What advice would you give yourself at 20 years old?",
    "Could you describe your Nobel Prize awarded work for young students?",
    "So unfortunately we are running short of time but I just wanted to ask before we stop; what do you say to young students coming in to the lab or to the telescope and saying: What should I be doing in the future? What are the good questions? What advice do you give?",
    "Theodor Hänsch, welcome. We’re here in Lindau, on Lake Constance, for the Lindau Nobel Meeting, which gives young researchers from around the world a chance to mix with Nobel Laureates, listen to them and speak to them. What do you hope that the young people here will take away from this meeting? What do you think they can learn from this?",
    "Just to round off, any advice to young students. Out in the nature and back in to the laboratory very quickly to do the research. What shall they do?",
    "Advice to young people who want to go into science today, or who are already studying maybe, and see that it’s difficult to find a possibility to do the basic research and has to be more worried about the future of having to maybe go into the industry and applied research, which is more common today. What is your advice? How could one think?",
    "Is there any specific advice that you could give to young scientists that might listen to this interview?",
    "What would your advice be to a young scientific student who would listen in to this interview eventually, on the internet?",
    "It was very special I think, so I think we should thank you very much. Is there something more you would like to say to young people around the world?",
    "What do you hope you can give your students?",
    "How do you want your students to see you as a teacher?",
    "Do you have any advice for young people entering science?",
    "Why should young people go into science?",
    "What advice would you give to the younger you?",
    "Do you encourage them as well to do that if they come and ask your advice?",
    "Is it so that you have to have patience as well. We talked about advice to young students, there have been examples of scientific discoveries that were almost seen as nonsense and then almost as an embarrassment, and then of course turned out to be major discoveries. Could that be an advice to young people that they need to have the courage of standing up for your fight?"

  "Creativity": [
    "How do you maintain your curiosity?",
    "Why is collaboration so important in science?",
    "When failure strikes, what do you do to move forward?",
    "What was the reaction people had to your theories?",
    "How do you cope with failure?",
    "Do you think it’s important to relax and have an outlet outside of work?",
    "Is that when your interest in the universe started?",
    "Did you have any accidents with your experiments at home or were they always quite straightforward?",
    "Where do you do your best thinking?",
    "Can you tell us about your relationship with your co-laureate Didier Queloz?",
    "What was it like to work with your co-laureate Michel Mayor?",
    "How relevant has persistence been to your career?",
    "How important is collaboration in science?",
    "How important is collaboration in science today?",
    "How important is collaboration?",
    "Did you ever doubt yourself; did you think that you must have made a mistake or must be wrong?",
    "You are awarded the prize this year for absolute first research that you did, coming into the field that you now work in. Can you tell me a bit about how that came about?",
    "What’s the toughest challenge you’ve faced? How did you overcome it?",
    "At what point did you realize your work was a breakthrough?",
    "What has been the most significant breakthrough in your career?",
    "You have described it before as the slowest ‘Aha’ moment in history perhaps, but you were coming to this realization that you were going to have a result that you were not expecting. How did you individually deal with it because the world welcomed it when it came out but as you were analyzing the data and beginning to see that this result … were you doubtful, were you thinking this is not what we should be seeing, there is something wrong?",
    "I think it gets busier as it goes on. I want to start by discussing the subject of play. People often view science as a very serious exploit but it’s really quite playful and you in particular keep play at the forefront of your research activities. Can you tell me how play figures in your research?",
    "Did people believe you then?",
    "Has there ever been a time in your life and/or work when you have doubted what you were doing to the point that you seriously considered abandoning said work?",
    "How do you find the questions or the problems to make your research about?",
    "Do you still remember this feeling, how it is to get this crazy idea?",
    "Dr Davis, you were working for 30 years trying to measure neutrinos from the sun and never getting it right, I would say. How could you persist?",
    "You two especially, Dr Giacconi and Dr Koshiba, you are leaders of big experimental groups, there are several hundred people, or eve thousands maybe, working together. What is the input or the role of individual creativity in comparison with the work in science of the group?",
    "What would you say Dr Giacconi? You have also a big collective to lead.",
    "I understand when you arrived to the discovery that people were working through years because nobody was lucky enough to get it before you. I understand also that they had lots of failures behind them, so you must also have had it. How can you psychologically overcome all those failures you meet in your life as a scientist?",
    "The last few decades has seen a very rapid development of electronic communication and electronic publishing. What does it mean for collaboration between scientists, do you think?",
    "On a daily basis, how do you keep the creativity going? How do you get that energy to encourage the students or is it just environment in itself that creates that?",
    "I can understand. How did you come up with the idea to become a scientist? Was it something that you wanted right from a small age, or was it something that happened during your student years?",
    "Maybe that’s one of, as you said, you know the reason you’re still so curious, is that what you need to have, the curiosity?",
    "On the subject of being able to do it, it seems unimaginably complex to make such a thing because you are talking about atoms almost in contact with other atoms, there must be no vibration. You are talking about a probe which is, as you say, one atom thick at its tip. The mind boggles. How did you have the confidence to even imagine that one could do such a thing, to make such an instrument?",
    "Is it important to work with young people, I mean, to keep one’s spirit, one’s creativity, do you enjoy that?",
    "Welcome to Stockholm, and to this Nobel interview, Professor Steven Weinberg. I have talked to some of your colleagues here, and everybody says that you’re the one to blame, or the one that brought light to the community of physicists when you wrote your book on cosmology in the early 1970s, called Gravitation and Cosmology. So how did you get interested in cosmology?",
    "I just would like you, Professor Penzias, to start off with your great discovery. It has been described as one of the biggest discoveries the last century. It has changed the way we look at the universe. It confirmed the big bang theory. When did you and how did you realise that you were on something so big?",
    "It seems that during your time at General Electric … You both had to feed a family and you were working very hard and you learnt a lot. Was there a change? You said you went into physics, did you then realise that science was your topic?",
    "You say your creativity is just as great now as it was, that’s your feeling. It has nothing to do with age but it has to do with curiosity?",
    "If we just turn the clock back a little bit and look backwards to what you have achieved, when you were about 28, 27 years old. Could you have imagined what you then found out, what use it would have at that time?",
    "You have found that one word that has got the fame, I would say, and also was named in another prize, and that is quark and quarks. What does that come from?",
    "What did your colleagues say about your idea?",
    "Eventually, if we go very quickly through your career, eventually you received the Nobel Prize in Physics. I know that this was for the invention of the bubble chamber. Could you say a little bit more about that? Could you say a little bit more about how one detected elementary particles before and how you came to the idea of the bubble chamber and how that was developed?",
    "How old were you when you were having these thoughts?",
    "What would you say to a student who has experienced a big failure?",
    "What role does hard work play in research?",
    "What advice do you give to your students about failure?",
    "Did you find people who supported your work? How did you do so?",
    "How important do you think bouncing ideas off your father was to you?",
    "You talked about translating hiccups into an opportunity. How do you deal with challenges?",
    "How important is it to be open to new ideas and unexpected findings?",
    "When swimming, you aren’t thinking about your research?",
    "Do you think science can be seen as a creative subject?",
    "How important are imagination and creativity?",
    "Was that an intuitive leap, I mean, when you first thought of this idea? Because coming from the outside, it seems as two quite disparate things. Was it intuitive to you that this was a mathematical model that could be used?",
    "Have you had a eureka moment?",
    "I suppose that one could make some complicated joke about the pace of the recession and all these lights and the astronomers, but we won’t go there. You are here because you made this remarkable discovery about 15 years ago, that the expansion of the universe is accelerating and up until that point people had thought that the expansion of the universe was either preceding at a steady rate or might be slowing down. And yet this remarkable discovery was welcomed by the committee, people didn’t say ”No, this can’t be” but rather they said ”Yes”. Why? Why did they accept it?",
    "So, with the isolation of graphene which was done in this beautifully simple way just with sticky tape on graphite we are told. Was that the end of a long series of attempts to isolate graphene where this was just the last thing that one might try?",
    "But the idea itself it was so crazy, was it like a revelation or?",
    "I have another question. You two especially, Dr Giacconi and Dr Koshiba, you are leaders of big experimental groups, there are several hundred people, or eve thousands maybe, working together. What is the input or the role of individual creativity in comparison with the work in science of the group?",
    "Do you agree with that Dr Giacconi? That individual scientists don’t matter as much as individual artists.",
    "The working together, the co-working between the three of you, the working together, how important is that do you think to really move on and be creative?",
    "What are you doing then if something doesn’t work?",
    "What would you regard as the most important observation or evidence for the big bang cosmology?",
    "I would like to ask you about lasers that you are the inventor of and also that you got your Nobel Prize in, masers and lasers, you got your Nobel Prize for, I would say that the whole generation of people today were not even born when you did this invention and discovery, but how did you start thinking about masers?",
    "No. That’s very interesting. Now, could I ask you also a question which we did not discuss before, but I mean you can say no if you want to? I mean you have worked in many places, I mean many laboratories, and also very different laboratories; some of the smaller, some of the bigger ones and so on. And you know there is a discussion about creative environments. Could you say something from your experience about …?",
    "How do you deal with failure?",
    "Do you think these hobbies make you a better scientist?",
    "What was the hardest part of getting people to pay attention to your work?",
    "I heard that you have a lot of blackboards around your house in case inspiration strikes. Are you always thinking and coming up with ideas?",
    "How do you deal with doubts in science?",
    "What makes the LIGO team so special?",
    "I know you have been diagnosed with MS some time ago. How did you, what did you do? And how did you sort of overcome, and handle something like that?",
    "Why did you need those shorter wavelengths? What was the need for the shorter wavelengths?",
    "Is creativity necessary to be a scientist?",
    "How do you maintain your own creativity?",
    "How difficult was it to lead such a big group of scientists?",
    "Can breakthroughs in physics still be done independently?",
    "And was it important for you to sort of look at the problem with sort of unconventional eyes, or…",
    "Can you tell us how you discovered you’d been awarded the Nobel Prize?",
    "Do you think it’s important to interest young people in science?",
    "Has working in films helped your own research?",
    "How do you cope with failure and with unexpected problems?",
    "Do you feel that the day has enough hours?",
    "How well do you know your fellow Chemistry Laureates?",
    "Has hill walking and exploring fed into your science?",
    "Do you think that is important, to get a lot of other influences?",
    "How do you stay creative?",
    "But you started out with the intention of becoming a medical doctor? And then you transitioned to research. I was going to ask you both, what sort of flipped you away from medicine onto the bench?",
    "And this is because this picture you had seemed to defy the possibilities that were allowed under crystallography in those days?",
    "Were you a childhood chemist?",
    "I want to pick up on this halfway point, because there is this marvellous abundance of molecules out in nature, that we look at and try to emulate and sometimes build and sometimes try to improve upon and then there are textbooks full of reaction schemes which allow one to think about how to put things together to make them. And you’re saying that we’re about, as an estimation, halfway towards the goal of filling those textbooks to the absolute limit. How does one estimate how many reactions there are to be discovered?",
    "What led you to surface chemistry in the first place? What was your path that ended up there?",
    "You yourself became interested in science at a very young age, do you think that that’s an essential attribute of a scientist to have become a scientist when they were still a child?",
    "Did you start to work together then? Or you knew each other before?",
    "How did you meet together?",
    "What would you say about this styles of doing science?",
    "What was it, maybe back in your childhood, that made you interested in science in specific?",
    "How did you start in this field?",
    "But do you recognise this way of making discoveries, that you have a problem and you are somehow waiting how to solve it? The solution comes just by random. Is this called serendipity?",
    "What were the obstacles?",
    "That’s what I wonder, how do you actually do a discovery? Is it a trial and error process? How do you come into the discovery?",
    "Professor Zewail, let me first congratulate you to this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry for your pioneering work on femtosecond spectroscopy. Would you like to tell how you got started in this interesting field that you have developed?",
    "How did you come to end up in science? Was there a family background in science? What started you?",
    "So then you went to university, was that in Wisconsin or?",
    "Professor Curl, I believe I read something about you, that you got your first chemistry box when you were quite a small child? Was that how it all started?",
    "Was it very hectic? You were busy all the time?",
    "But so how did your interest in science then begin? Was it at an early age at school already or did it come later?",
    "If you look back to your childhood, I just want to end way back. What was it in your life that made you want to become a scientist?",
    "The question is, of course, when you were out driving the car and you realised that you’d cracked it, you know that was it, you know you’d got it, I mean, what was it that made it and what was it that led you to that?",
    "After McGill, what happened next?",
    "How did you become interested in science by the way?",
    "But you must have thought of the risk of being ridiculed when you came out on the stage, in the open air, with all those results. Were you, by the way?",
    "So it could have thrown people on the wrong track for a while?",
    "Were there times when you were a student or back when you were working where there were failures in your work and you maybe felt despair and you had to have a role model? How did you then go about it when there were times which were difficult maybe in your work?",
    "When did you start?",
    "Indeed. On being a nice person, it’s not the image of the single scientist working alone, isn’t it at all? It’s community?",
    "Why was it so interesting to get this structure?",
    "You mentioned this is also a voice of a poet, maybe we can listen to one of your poems?",
    "But you switched your fields after the first prize?",
    "So you were working really on fundamental questions about life and where life comes from.",
    "Do you ever get imposter syndrome?",
    "Do you have any other examples of failures?",
    "How important has collaboration been to your success?",
    "You often also speak about your team and I know that after the award, you hugged every single person in your team. How important is collaboration and teamwork?",
    "One of the joys of your announcement was seeing you celebrate with your research team. How did it feel to be able to share it with them?",
    "What is your relationship with your lab colleagues?",
    "Do you enjoy reading?",
    "Do you find that science and your art are related in any way?",
    "What was the moment when you decided to pursue science?",
    "But you never gave up?",
    "Maybe you are still moonlighting, maybe we should not talk about this … How about you, Bob, you had wanted to be a doctor?",
    "We’ll come back to quasicrystals in a minute, but I just wanted to make a brief digression into becoming an expert because how did you become an expert yourself, how did you become a material scientist?",
    "It’s a nice way to be made immortal to have a reaction named after you, I think. If we turn to the cross-coupling reaction we’ve just being discussing. It began with you, Professor Heck, in working at Hercules company, I think, and you were exploring palladium’s ability to do interesting things. You weren’t actually looking for a cross-coupling reaction?",
    "What are the challenges, the difficulties in the instrumentation that one faces?",
    "Do you envisage them as solid or fluid?",
    "So this is what you do at conferences?",
    "How do you survive as a scientist when nobody believes you somehow?",
    "But what does intuition mean in that, that you look at the right things?",
    "Then you went on to PhD studies?",
    "So your basic degree was in chemistry and then you specialised in spectroscopy after that?",
    "Then I understand that you did not immediately start to work in science, you were educated as an engineer from the beginning and also worked as an engineer as I understand it?",
    "How on Earth did you feel and what did you think about when you sat there in the lab and saw all these results coming out that could only be explained in mechanism that no-one would believe in?",
    "And you trusted your structure determination above any of the previous evidence yes?",
    "Can you remember a specific time when you faced some difficulties and it was just sheer hard work?",
    "Philosophy of science or philosophy?",
    "That was the backdrop to you somehow developing an interest in science as a child. Where did that come from?",
    "Do you think there is such a relation between truth, beauty and simplicity?",
    "Does reading make you a better scientist?",
    "How important is teamwork in science?",
    "Does openness and collaboration aid science?",
    "Do you think music has been important to your scientific career as well?",
    "Can you tell us a little bit about your childhood? Were you always interested in science?",
    "Is it important to have hobbies outside your research?",
    "What are the characteristics of a very good team?",
    "Has collaboration been important to you?",
    "When do you get your most creative ideas?",
    "When was your scientific interest first sparked?",
    "Are you creative also on your time off from science?",
    "If we just return to the lab. You came into the lab and were involved in other stages of this β–adrenergic purification and cloning experiment where the structure of the β–adrenergic receptor was revealed. That acted in a phrase that seems very appropriate, as the Rosetta stone unleashing lots of other G-protein coupled receptor structures and revealing that there was this super family. I have often heard people say that in retrospect of course there was a super family, it was obvious, but was it obvious as you went into it?",
    "What was the project that you were actually doing, because you weren’t looking for quasicrystals, you were making these alloys. What were you off looking for?",
    "One of the things that you’re known for is that you re-visit problems, when a new technology becomes available, you go back to an old problem that you studied previously and you’ll study it again using the new technology. Is the Haber Bosch process one of those that you have looked at more than once?",
    "We hear constantly though that chemistry as a discipline is rather under fire, and that people are not going into chemistry in the way they used to, so do you think it matters how one labels the research? For instance you work in a department of structural biology, is it important the label which one gives to the research one does?",
    "How did you become involved in science if you go back?",
    "So what was the idea?",
    "Do you think that this is a problem of science, that it’s so reductionistic, that you see only the small details, the atoms and molecules, or as you say even big molecules, but these are very, very tiny parts of the whole? How can you get this whole picture then?",
    "Also you started working on quantum chemical methods and development on computational techniques?",
    "Microwave spectroscopy became your speciality at some point?",
    "So this is when your interest in atmospheric chemistry rised in this environment of meteorology or did it come later?",
    "So small groups, a lot of money and people coming from all different sort of disciplines, putting them together in one place and make them talk, that is the recipe?",
    "It’s the same problem on a different scale?",
    "Do you find science is an inspiration for your writing? In science and in poetry?",
    "When did you decide science was the path for you?",
    "When did you first become interested in science?",
    "How important is criticism in research?",
    "What is your relationship with Akira Yoshino?",
    "What have you learnt from doing sports?",
    "Do you see any similarities between archaeology and science?",
    "How do you deal with challenges?",
    "At Duke, you pursued this difficult task of purifying the β-adrenergic receptor, it took 15 years to purify and clone, that is quite an undertaking. Did you have, as you were on that path, the goal of that purification so that you were always looking that far ahead?",
    "Do you think it’s unusual that you re-visit problems?",
    "Shifting track a little bit, one of the things that you’ve described as giving you greatest pleasure is to imagine the molecular machine that you study, and when we spoke in October just after you’d heard the news that you’d been awarded the prize you began to describe how you see it, could I get you to elaborate a little on how you picture this machine working when you see it in your mind’s eye?",
    "And they are started by academics?",
    "Was it also a topic, an issue that you were interested in?",
    "You do nothing? Who is the worker?",
    "What does it mean, understand? Can we tell what is life?",
    "But there is a very exciting mechanism that I want to know something about inside now. I mean, how do you really break down a paradigm? Because that was what you did. I mean, how do you function as a scientist to be able to do that in the first place?",
    "So the problem with providing structures as a kind of service industry in the same way as you might provide DNA sequencing or something is that once you have the structure that isn’t really it. You need to understand more about the derivation and, so it has to be a collaboration, it can’t be a provision? And these structural biologists gathered in the ballroom in an Austrian village which is a beautifully European conception, they were crystallographers pure and simple?",
    "The poetry writing, does this make you a better scientist do you think?",
    "Is keeping up to date with scientific literature essential?",
    "Have you faced any barriers in your career as a scientist?",
    "Has music played an important role in your life?",
    "What discovery do you wish that you had done?",
    "Has doing sports been important for you?",
    "Those didn’t exist when you were doing these experiments and therefore that wasn’t a potential problem?",
    "Do you remember the moment, or the environment where you actually got the idea that led to this discovery?",
    "Was it very, has it been very hard work for you in a laboratory?",
    "How have you maintained your focus despite all the obstacles you have faced?",
    "That’s a problem when you tell a lot of jokes! Do you also cope well with failure and mistakes?",
    "What keeps you going, when you encounter problems or failure?",
    "How do you deal with failures?",
    "How did you stay focused on your research for all these years?",
    "I’m interested in this idea of being able to explain the work to any audience. I think Ernest Rutherford said that you shouldn’t be doing science if you couldn’t explain it to your tobacconist, which is a kind of antiquated concept nowadays perhaps, especially in the US. Your field doesn’t lend itself immediately to simple explanations, there’s a lot of jargon associated with it, so the fact that you feel that you can, with few alterations, explain it simply is a very encouraging message.",

    "You get very excited when you talk about this. Is excitement and curiosity the main driving force, why you have done all this?",
    "Another thing I think you stressed in some of your writings was the need for competition, the importance of competition.",
    "Has there been any difficulties, I mean, there were controversies even when you got the prize, in the protein only had part of this work challenged for many respects and as you come up with some even more definite proof that is the protein only theory will hold?",
    "What focused you on immunology? You quite quickly found that was your path.",
    "Illustrates how important it is to give opportunities to people at that stage in their development. A science camp type thing.",
    "So what ‘the hell’ led to your first exposure to second messengers and a career. / Many things, yes, so I was going to ask, what made you come and stay? / It comes again to that word you use, focus. It’s finding people who can maintain their focus despite all this stuff going on around them and presumably those individuals shine out, it’s easy to spot?",
    "I understand. So what was the problem that you were working on that was known since 1905?",
    "But in a way you were very blessed to have such an unswerving determination to follow that path. / That’s amazing on so many levels. It’s amazing that you two had the maturity to adopt this approach at such a young age, it’s amazing that the university had the confidence in you. Was this driven by Don Seldin?",
    "I have one last question about something else. You have left the research now and you have recently focussed your interest on other issues than doing research I would say. What engaged you most by now?",
    "You made a point in one of the sessions at this meeting that once you study microbial genomes and there is a project called the minimal genome project which tries to define what’s the minimum number of genes. Wouldn’t such a system be the most suitable in finding out the function of various genes, because the human with this much larger genome and many genes is incredibly more complex?",
    "What happened after Jackson Laboratory, the summer experience?",
    "Tell us about your co-laureate Drew Weissman and your collaboration.",
    "Tell us about your co-laureate Katalin Karikó and your collaboration.",
    "How are competition and collaboration related?",
    "Besides having more Twitter followers, has your life changed in any other ways since you became a laureate. Have you noticed anything that has changed since that happened?",
    "So a lot of the enjoyment is collaborations and interactions with other people?",
    "How would you describe your collaboration with Michael Rosbash?",
    "Do you remember first meeting Jeffrey Hall? &How did you and Jeffrey Hall complement one another?",
    "Do you have a good relationship with your students?",
    "Ahead of time … Then you two met at this Gordon conference in 1980 and it’s sort of the way science is supposed to happen, two people meet each other, have an idea, do an experiment and prove something wonderful. / It was after the talk the two of you teamed up? /We will turn to the experiment in a minute, but I just want to ask you in general about choosing companions in science, because it is so important to get the right people to work with. Is there some, and of course one works with lots of different people throughout one’s career, but are there some criteria that you applied choosing companions to work out with?",
    "Tell me about the beginning of Mike Brown and Joe Goldstein’s relationship, because you were there at the start. / Tell me about the beginning of Mike Brown and Joe Goldstein’s relationship, because you were there at the start.",
    "And your second post-doc was in Canberra where you found yourself at the Australian National University. And working with Peter Doherty you had very rapid results and came up with MHC restriction as an idea within a year of joining together.",
    "It’s a true collaboration between you and your students, then, you really working. / On the top of collaboration, your work with Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard was obviously a wonderful sort of symbiotic relationship. What was it that the two of you brought to this? Are you just extremely similar or did you have differing skills? / There’s a parallel there with Brown and Goldstein, another great collaborative pair, who also say that each other’s approval was what they sought, in a way.",
    "Then Yale and then you made what on reflection was the fairly momentous decision to go and do the MD Ph.D. programme at Case Western with Earl Sutherland, but you refused the first time. / And what was the question that they were asking at Case Western that really got you going? Were you even at that stage interested in the big questions such as how do hormones work? / And Joe and you had been post-docs together. /  Certainly so and they seem to have an unerring accuracy for recruiting future Nobel Laureates to their faculty.",
    "Yes, and this was genetics that you were in? You were two that got the prize, Richard Roberts.",
    "Did you support each other during those years of working very hard, when somebody felt a little bit despair or down the other one could support the other person?",
    "It’s very interesting to hear because I’ve learned from you that you had regular visits, I think, by Medawar early and then you were long standing collaboration with Hitchings and Elion. My question is did you have to stimulate our colleagues, our immunology colleagues to come or was it obvious, did you have to recruit them so to say?",
    "I want to explore that relationship in greater detail later. / Yes, I imagine a very rare characteristic to find. / Was the fact that you were here instrumental in the fact that he came back? Had you already made a pact? / Should annoy them as well, I imagine.  / Forgive me for dwelling on it, but it’s such a rare thing to find such a productive and long-lived collaboration. How does it work in practice, you share the same office space pretty much, your labs are completely inter-changeable if you like or inter-twined and your students come to one or the other or both? / Are you aware of anybody who has actually modelled themselves on you? / I realise that you don’t want to apportion credit individually, but can you identify at least what it is that is complimentary, what each of you brings to this relationship? / Incidentally that was Paul Janssen’s way of working, he founded Janssen Pharmaceutical, he walked round the lab every day and said what’s new to everybody.",
    "You got also in contact with Salvador Luria at an early stage. / At the same time without your knowing I guess, Howard Temin was having exactly the same problem in Wisconsin and you published the papers back to back. How did you get to know about each other?",

    "You have all been part of a dramatic shift in paradigm when it comes to looking at the brain because all electrophysiology before and when you entered this stage you changed the picture totally into biochemistry. Arvid Carlsson, why did you choose to go contrary and against everyone else? / Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard, what makes someone want to go towards the conventional wisdom of the time? / Eric Kandel, you started off as being a psychoanalyst interested in psychoanalysis and everyone thought that was the gateway to the brain at that time. How come that you didn’t believe it?",
    "It’s interesting, you mention science and culture together. We just got a new minister in Sweden, in science and culture, the same minister and the same department, Science and Culture, and when he gave a press conference just when he entered his chair, he didn’t get a single question on science from the journalists, just about culture.",
    "So is that the link between science and art for you or culture?",
    "Do you see any connection between the music and science because you had this connection. The previous person I interviewed here had the same, Manfred Eigen, and my mentor Hugo Theorell had the same. Do you see any reason for this? / That’s very good. This matter with sociology on science, did the Nobel Prize change your life? Did you come into lots of committees, you’ve got other commitments? / But in some cases perhaps it may be different, in different fields. How much do you rate … I mean first there is experience, science has long tradition and lots of previous results and then you work hard and you have lots of collaborators but you also need that push, the creative environment and the creative realisation of yourself. How do you think first, what did you consider about that in your case and how can we promote it in general?",

    "Have you ever had an eureka moment?",
    "Another fascinating information that comes from your science is how the olfactory system is translating scattered molecules of sense into an organised map in the brain, it turns into a physical map, Richard Axel, but who is watching the map inside your brain? How do you make sense out of a physical map from these molecules? / Who is watching? /But do you really think …",
    "But is the driving force here your curiosity about the phenomena behind the science behind it, the phenomena behind it, or is the welfare of the patient?",
    "So the benefit so far has mainly been to increase our knowledge but the benefit in terms of applications to treat the diseases will come later on?",
    "What does it actually mean for example to the general public? There has been a lot of talks about gene testing and by doing that we could prevent people from getting sick and so on, but it seems like that is not actually applicable?",
    "If we look at the biomedical benefits of the DNA sequence of the human genome, I’m sure when Jim Watson went to congress, he had many ideas on what the benefits would be and tried to convince the congress and I noticed also that Bill Clinton mentioned cancer, the cure of cancer would be something that would be following after the sequencing. How do you see the immediate consequences in the biomedical field of our knowledge of the human genome sequence? / Will it be possible to sequence a genome of individuals in the short time, in such a short time that it would be important in medical practice, in designing the therapy one is planning for a certain disease?",
    "Your discovery certainly have made it more easy to find out about how the system works and how the diseases are part of this. What makes you most proud of your discovery if you look back at what you have achieved?",
    "Why do you think so? Don’t you think that the development of drugs, there is commercial interests in it … / But don’t you think that most of the discoveries are kind of a surprise even for the discoverer?",
    "How important in freedom in science?",
    "What drove you from competition to collaboration in your field?",
    "Share your thoughts on competition and collaboration in science.",
    "In your banquet speech at the Nobel ceremony you talked about the combination of Peter the mystic and Rolf the collector. It was obviously a great combination of talents and complementarity, what was special about that relationship?",
    "You know the engineer says what’s that squiggly stuff and the doctor says that’s DNA. / In your mind that’s one key to the systems biology problem that people have to get away from only thinking about the system that they all study, which may be for instance a very small scale. / Given that question, you then as you say, need to get people together in the same institute, they need to work in close proximity.",
    "Why is that and what benefit has it given you? / Is it important to share your findings with other scientists and with students?",
    "Your own career shows the importance very clearly in terms of the collaboration between clinical research and pre-clinical research and the fact that we can work together. I know that you have been a prophet for that ever since. I think a problem that exists in many medical universities and medical schools is to get enough collaboration between the pre-clinical scientists and the clinical scientists.",
    "That’s just a toe in the water, but often the award of a Nobel Prize can at least knock people for six for a while but you seemed not to have suffered from that. Do you think the fact that you were together allowed you in some ways to share the load that comes?",
    "And you need to share information with other scientists as well.",
    "Yes, and you had also many contacts with the American scientists?",
    "How have you managed to cultivate your curiosity?",
    "How have you maintained your curiosity?",
    "What sparked your curiosity about our daily biological clocks?",
    "But does that mean that science actually really is coming closer and closer to reality? There are some truths that remain truths even throughout the centuries.",
    "Excuse me for interrupting, but I got so curious, but this is true that you have all entered a new way of looking at things that were contrary to the conventional views of the time. And still the question I am really curious about is how is your mental set up to want to go against this?",
    "How do you see Twitter and social media and the responsibilities that we have on social media?",
    "But your delight when you showed this to the audience, and you also came back to it in your thanks speech at the dinner. Is it very important for you, this?",
    "Because this central idea when we were talking about communication is that we talk about public understanding of science but as you phrase it now, that is not very easy to do, so maybe you should turn the thing around, it’s science understanding a public that is more interesting. / Yes, but also to understand how the public thinks and feels and what their values are, to be able to phrase their science in a framework where people can understand it.",
    "I guess the standalone medical school faces certain challenges of not having the surrounding media for research, but that’s also a problem that has been addressed.",
    "How did you manage to convince your company to keep going then?",
    "Have you ever doubted yourself?",
    "How do you stay focused when people question your research?",
    "It is fascinating, is it interesting because one tends to tell the story of science in retrospect as being a problem followed by a solution and its not quite that, is it? Its much more complicated.",
    "Again, something we’ll come to in a little while. This year’s prize has been awarded for work on two viruses, human papilloma virus, HPV, and human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, and the work on these two viruses indicates two very different timelines of research for discovery. in HPVs case it took you, Professor zur Hausen, a full decade to convince the community that your hunch that HPV was responsible for most cervical cancers was correct. How did it feel to have a hunch that you had to keep for ten years while working on it? / Certainly, yes, that unites the discoveries. But just getting back to this timeline thing, were there times during your ten-year search for the proof that you thought of abandoning the project? / Was it possible to convince the funding agencies as well?",
    "When the idea came up of using magnetic resonance, what did the physicist say about your idea?",
    "Were you able to have any influence over the way that Abbott [Laboratories], as a whole, did its research? / You did find yourself in industry for a few years and then you returned to Houston, to the lab. Did the sojourning industry change your approach to the way you ran your lab, did experiments?",
    "It took you 10 years to come to this conclusion, to really put forward the proofs for your idea. What kept you going when everyone was suspicious about the ideas? / But despite that all the colleagues, well not all but the scientific community around you, really thought you were doing mad things?",
    "You say that the pressure to deliver is a problem in the industry. Why do you think that that pressure to produce is …? / But the pressure to deliver could have a positive effect on the people who are actually doing it?",
    "On this idea of being fortunate enough to choose a hard question that’s intriguing, there’s a talent involved in finding the entry point, in finding something. That allows you to access the question at all. The example that you raised with the Nobel Prize awarded work was a good one because there you undertook an experiment which was seemingly well, possibly impossible at the time, but certainly there was no guarantee that you were going to get the result you looked for, which was classes of genes that would control segmentation. So there’s a bravery and talent involved in choosing the right question. / You were both in your first independent investigator roles when you did that work and I suppose one might have played it a bit safe at that point and just tried to get something under your belt to get the jobs. But obviously just that wasn’t …",
    "And then to me, not being a scientist at all, I understand that there must have been times when it was very difficult and maybe one of you wanted to give up and the other said no come on let’s go ahead …",
    "No, and particular when you’re still trying to establish yourself, there must have been the thought in the back of both your minds that what may happen is that one of us gets ahead on the back of this work.",
    "… there are, people said there are many risks, can you see those risks today, why people … / But if you then go in and if you can control it, the humans can go on. / Were there times when you really despaired, said No, I think I’m going to give this up, it’s too much work, or too much people might not believe in what I’m doing?",
    "To be able to understand this valuable research that scientists are doing and which often takes many, many years, you then have to be able to explain it as well and I read a beautiful story that your daughter came up with. Could you just briefly relate them to us, as a way of describing what you found out. / But that is amazing, so those evolutionary genes, the way I could relate to, is that somehow, we are connected, all of us.",
    "Maybe I will discover my questions completely redundant, but let’s say you two are at least following the questioning in the same general vein and yes, it’s taking you to new places. You, on the other hand, have seemed to jump from one question to another, but there is almost a clear break between one question and the next and they seem from the outside the two different ways to do science. One is to say, There is a problem, I will work on it for a while and then I will look for another problem, actively go and find a different problem. Would that be fair to say? / But what I was going to ask was what for you is the attraction of jumping from question to question. / Is there also an attraction in going to less populated places?",
    "That is really wonderful. Staying for a moment with pre-clinical and clinical medicine I would ask you something that relates to the Nobel Prize and some discussion which comes out now and then and which was obvious in some of the journeys last year. That is a question of pre-clinical prizes or prizes to basic science vs prizes to clinical science and to clinical medicine. I think that many of us have a feeling that it would be very nice to be able to give more prizes to clinical medicine. Do you think that clinical medicine is sometimes neglected in this respect?",
    "Yes, perhaps. But there still is this problem of consciousness of the subjective perception of the world. It’s sometimes called explanatory gap, how can our emotions and our perceptions translate into the hardware of the brain. Do you think that neurophysiology can jump over this gap or fill it in?",
    "In some ways your beginnings were similar in that you both came from a chemistry background and when I spoke with Roger yesterday he was saying that chemistry was really the fundamental thing you needed to know in order to understand biology and he said that in very elegant terms. I presume, since you majored in chemistry yourself, that you’d agree with him totally?",
    "You see it now as a very good candidate for a drug target in microbiology? / Biofilms are another area that hasn’t been very investigated. / Except you have your candidate molecules.",
    "How did your collaboration with co-laureates Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson begin? / How important is collaboration?",
    "Your co-laureate Guido Imbens, you have known for a long time, haven’t you?",
    "You are good friends with your co-laureate Guido Imbens, and were even best man at his wedding. Can you tell us a little about your friendship?",
    "We understand that you are close friends with your collaborator and co-laureate Joshua Angrist – and that he was even the best man at your wedding. Do you think it’s important to become friends with your collaborators?",

    "How long have you known your fellow laureate Daniel Kahneman?",
    "I know of course that you were Finn’s advisor, but I’m really very curious about this time inconsistency, or consistency result, however you like to put it. How did you start with this in the first place? I know you produced the thing in Bergen in 1975, but I guess you had some idea, why you just picked this problem and you got together in Bergen in ‘75?",
    "Some researchers work in teams and some others do more alone work, how does a usual workday look for you?",
    "Well if we turn to your research. I mean one of you has shown that people are frequently irrational in their economic decision making and the other has shown that the market mechanism works efficiently, at least in the lab. How would you reconcile these seemingly different views, I mean both of you? / I guess he was a philosopher of moral philosophy wasn’t he?",
    "You have both a background in mathematics and physics and perhaps physics is often regarded as an ideal for research. Also economics. Some critics may say that perhaps at the same time economics become more and more like a branch of applied mathematics, how do you react to that criticism of economics?",
    "Have you encountered any failures or mistakes in your career?",

    "Can you tell us about your approach to solving problems?",
    "What’s the toughest challenges you’ve faced? How did you overcome it?",
    "Good one. I wanted to ask you a little bit – and we touched on this slightly before – but we talked a lot about successes and if I asked you which was the proudest moment of your career I’m pretty sure I know what the answer will be, but I’d like to also talk about failure because I think that shapes your route to success as well for people who hang in there and make it past a failure. Have you had any failures or anything that you would regard as a failure?",
    "Both of you have worked in the frontier between different fields; economics and psychology and natural sciences with experiments. What kind of difficulties or what kind of challenges did that implement for you?",
    "How do you move past failures and disappointments in your work?",

    "Your three students that become laureates – can you tell us a bit about them?",
    "How do you tackle resistance?",
    "How do you deal with failure or writer’s block?",
    "I just wanted to ask you actually after the Canopus in Argos books, you published what I suppose I’ve always taken as being a bit of a sort of rejoinder to the people who perhaps complained, critics who complained that you weren’t doing realism anymore because you publish The Diary of a Good Neighbour under a pseudonym, Jane Somers, didn’t you? I wonder if you could tell us about that little strategy?",
    "Tell us about your collaboration with Wim Wenders on ‘Wings of Desire’.",
    "How do you see the interplay between filmmaking, art and writing?",
    "How does the issue of sustainability appear in your work?",
    "I have to ask you before we get to the close a little about your latest book because it’s apparent that if we move onto the books you’ve written in this century, you have begun to exploit the history of your own family in a way that you didn’t do before. Of course this started in the 90’s with books like Onitsha who is partly a story about your experience of Africa and your father’s experience of Africa but not quite, and a book like La Quarantaine also has a lot of material that has to do with Mauritius and your family background, and this wonderful story of, was it your grandfather Jacques, who saw Rimbaud coming out of the bistro at the corner of Rue Madame in Saint-Sulpice – that becomes a sort of legend that you have to follow on, but as you read these books, Révolutions, for instance, or L’Africain and now Ritournelle de la faim you realise that you’re not quite telling the real story, those are not facts, this is still a novel. It’s sometimes called a semi-autobiographical but that’s a rather elusive term I think. Which is the relationship actually in those books between fiction and actuality",
    "And I mean, formally it’s quite a … I mean, it’s a fairly extraordinary book now, but it must have been a very strange one, I think, for its first readers in all these different kind of … these multiple narratives reflecting different aspects of the protagonist’s experience. I mean, do you remember sort of devising that? / What about then after that, there’s a novel that you published in 1985 which I confess is a favourite one of mine which I read soon after it was first published, The Good Terrorist, which seems in a way, although it’s about its own times, it seems also to take you back a bit to that territory of these sort of groups of self righteous so called idealists or political idealists.",
    "In your books history is presented in various ways, and from different perspectives. For example, you could say that sometimes history appears to be repeating itself. Whereas in other books we find the themes and motifs of slow progress and symbols such as snails, Sisyphus etc. How do these two ideas or ways of grasping history interact in the books?",
    "And further to that stimulus, to the stimulus at home and from within your community, a lot of your writing has very sort of deep classical allusions. You’ve written ‘The Odyssey’, you know, you’ve reinterpreted it in your writing so what academic career did you pursue?",
    "Do you think that once you began to recognise that injustice, that humiliation, you began to sort of piece together a more three-dimensional picture of black South Africans as opposed to the many South Africans who either supported or ignored apartheid, who never really let black people come into focus as real people to them? / You write from very, very diverse points of view, very diverse characters, diverse situations. You write about gender, you write about sex, you write about injustice, you write about race.",
    "Is that part of your African tradition? Because obviously you’re writing for very diverse audiences and audiences with diverse literary capacities. Some of your audiences may be completely illiterate. Is it important to you that you reach all of those audiences and is theatre a strong vehicle for that? / Do you feel a duty, do you feel bound to give a voice to your community? Yesterday at the reading you talked about reinforcing the civic voice.",
    "How do you work? How does an novel originate?",
    "If you look back on your work, do you see any recurring theme or recurring perspective? / This sounds like psychology to me. Have you found an answer?",
    "In this book there is a violent clash between the north, an ancient north African culture that is based on the desert people, and the French culture or the culture of Europe, we can say the urbanised Europe. What were your sources in describing this traditional north African culture?",
    "In The Black Book there’s also for a western reader this magic of the fluent identities that sometimes even borders on Metempsychosis and is this something that came to you during the writing? Because you have the element of course in The White Castle, but it’s so much more poetic in The Black Book. /Yes, this is true, I mean there is this rivalry for instance in Snow between the poet Ka and Blue, the religious leader, they are struggling for the same woman, for the same women, and God knows who comes out victorious because you leave lots of things open in that novel. And it comes to a moment towards the end of the book which I find particularly fascinating when Ka is actually betraying Blue to the security forces and he’s killed, and why does he do that? We’re never told, but there’s one hypothesis that’s put forward is that Ka suddenly came to realise that he is not as he had believed, the sublime poet, he’s the poet clerk and it’s the other one who is so to say chosen by the gods. I find that particularly arresting I must say and it brings to mind something that i personally feel to be one of your sort of … one of the keys to your work, now I’m advancing a very, daring hypothesis, but I have to do it, namely that jealousy is one of your main things. / Yes, on the other hand one has to ask oneself at some point whether this possibility of sharing is universal, I mean you deny the clash of civilisation, right, and of course what you show in your writing is how things go around and return from unexpected directions and things that you believed to be foreign are actually very close to yourself, and vice versa. On the other hand I as a western reader, a Nordic reader, have to ask myself if there is something in your books that you believe is difficult for a northerner or a westerner to understand. Let me point to one rather peculiar detail in one of your books, in Istanbul, when you speak about some famous travel logs written by French poets in the 19th century, Gérard de Nerval, Voyage en Orient. I’ve read that book, it’s a marvellous book, I mean it’s a marvellous description of what he calls Constantinople, at the beginning of his visit to Constantinople he gets out to look at the Sultan, you know, and you have picked this up, and the Sultan is leaving his carriage and Nerval believes that he meets the eye of the Sultan, do you remember that?",
    "And once you arrive at A House for Mr Biswas things are very different in your writing. Why was that?",
    "However, your last book, My Century, is exactly the opposite to a normal history book in that you focus on small, everyday details, such as buying ice-skates or the remains of a teddy bear or the significance of winter tyres. Why did you choose to account for your century in this way? / I think that is very well said. That is why literature has been unpopular with the powerful, because it shows that there is more than one truth. And perhaps it is the case that if writers claim there is only one truth, as for example Pound did, then literature becomes a danger to itself. It damages itself. / Yes, and that is indeed an issue of perspective and the question is: “What has happened?”. And that can be answered in a variety of ways. But it is also the case that if you’ve worked out what has happened, then you have to make a judgement. Again this can be done in a variety of ways.\n\nThere was indeed a concept in twentieth century literature, now virtually disappeared, the demonic, that is to say something that is neither good nor evil, that is unclassifiable, and yet remains a power. I am thinking, for instance in your books, of the character of the black cook in The Tin Drum. She is definitely demonic, isn’t she?",
    "In the prelude to your collected poems, there’s a passage: “Until I’ve learned to suffer in accurate iambics”. What does that refer to?",
    "You draw lots on your Yoruba culture, you draw a lot on Ogun, you draw a lot on the cosmology of your people. How does that distinguish your work from other writers?",
    "Yes. And you were writing also, I don’t know if this is a fair way of describing that some of your books from the late 80s and the 1990s they seem sort of just like Shakespeare wrote problem plays, I think you wrote some problem novels. So there’s The Fifth Child for instance, about a couple who think they’re going to have this kind of wonderful blissful family life and they have a sort of malevolent child. Or there’s Love, Again about a woman in the1990s, about a woman who thinks all the sort of tumult of passion is perhaps with relief passed and then she falls in love again. I mean is that a … to think of them as problem."

    "A question that I often ask, but what is it that you enjoy the most about the practice of science? About the science that you do?",

    "Turning to your own development, you took some time to decide what you wanted to be when you were young, I gather from your autobiography. And eventually settled on medicine initially, how did that path come about?",
    "What drove you into science?",
    "Did it come naturally? Was that when you were growing up, were you a scientist as a child, do you think? / You found your clique.",
    "Did you know when you were a child that you wanted to be a scientist then?",
    "Then the first question. How did you come into your research field and what were your initial steps in the field that lead you to your future career? / That’s the usual time, because there is a time difference and this time difference from the decision to reaching the West Coast, US, makes that early in the morning for you. But I meant how did you come into exactly that field, because it must have been a long story before that too.",
    "How old were you when you decided that this is the way you wanted to go?",
    "I have the pleasure of sitting here with professor Joseph Murray, who won the Nobel Prize in 1990 for his work on organ transplantation. If I can start this little talk and say that from studying and from learning to know you it is quite clear that medicine was always a primary choice and that it was clear that you would become a physician from very early on. My first question is really when was it clear that you would be a researcher as well, what stimulated the early interest in research in you?",
    "I’d like to start, if I may, by exploring your scientific beginnings a little and I don’t know where they began so I don’t know where to start, but perhaps at University of Pennsylvania where you read chemistry and then did an MD. Did you know at that time that you were set to become a serious scientist?",
    "Dr Baltimore, you have been an active scientist for close to 40 years. How did it all started; how did you get into science?",

    "What motivated you to live a life in science?",
    "It is an obvious point, but obviously you were enjoying yourself tremendously and going in on Christmas morning was just something that was natural and the enjoyment of what you do is key, is absolutely the essence of it. Its not work, its enjoyable, I presume. / Perhaps it’s too big a question to ask whether its changing for the good or for the bad. Its presumably going in both directions in the same time.",
    "And that fascinated you from the beginning?",
    "No, no, not at all. The ICOS story in particular raises the spectre of biotech and the enzymes you discovered are at the very heart of the biotechnology industry and you yourself have been very intimately involved in it. Would it be fair to ask you what influence you think biotech has had on the practice of life science?",
    "What makes you most passionate right now with your research?",
    "What makes you passionate about science and your work?",
    "But then finally, Arvid Carlsson, do you agree with Eric Kandel that there may be a totally new way of looking on the dynamics of the brain, which is really at the heart of his statements? / And maybe even get a picture of the conscious experience then on the screen.",
    "You inherited this sort of semi-secret stock of knowledge?",
    "Because people are betting on the number and there is a need for an authoritative answer to this question from the gambling point of view and from the human centred views that we entertain. To drive these large projects, the human genome project, obviously there have been precursors, people have got news from physics now that they are enormous projects, big physics and you now have big biology coming around, so once the human genome project has been completed, how will we proceed? I think we would agree that the most important thing now is to find out how the genome functions and we now enter then a type of research where we want to study the ultimate products, the proteins. Since there are many ways in which you can process the information from the DNA and the genome, at the RNA level, there are many more proteins to be found. This field of studying the proteins made in biological systems is called proteomics, so do you see any such big proteomics coming along and what can be done in terms of technology to speed up the analysis of the much larger number of proteins than the number of genes?",

    "What’s your story?",
    "What brought you to Economic Sciences?",
    "What turned you on to be an economist in the first place?",
    "So how did all start? Why did you decide to become economists? Was it just a coincidence or was it something that you had planned for a long time?",
    "Well Professor Kahneman, what made you decide to become a scientist? / Well how important has it been to you? I mean your scientific result can be applied to, what did Nobel say, to the benefit of mankind? I mean you followed your track, you found something that was interesting and pursued that?",
    "Yes, and the first question would be how did you decide to study economics? And maybe we could start with George?",
    "My name is Bertil Holmlund. I am interviewing the two Laureates in Economic Sciences this year: Professor Daniel McFadden from University of California at the Berkley and Professor James Heckman from University of Chicago. They have received the Prize for their contributions to micro econometrics, which is a field on the boundary between economics and statistics. This interview takes place at the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm on December 13, a couple of days after the Laureates have received the Prize. I think I should like to start by asking you how it all began. How come that you started to study economics seriously? Was it more or less by accident or was it something that you had wanted to do for a long time?",
    "This is very much the international background, but at that time in the world economy, most countries had fixed exchange rates, the Bretton Woods system, and also international mobility of capital was very low. Still, you emphasised the international capital mobility and the floating exchange [- – -] Where you influenced by the fact that you were a Canadian, that Canada had this somewhat special regime? Canada had the floating exchange rate from time to time and maybe capital mobility was higher also between Canada and the United States? Was your Canadian background important for your inspiration?",
    "It seems that it continued to fascinate you over a number of years because you have, which I found very interesting, worked with a lot of researchers, scientists from other academic disciplines. What made you want to do that?",
    "Tell us about your motto “Swing for the fences.”",
    "What motivation drives your tremendous sense of curiosity?",
    "How do you maintain your focus and motivation?",
    "How do you maintain your curiosity?",
    "How did your experimental approach to economics begin?",
    "How has the world interpreted your award?",
    "Why are you so interested in the development of new, rather than existing cities?",
    "Has luck played a role in your life?",
    "At any given time you obviously have several questions in your mind that you want to find answers for in your research. How do you choose which ones to pursue first and spend most of your efforts on?",
    "I’ve heard that you are a big football enthusiast, so if you had to choose Norway winning the world championships or you winning the Nobel Prize, what will you choose?",
    "And second, you’re very welcome now to the Nobel Foundation for this discussion or conversation. You were rewarded for, in particular, having provided the basic tool of analysis or model to help us understand how economic policy functions in a world with high international mobility of capital. And how monetary and fiscal policy have different effects on national economies if we have floating exchange rates or fixed exchange rates. What was the inspiration of your work? To what extend was it that you looked up the world and saw some problems? And to what extent were you inspired by peer groups, by other scholars, by your teachers, etcetera?",
    "Has it changed your working life in the sense that you are now demanded to answer questions about all sorts of problems that have to do with world economy?",
    "You said in your speech, I believe, or maybe it was later in your biography, that you were hoping, by having now the age of 66, that you would achieve much more professionally. Do you feel that you have had the opportunity and the time to do that, or have your time been mainly taken up by giving lectures or travelling around, being a celebrity?",
    "When do you get your best ideas?",
    "What other interests have shaped your career and outlook?",
    "Where does your curiosity come from?",
    "I read that you were very good at maths as a child, but it wasn’t a straight road. You were also taking philosophy at university and you were interested in developmental issues, and you certainly liked, I read, to supervise research of the students that you worked with, you know. What was your main driving force during this development from your student years and forward? What was the main driving force for you?",
    "What was it in the game theory that really fascinated you? I’m not sure, I just want to make a simple assumption here, that when you deal with game theory you’re really looking into predicting human actions?",
    "I want to come to a question which has more to do with politics really. The way the United States today is acting in the Middle East. The way the US economy has been affected over the last couple of years, the huge budget deficit. Does it scare you, what’s going on at the moment in terms of the US involvement?",
    "How did your writing career start?",
    "Could you tell us about your childhood and where your passion for reading and writing came from?",
    "How does your writing process begin?",
    "When did you decide to become a writer?",
    "What made you become a writer?",
    "Mr Mo Yan, I’d like to congratulate you to the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature. First of all, I’d like to ask you… You were born in a village in Shandong to illiterate parents, so how did you start writing?",
    "Still, I mean reading a book, if we move a bit ahead now in the list of your books, we come to a remarkable thing like L’extase matérielle. I find it very hard to imagine that book written in any other language but the French, this mixture of very good prose and “discours” which seems to be so very French, can you give us an idea of how you decide such a book, what made you write it in this way?",
    "Why did you become a writer? Who inspired you?",
    "Derek Walcott, welcome to the interview. You were the Nobel Literature Laureate in 1992. Tell us where did it all start? What unique combination of circumstances gave Derek Walcott to the world?",
    "Isn’t that rather unusual for an author of your stature that you have, you know, the process has come from within? How have you developed yourself as a writer? How have you developed the powers of language, the descriptive powers, the idiom that you have created? Where does that all come from? Is that just hard work?",
    "What made you become a writer and who inspired your career?",
    "What inspired you to start writing?",
    "What do you need in order to be creative?",
    "Would you say that travel and movement is a key theme in your work?",
    "What has influenced your writing style and for whom are you writing?",
    "So how did you start writing? Did you decide to do it by yourself?",
    "Well then, if we move ahead a bit quickly now and come to something that to me looks like the sort of turning point in your career as a writer, the novel which is in French it’s called Désert, Desert, which came out in 1980 and was a big success and seems to have been the first book to give you a wide readership, not only in France but in many other countries. It was also, I think, celebrated by the French Academy which is something very unexpected in your case, you got a prize, I don’t remember the exact name of it but it’s a sort of novel prize that’s given by the French Academy. How did you come to write that book which is so different from your early books?",
    "Can you remember what impelled you to write it? / And in the 1990s, I mean you were writing these novels and more that we haven’t talked about. In the 1990s, you wrote a couple of volumes of autobiography as well which I think some people like as much as your novels. But you stopped in 1962 with those. I mean they only take your life to 1962. Why did you decide?",
    "And what does that bring to the culture? What does that bring to you as a writer?",
    "You know, there was the recognition of the injustice. There must have been the anger that you felt. What nurtured and fed your voice?",
    "Do you know the end of your novel when you start writing?",
    "That is a very interesting analogy. When you started writing, what was your reason? What were you thinking about? / This reason for you… What is your reason for writing today?",
    "My name is Horace Engdahl, I am the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish academy, and here beside me is Mr Orhan Pamuk, the literary Nobel Laureate of the year 2007. [Editor’s correction: Pamuk was awarded the 2006 prize.] Welcome. First question I would like to ask you to describe the circumstances around your first book? How you came to write it and what kind of writer you thought you were going to be when you wrote it."

Now this is a device that enables us to look at the surface of objects at the atomic scale, by means of a probe which skims over the surface and records variations in the topography below it with minute current fluctuations.

It’s a nice part of chemistry, organic chemistry, that the reactions named after their inventors. So, all these characters live on through the pages of the organic synthesis textbooks. Do you know where that convention came from, that reactions should be named after the people who made them?",

    "Coming to that in a second. As you were working through these discoveries which would take you further and further away from the known universe so to speak, were you not worried that other people, bigger labs, would pick up on what you were publishing and just take it away faster than you could keep up?",

    "William Knowles, Ryoji Noyori and Barry Sharpless, my congratulations for this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry. And also welcome to this Nobel interview. All three of you are organic chemists and this means that you are looking into the chemistry of life. How would you describe the work of an organic chemist? Is the work that you are doing in your laboratories trying to imitate what nature does in the real world? Is this the right description?",

    "Along the path from physics to at least biophysics and biochemistry had you also had brushes with other branches of science? Had chemistry figured for instance at that stage?",
    "So, if I understand right, it took over one year for you to actually succeed with your experiments?",
    "Where does that leave biology?",
    "Do you think things are still the same when you study physics? Is chemistry still seen as a second-class subject?",

I mean with the Western World and governments in the Western World has to rethink? / I mean even if you take, you know, the classic economic person argument where everyone cares only about his or her welfare, you know, narrowly construed, which is a terrible view to have to take, but even if you take that view, I think, you know, what you’re suggesting I believe makes great sense. It undoubtedly is worthwhile for people in the highly developed countries to do more than they’re doing now, to redress some of the disparity between highly developed and highly undeveloped or far less developed countries, just as a matter of pure self interest. Now, of course, if you add to that some concern for other people, then you’d get an even stronger case, so I do not think, and I will say mea culpa especially in the case of the United States. I don’t’ think we’re doing anywhere near enough from a humanitarian developmental aspect, strictly from a self interest standpoint, and of course I would think we should do more than that, but that’s my personal preferences. Shall we.",

Why is that so difficult for people to accept, I mean the way you were met with this criticism, for example, what did it do to your research work and why was it so controversial?",
    "I can see that you can analyze a situation in which a firm is saying should we have this component made outside, buy it in or should we make it ourselves? But you have been able to turn that into theories which suggest in which circumstances the make decision is correct, which circumstances the buy decision is correct and then those theories have been put out to empirical testing and they presumably refine the theory. Is it now, are you able to suggest principles by which firms can govern their decision to the make-or-buy decision? / Is this very much an area of on-going study? Do we know the strength and weaknesses of the firm versus the market or is this just something that is going to continue to evolve as firms evolve and the world becomes more global and all of this? / I am getting into hot water by using such terms.

    "I think from what you’re saying it’s really comparative how much you need and there is a certain idea maybe in the so called Western World that we need more than we actually do need. It’s a certain greed which has kind of taken resources from so called Third World countries. Does it lead to wishes of further wealth which is maybe …?",

How was it for you? Were you very interested in maths, for example? Did you feel that you have a special gift for that?",
    "Already at an early age the course of your childhood and the difficulties that your Jewish background created growing up in Germany you were deprived of opportunities and that it was hard at times but you have said in your biography that it made you act and think independently as well. Which way has that shaped you, do you think, if you would like to elaborate?",

    "To my knowledge none of you has studied economics as undergraduates and this means that you have a background in another discipline. How did that affect your research when you were doing?",
    "What about the asymmetric information? I always wondered why things happened in the ‘60’s and early ‘70’s, why didn’t it happen earlier or why did it happen at this time?",

    "One sort of boundary you crossed was to move across to the East coast to do graduate work, and you chose Yale. Was that an easy choice?",
    "I wondered because we have just heard a panel discussion on creative milieus in science and certain things were brought up there, among those differences between Europe and America. I would like to come back to this and ask you the question: if you compare the creativity and the milieus in the Theorell laboratory when you came as a post-doc, with the Cori laboratory and your time in America, at that time were there obvious differences? Was one more European and the other more American? Or were they pretty similar would you say?",

    "Obviously it suits you. What is it about the place that’s so right? / Does the smallness of the department and indeed of the small-town feel contribute to your ability to stay in science? Because one of the unusual things about you is that you still do several hours bench work a day.",

    "We’re a bit jumping out of temporal sequence, but when you found yourself in industry in the 1980s and 1990s, were you able to apply the same principles to allowing people to do their own experiments?",
    "It seems that quite an important event was attending the experimental medicine course in Zurich, which was 40 years ago or so almost, and that seems to be quite precocious in a way because now experimental medicine is much talked of and people are really investing in it. For Zurich to have a department of experimental medicine at that point seems to be ahead of its time.",

    "Where did the extra demand come from though, because basically what medical schools do now is what they did 40 years ago?",
    "You have worked both for the university and for companies, industries … / How do you they compare? / In what way? / So you’re afraid of a blacklash …",
    "I know there was a positive slant on the way you said it and I’m glad to hear it. When you gave your banquet speech in Stockholm, you mentioned that there were two attributes you saw were essential to good clinical research, one is basic science and basic science training and you’ve touched on that. The other was a technical courage, the ability to go out and try new things and you mentioned that for instance with cell culture in your approach to FH but how do you go about making sure that these two attributes are taught to the medical students here? / I imagine that the MD PhD programme forces people to take the time to take the other approach because otherwise you are just so pressured by the need to get through your exams and get onto the next stage that you just can’t afford to step away from great learning.",
    "But the need for, as you say, pharma to reinvent itself on a regular cycle means that they need a discovery engine which creates new possibilities although that very phrase discovery engine is rather worrying because it indicates that it should happen in some kind of processed way and discovery probably I suppose doesn’t happen like that. But is there, therefore, a need to take basic drug research from wherever one can possibly find it and to broaden the base of research that’s feeding into the pharma pipeline. / The story illustrates at least two things, one is that the importance of biology and the importance of understanding the relevance of the target and also the ability to take risks, the ability to have enough programmes going at once that if you do find that it was a mistake to block cholesterol production you can abandon that approach. / They face an enormous public relations challenge these days.",
    "For example, do you mean the debate around, could we say genetically modified food or genetically modified species like for example Dolly … / You mention theology, as you said there has often been a conflict but theology has, a lot of people who are believers of any different disciplines of religion, always have this sort of saying the connection between all human and actually all living beings in some of the …",

    "There have to be a few reservations. I was talking about your students. We talked a little bit about how students have changed over the years. What about educational institutions themselves? How have they changed, in your opinion, over the years? I know you can’t actually generalise across the US and Europe and the rest of the world. But in general what is your feeling about the way that education is going in the institutions? What are they focusing on? / I increasingly get the sensation that when we talk about students, what people study at universities, Sweden is one of those countries, thanks to its social welfare system, where basically anyone who wants a higher education can have one free of charge with the result that a lot of people do study and do have a higher education. At the same time there seems to be a mismatch with this creative situation, where you have lots of highly qualified people but you don’t have the jobs in industry to accommodate them. We talk about growing a services sector here to replace manufacturing jobs and there are too many highly skilled people. Would you agree that this is something that’s happening, not just here but elsewhere as well – perhaps in other Scandinavian countries?",

I mean, I’ve been reading a lot of French writers and even if they often deny this fact quite often it’s so obvious that the very centre of their work is Paris, that’s where everybody wants to go, that’s where everybody wants to make a name, and there are certain rules and there are certain circles that you have to make yourself known by and you have to triumph on a certain scene. And this has been going on in very much the same way for hundreds of years, but somehow you don’t seem to belong to this play, this race, you have to a large extent even ignored it, I should say, could you comment on that? Why did you never quite go to Paris?",

You have a name, but the name is nothing having lent it, other people have called you by that name, and you don’t pronounce your name, other people do. You know, myself, a couple of years ago, I realised that I was no longer sure how my first name should be pronounced. It’s an English name, it comes from my grandmother, and my father used it with an English pronunciation, just like you do. But living in Sweden all my life, the pronunciation’s gradually been corrupted, and now people in the literary world usually say it in quite a different way, and there are three or four pronunciations of it, and when asked myself which is the correct one, I have no answer. Because I never use the name myself. Then I happened to come upon a passage in the letters that you published the other year, between father and son, which is the letters between yourself and your family, and there in a letter to Kamla, it’s your sister I understand, from 1952, you say like this.

    "And since you are the first woman to have been awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in its 40-year history I imagine that is slightly added to the load you have been under. / Oliver Williamson: It is a little bit idiosyncratic but I do think that there is a movement in economics to be more interdisciplinary and in pulling related disciplines together, whereas previously there is and I think there always will be a sense that economics is the prince of the social sciences but that there is a greater appreciation, I think, that there are complex phenomena that if you look at them exclusively through the lens of economics not assisted by any of any of contiguous sciences that you are going to be missing things. One of the things, one of the reasons why I think that I was able to look at some of the issues in anti-trust enforcement differently then was the sort of standard view was that I was part of a really unusual interdisciplinary program in social sciences at Carnegie Tech, then Carnegie Tech, now Carnegie Mellon, in which organization theory was thought to have co-equal status with economics and should both inform and be informed by economics.\n\nThere was sort of traffic across this boundary and I do think that having more of our students exposed to the contiguous social sciences and you know, your principal discipline could be political science and you will reach out to economics and that’s been going alright and could be economics and you reach out to political sciences or sociology and that’s been going on. So I think there is, I don’t think everybody by any means should be sort of multi-disciplinary in their work, but I would hope that there will be growing agreements that these sciences have a lot of common ground and that they should work on it in a collaborative way and then often it’s going to be a better more productive. It’s going to be more interesting as a matter research and it’s going to be more productive for the common well.\n\nElinor Ostrom: I also think interdisciplinarity is a very important. Vincent Ostrom and I established a center called a workshop in political theory and policy analysis back in 1973–74 and we have always had multiple disciplines around the table and that’s just been my life. We now are reaching out more to ecologists because of, if you’re studying forest, you have to learn a little bit more about the ecology of forest because again rules that work well in a deciduous forest don’t work well in a tropical wet forest and trying to understand the ecological foundations is very very tricky and I am having learned a lot of new concepts and new terms.\n\nAre you specializing in forest studies?\n\nElinor Ostrom: No, it happens to be the applied area I am working in now heavily. I have a couple of articles I am working on, irrigation, so we have a large database and we have a book coming out in another 6 months or so assuming all of this. But I have just finished a book that I am very very pleased about with the title “Working together – collective choice, the commons and multiple methods in practice” and the thesis of it is besides interdisciplinary is multiple methods. Sometimes we have people only do a mathematical model or only do only case studies or only do large N and they criticize everything else and the problem is that we need to be able, either if we can’t ourselves do the model, that’s foolish but we need to be aware of the advantages and know enough about some of the methods that we can work with an expert in a method and then bring some of our knowledge from a different set of methods together. I love experimental work, but it doesn’t have the richness that I have when I study forests in the field. I love both of them as ways of different ways of getting insights and sometimes being in the field leads back to the lab. In particular I kept seeing people monitoring and sanctioning each other in the field, amazing times and so I came back from a particular vivid occasion in Nepal and said to my colleague Roy Gardner who is a game theorist and Jimmy Walker who is an experimentalist: Let’s please, let’s do a formal game involving people paying their own cost to sanction others, because in the field if they go this was an instance where someone had dug into an irrigation and so several of them went running down the hill and yelling and screaming and others starting patching it immediately and I mean the energy they put in, they didn’t not think about it. There was no rational calculation about this, they just did it.\n\nWell again and the game theory prediction is they wouldn’t, then we could put it in the lab with a simple game we used earlier, but now changing one attribute and giving them a chance to pay a fee to find someone and they did it even though it’s predicted they won’t and if we gave them eventually the choice of what kind of sanctioning mechanism they had and then allowed them to use it, they got to about 94% of optimal. And here is having the game theory model great because we knew what optimal was and we could put it in the lab and figure out what happened, but that was field lab and now on our forest studies because of our earlier findings we asked quite about monitoring and sanctioning. We are finding that whether people who use a forest actually monitor each other to be more important then who owns. Government ownership, private ownership, community organization – all of those are important but if they, the formal rules are there, and the users don’t see a future and don’t see that they are involved and don’t take an interest and don’t monitor – forest goes down.",

What was it that particularly made him a good teacher, what did he have? / I daresay the job gave you an insight into something that other people weren’t seeing anyway, which paid off later. So, after NIH and Earl Stadtman you then had these three choices that came together, it seems to me that you 1) decided that you were going to move to Dallas, 2) you decided that you were going to work on hypercholesterolemia …",

I was going to more or less end my questioning by coming back to your fantastic career and that you have developed world renowned laboratories, at least three of them, and also recruited so many internationally very well-known scientists and followers.

    "I’m sure your students would actually disagree… which brings me on to another subject that’s actually quite interesting to me and I think probably relevant to lots of students and even people in business, up and coming through business – is the role of mentorship. Who have been your mentors and what have they meant to you? / I’m going jump back to something now and I’m going ask you to think of being even more magnanimous than you have been now, talking about the causes you would dedicate time to. Since 1999 the economics prize has been always a shared prize which makes you break a trend here that we’ve seen. I just wanted to ask you if you could be so magnanimous, if you could choose one person to share your prize, who would it be?",
    "Swedes have a problem now, we have only two Laureates in Economics. We have three in Norway in now and well, today we can’t do very much about that. But I would like to know, did you know Frisch or Haavelmo, have they inspired you or have you heard them lecture?",

    "It’s fascinating to talk to you and I’m really happy that you have spoken to us today. Is there any concerns … I was talking earlier about young students and somebody said to me that the teachers are those who open up doors, but that are the students who have to walk through them themselves. Did you have any teacher through your period at university which was particularly a role model to you? How has it been for you?",
    "I would like to come back to that, looking at it from today’s point of view, but just staying a little bit with your background and your school years. Was it important for your parents and were they influencing you that you would achieve academically? I believe you started off with physics and chemistry and yet you ended up with eonomics and history.",

    "Who or what is your source of inspiration?",
    "Who has most inspired you as a writer?",
    "I’m not sure I could do that in English either really, but coming to this question in another perspective, I feel that today there is a tendency in many parts of the world, in the Western world particularly, to look upon English as a vehicle language. It’s used more and more in all circumstances and there are several realms of research that have been completely taken over by English. In international conferences in the European Union etc we tend to be more and more mono-lingual and even if … I know that the French are defending their positions with a lot of conviction, they find it increasingly hard to do so. But it’s odd and it’s very apparent if you, like me, belong to a small group that has as one of its main tasks to study world literature, to read books from all over the world, to look at the development of universal literature in a broad perspective. It’s quite apparent that there is no such thing as a universal language in the world of literature. The only universal language in literature is translation, and you said earlier this morning on a press conference that for you it’s not only the French literature tradition that is the basis of your writing, but it’s also to a large extent books that you read in translations, English, American books, Scandinavian books, books from lots of other countries. Could you comment a bit on that? Which are the most important non-French writers that sort of belong to you through your literary schooling?"

    "If you ask me what percentage I would go zero upon zero, zero, zero, zero, etc. A tremendous problem will have to be solved. To predict, even in 10 years, you cannot do that. As a friend of mine once said it’s like asking a general of cavalry in 1880 to plan for World War III. He would tell you: Give me ten thousand cavaliers and I’ll protect Washington. You cannot predict, you cannot guess what you cannot imagine. The big problems that will be solved rapidly is genetic therapy, therapeutics, because we begin to understand a little bit the regulation of genes, the tremendous problems. To say: Oh, we’ll solve that in 10 years, it’s nonsense, I don’t know when, but it will. I’m certain we will be able to regenerate nerves when nerves are cut. I am sure that we will be able to grow stem cells, in all cases aplastic anaemias and things like, replace that, so many therapeutic problems will be solved. In my field which is cell signalling, there are many pathways, we begin to know those pathways, we know all the enzymes that are involved but enzymes are words, we know bits and pieces of phrases, but we don’t know the language, a cell has to speak among pathways to co-ordinate all those reactions, we don’t know that language. More importantly we don’t know the language that the cell has to speak with another cell to co-ordinate the development of multi-cellular organisms where messages have to be sent back and forth from one cell to the other. This communication has been crucial to the establishment of the very complex networks of communication we have in embryonic morphogenesis in the immune system, in the brain where you have some more than a thousand million cells speaking with one another through something like 10 million billion synapses, ultimately leading to generation of thought, memory, consciousness. That’s one of the huge challenges that faces the biologists.",
    "What was the question you wanted to have answered?",
    "Coming back to the theme of today’s panel discussion which was extremely interesting, I would like to ask you, as we know that some people objected to the development of medicine and surgery at the time, did you experience much opposition, like people came up and told you that one shouldn’t do such things as transplant organs between different individuals? / I guess, as you have said, it was very important that the first operation was successful.",
    "We should move on, but last question on this shared lab topic, there’s a current trend for shared first authorship to try and get away from the problem of distributing experiments among individuals when they were actually done by more than one person. Do you have a view on the way to proceed there, because it sounds as if you should.",
    "Welcome to this Nobel interview, Professor Torsten Wiesel. You have devoted your long career in science to studies of the visual processing in the brain and now we can say, and we know, that this is not a simple thing, a simple process, rather a result of a long process that begins in the eyes but definitely does not stop here. / But even after the Nobel Prize you continued your research? / The field of brain studies has developed tremendously since you entered it in the ’50s. What do you find is the most interesting challenges in neurophysiology today?",

    "If we look at the biomedical benefits of the DNA sequence of the human genome, I’m sure when Jim Watson went to congress, he had many ideas on what the benefits would be and tried to convince the congress and I noticed also that Bill Clinton mentioned cancer, the cure of cancer would be something that would be following after the sequencing. How do you see the immediate consequences in the biomedical field of our knowledge of the human genome sequence?",
    "This time in the mid 1970s was also a very critical time for the development of recombinant DNA technology, I think -75 was a critical year. You together with some prominent scientists raised the warning finger and you convened a meeting in Asilomar to discuss what the implications of the new recombinant DNA technology could be and the risks involved. That also led to a moratorium of gene cloning or recombinant DNA work in Cambridge, Harvard and MIT. Could you tell a little about why you took that step and whether that was a thing you would re-do if you would re-live it. / We live in a very exciting time in science today with genome projects, we have gone from viruses to bacteria to simple organism, now we have the human genome to attend to. Could you predict what this will mean for the scientific development and the implications of the human genome?",
    "There are several other interesting aspects I would like to bring up in this interview, and that is when you returned to Belgium from the United States, you returned to go back to your work, maybe you had gone back to your insulin work already at the time, and you had pursued that very actively for a long period of time. You went back to Belgium and then during the late 1950s you changed your direction of research.",

Can you foresee other phenomenas in other part of matters of behave that could be used for even more spectacular imaging techniques coming in the future? You just talk about protos, what about all the other atoms? / But when it comes to functional imaging we have seen some spectacular films on moving hearts and intestine moving. How far can this be driven do you think? There are hormones running around in our body, there are nerve impulses going around. Will it ever be possible to make imaging of the way life is functioning in such a detail ever?",

One aspect that is growing up is the therapeutic implications of the fact that telomere shortening was seen to be associated with the disease states and indeed the maintenance of telomere length in both directions seems to be important, maintained equilibrium is important. What do you feel are the potential therapeutic benefits of studying telomerase and telomeres?",
    "It became, as many people have reported, quite a competitive area later on, but at that point, when the epidemic was just beginning, was it a very collaborative field to be in? Were people helping each other? / There are many types of HPV, is it changing? Has there been a rise in cervical cancer do you think, because of changes in HPV over recent history?",

    "The history of science is very often connected to new instruments and hands shift in paradigm or quite a new way of looking on the world. I mean Galileo and the telescope and Leeuwenhoek and the microscope. So what about the MRI and Lauterbur? / But in what way do you think that the possibility of looking into the body and looking into the brain, will it in a way change the way we look upon ourselves and the life we live or give us new explanations? / Which is chemistry. Have you started to formulate some new hypothesis about how life originated on earth?",

    "Is that a debate that goes on though, among the scientists?",
    "I think you gave a very good answer to this difficult question, and you did it so well you’ll have another difficult question after all, and that is there are many ways of treatment, one is the genetic therapy for the future like you just said, there’s also transplantation. I was recently at the lecture where we were told all the benefits from transplantation, and I saw this drug treatments like using inhibitors and receptor agonists and so on. How do you see the future between these three fields, do you think we will soon be overtaken with genetic therapy or soon overtaken with transplantation?",
    "One last question on the pharma, there’s a large growth in the field that is called experimental medicine, these days, but experimental medicine is basically what you’ve been talking about all the time isn’t it?",
    "Will it be possible to sequence a genome of individuals in the short time, in such a short time that it would be important in medical practice, in designing the therapy one is planning for a certain disease?",
    "Sure, but despite your being persuaded that there’s more than the reductionist approach, which of course you knew, there is nevertheless I think now quite a rush towards in vivo work. And does that, do you think confuse issues, the fact that people want to get into the animal as quickly as they can? / In thinking about the appeal of science to people coming into the subject, do you think that the move towards genomics and metabolomics and the rest of it, has in some way distanced people from the ability to become excited by science?",

Sydney Brenner, could you expand a little on that? / When the genome project was almost finished, President Clinton and the British Prime Minister met at a press conference announcing this completion of the genome. Then President Clinton said: “Now, maybe we have seen the language in which God created Man”, and Sydney Brenner, you wrote a comment on that.",

You had quite early exposure to science, and biomedical science in particular, through your father. / Is there any lingering sense of a career that you might have done other than the one you’ve chosen?",
    "The fact that you read chemistry and then did medicine, I guess that’s a fairly standard path here but do you think that contributed a lot to your approach to medicine, doing basic science prior to clinical science?",

Then, a bit later you also were recruited as a professor to the Rockefeller University as it was at the time, and from my early time in research, I remember you having passes to major research institutions or research groups, both contributing enormously to the cell biology field. How did that come about and how important were these two appointments, the two milieus?",

I know that during the Clinton Administration you were approached about a job in the Administration.",
    "What are the things that you think today are being overlooked in terms of variables that are being looked at for economic policy? / This is something that we hear about continuously across Europe, and I know specifically in Sweden we’ve just recently had a change of government which wants to be more entrepreneur friendly because we are losing manufacturing jobs, like most other countries. But how do you really breed entrepreneurs and how do you really support them? In what way would you suggest that politicians actually do it?",

That can be quite a dissolution at time, so it’s important for people to understand it can take time for one to work out what one should be doing.",
    "So as some last thoughts, what advice would you offer to young people who want to come into the area and search for causative agents for these diseases?",
    "You mentioned mentorship and obviously you’ve both been the recipients of great mentorship. What’s that taught you about your own practice of mentoring? / Could you summarise just a couple of the things perhaps that you try and practice as a mentor for your students? / That neatly brings me onto the question of your youth, you’re both very young and this is going to bring considerably greater notoriety. How do you think it’s going to affect your future research paths and that question of distance from your students is certainly one aspect?",
    "But given the path, the experience of the path of science you know that when you’re looking for one thing you always pop up with something else, so those who are going to finance you with a specific goal will probably find themselves financing some totally different knowledge not that they really knew they were looking for.",
    "What would you … if I considered to go into medical research, what do you suggest that I should think of?",
    "When you have students coming through or when you had students coming through the lab and now you have whole faculties to look after and you see people making their choices and you want to help them go the right path, is it possible to reflect on what sort of mentor you are to people? / I suppose it’s a question of time. It’s the spontaneous coming out like for dinner?",
    "But now, if you are a graduate student today looking for what to do during a career in biology and you see these large enterprises doing all the sequencing, so all the sequences will be available, you can’t get the PhD out of sequencing anything as an individual.",
    "How do you relate that to young students of today, your story and the way you worked and what qualities do they have to have to go on?",
    "So your supervisor buys a licence maybe, to have the detailed sequence for a certain genome, so does that leave the individual graduate student then with trying to define the role of specific proteins or signalling systems?",
    "But this sounds also that the young people that are fostered into doing research and into science they are also fostered to be quite opportunistic."

Is there a reason for that, do you think? / We will pick up your question, why is it aberrant in other fields do you think?",
    "Does that also mean that you are looking for inspiration from other areas of science, like scientists who are dealing with the mathematics, the complex system, dealing with the scientists from economy are trying to do mathematics for complex systems. / But somehow you are advisors to the companies and some of you work inside the companies, and you are funded by money from the company. How do you look upon your credibility when it comes to funding in this respect. / I mean have an interest in thing is not only financial interest. Today I think almost every research is interest driven, you have strategic interests, you have environmental interests, you have commercial interests, you have carrier interests, so what about the credibility of a scientist when they are all driven by interests.",

    "Yes, Carol’s is less depressing, yes. So back to the experiment, together you demonstrated that telomeres from one species could protect DNA from an entirely unrelated species and thus the mechanism of the telomere protection was more fundamental than perhaps one might have though initially. And that result was very clear, you understood that immediately so where you aware of what an important piece of information you had just discovered at the time? / And you also observed that the telomeres in yeast were lengthening and that something had to be causing that lengthening and that’s when you come into the story, because you set out to find the activity that was causing the lengthening. / Okay, so back to the enzyme, the enzyme you discovered was unusual, it was a reverse transcriptase with extra protein and RNA and it took some time to sort all that out. When you did sort it out, it turned out that it solved the end replication problem because this problem had been laying around for a while unsolved of how DNA polymerase, well the fact that DNA polymerase could not, on its own, synthesize both chains of DNA to the end. And it seems strange that that problem had been there without anybody being able to solve it for quite a long time. DNA polymerase was revealed in 1958 by Kornberg and it was pointed out in what 1970 or so, 1972 by Watson and others, there was this problem. And it was the late 80s or mid 80s the solution came. /I think it’s your own phrase … I have heard you say it. They were known in the 1930s, it was known that they had an important protective role of the chromosomes, but people didn’t know what they were. It was you in the late 1970s that sorted out the molecular nature. / And you got this now famous Christmas present in 1984, the first indication that you got your hands on the activity that was causing the lengthening of the telomeres.",
    "I can imagine. The prize was awarded for a very concrete discovery, a single event if you like. Is there a moment you can recall when the penny dropped that RNA interference was what you were looking at and you understood how it worked? / Terrifying, because they reveal the fact that one can’t explain it oneself but yes. One of the things we did this year for the first time was to invite some of the public to ask questions to you via the Internet and I’d like to, if I may, just pose a couple of those questions. First, a rather specific one from Kerry Austin in Texas who says, What application in genetics will offer the most effect use of RNA interference? / There was a time when people were talking a lot about the need for standards for such experiments. Is that time passed, are they now widely accepted for the publication of RNA interference?",

    "Some time has passed now since the first discoveries were made and technology has substantial developed. You can put it in perspective now, I suppose. What is the real significance, what is the big paradigm shift that has come about through this technology? / When you see it back in the history of science the paradigm shift is very often connected with the development of instruments. If you look on Galileo and the telescope, it changed our world view totally. You had Levenhuk and the microscope, it also changed our world view totally. What about this? / This is of course fundamentally important but aren’t you a little bit modest when you play it down this way because looking into the brain and see how we think and maybe also could make images out of our most spiritual experiences. Don’t you think that will somewhat change the way we probably look at courses? /But you’re using some very extraordinary phenomenon, down to the nuclear level of atoms and to the electron level of atoms. Do this phenomena exist or are they just measures in your instruments? Does spin exist?",
    "Does that mean that we are focusing in a way too much on the genes? There might be much more interesting knowledge to be gained from complexity and the interaction between all the other things that are around the gene. Who is deciding over the genes? / But the exciting thing is that it sounds as if there were some general knowledge to be harvested from this theory of complexity that could be applied even to economics and to associated questions or to other complex systems.

Is that so Arvid Carlsson? / But is there some sort of relation between the mind and the body in this respect that is basically the same mechanism that in a way controls the material world and the mental world? / And in this system you have discovered the chemical signal substances between the connection between the nerves, and Paul Greengard your discovery is really what is happening inside the cell. How does your discovery relate to how we react and how we are, how we experience the world? Are there any connections that you have thought of? / And they are related to what sort of mental phenomena? / And they are related to memory in what way? / So, memory and changes inside the nerve cells, Eric Kandel.

    "Let’s shift to something else. There are three key words in the will of Alfred Nobel. One is that the name of the prize is “Physiology or Medicine”, it’s not medicine which is physiology or medicine is a much broader field. The second thing is that the prize should be awarded for a discovery and it should be of greatest benefit to mankind. Of course the impact of these key words is consistently being discussed by the Nobel Assembly, but it is also now and then brought up in editorials in scientific journals. I don’t want you to judge the work that has been done by the Nobel Assembly but I would like you to put your work into these contexts in terms of discovery, in terms of benefit on mankind and physiology or medicine.",
    "We’ll return to that theme in a little while. I wanted to focus on the discovery that in particular led to the award of the Nobel Prize, together with Robert Furchgott and Louis Ignarro in 1998. You found that nitroglycerin, which had been around for 100 years and used to relieve chest pain and angina, works by the release of nitric oxide which is an unusual signalling molecule because it’s a gas and the question that seems to be begging is how come nobody had found this for 100 years?",
    "Welcome to meet the Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine for 1997, Dr Stanley Prusiner, the man who did as very few scientists do, but all of them will get Nobel Prizes I think, they really turn the concept we have upside down, and please tell me Dr Prusiner, what did you really turn upside down? / So in a way you challenged the central dogma of molecular biology at that time, that all the information was contained, the DNA and the RNA and the proteins were just the templates or the churning out of the … Now you’d proved that proteins in itself, in these cells right could contain information so to say?",

    "Now that we have two independent groups who have come to an agreement about the general structure of the human genome, maybe you are able to answer the question, how many genes are there in the human genome. It’s a question you get when you lecture in this field and I’ve heard widely varying figures so, now if you get the question, what would your answer be? / Because people are betting on the number and there is a need for an authoritative answer to this question from the gambling point of view and from the human centred views that we entertain. To drive these large projects, the human genome project, obviously there have been precursors, people have got news from physics now that they are enormous projects, big physics and you now have big biology coming around, so once the human genome project has been completed, how will we proceed? I think we would agree that the most important thing now is to find out how the genome functions and we now enter then a type of research where we want to study the ultimate products, the proteins. Since there are many ways in which you can process the information from the DNA and the genome, at the RNA level, there are many more proteins to be found. This field of studying the proteins made in biological systems is called proteomics, so do you see any such big proteomics coming along and what can be done in terms of technology to speed up the analysis of the much larger number of proteins than the number of genes?",

    "So this is not just a mechanical process? It is a question of interpretation? / Yes, there is this question, for example, when I see this flower and I see the red colour here, I recognise the colour here, I call it red. How can I be sure that the red colour that you see is the same that the one that I see? Do you think that neurophysiology can answer such questions? /  In spite of nearly 50 years of studies, I wonder what do you consider as the major step in our understanding of how the visual system works during these years.",
    "To be able to understand this valuable research that scientists are doing and which often takes many, many years, you then have to be able to explain it as well and I read a beautiful story that your daughter came up with. Could you just briefly relate them to us, as a way of describing what you found out. / That just makes this absolutely amazing. / The positive uses though of your achievements are many, the way research, medical research, have gone further.

Would you just give us an example that you are really feeling particularly proud of, where you know that your work has really benefited medicine?",

What is your answer then? / But if you understand the mechanisms or the things that are changing, you can see them, you can measure them, then you can influence the whole system.",
    "As the mechanism was worked out did the applicability of the discovery become much broader as well? Was it realised that it could be of much more benefit if you like?",

    "Three days ago, there was a major announcement, a major event in science, you could say, a joint announcement by groups in the United States and the United Kingdom about, I would say, a high-quality DNA sequence of the entire human genome and the significance of this event was underlined by the fact that two heads of state, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, had joined the press conference. We are happy to have here among us two Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine, Professor or Doctor Richard Roberts and Hamilton Smith who have been involved in various capacity in the human genome project.

    "So the prize this year is divided into two parts, but you are united in your work by the phrase the committee used such as ‘economic governance’ and broadly you both study ways of regulating transactions in the broader sense. If I could start with you, you study complex economic organizations and complex transactions and one part of your work that has been particularly sort of commented on by the committee is the fact that that allows you to say something about what sort of transactions should be conducted within firms and what sort of transactions should be conducted within a market. / Are you surprised to find yourself studying what you study? Because you mention that you started out studying entrepreneurship as a graduate student and now you study the commons, when you look back, is it odd that you ended up here?",
    "This is a perfect segway because I wanted to ask you about the development of models. It was in 1979 that you published your new trade theory and that is a model explaining why similar countries trade in similar goods. Now one can express the model in the theory in fairly sort of self-evident terms, simple language and it all sounds as if it makes sense and yet one needs an atheoretical underpinning based on proper economic science in order to really understand. / No, but I’m probably doing it clumsily, but what I was trying to get to was the idea that, because there is some plain English about it, people feel they ought to be able to sort of get to it themselves even if they haven’t got economics training, whereas they just don’t touch chemistry because it’s too far outside and that lays perhaps Economists open to people feeling, oh I could have understood that, I could have done that. / So the second model that the Prize Committee have quoted is your core periphery model which was also mentioned in 1979 and then further developed in 1991. /  That’s right, but no in fact one of the slanders against Economists, people used to say you know this stuff is just circular, you say that things agglomerate because of the agglomeration economies which was kind of the way that people talked about it and say no, actually we can derive those agglomeration economies, they’re about market size but to do it in such a way that you can say, but there are also centripetal forces that gives you some advantage to moving away from where … and then some kind of boundary condition that determines which of those prevails. That was not the way anybody was thinking about it until this new economic geography came along. / Absolutely, and your approach to this production is that you base it around the numbers, your reports are basically based on analysis of the numbers that other people aren’t doing. / But I mean there must be quite a lot of people who are qualified to look at the numbers but as you say, not that many people who are in the position to have a wide audience to look at what they’re saying.",

Ideally statistical testing should be a way of discriminating between alternative theories to weed out the weak theories. Do you think econometrics has been reasonably successful in this regard? / Do you think we should have much more of replication of existing empirical studies to check how robust the results are? Replications of econometrics studies to a much more systematic extent than we have seen so far. / Your works have been highly relevant for policy making. Do you see cases where your studies have had some impact on actual policy decisions? Dan.",
    "Your main contribution I think was that you made some general analysis which meant that previous analysis fell out as special cases of your general approach. / You mentioned your other important contribution, the so-called theory of optimum currency areas. Instead of asking the question “Should a nation have floating for fixed exchange rates?” you re-formulated the question and said “In which areas should people chose, regardless of nation states, fixed, floating rates, or should they form a monetary union?” And of course this idea about monetary union has become more and more important over the years, and the most important development recently of course is the European Monetary Union has been established. Do you think this was a good idea to create the European Monetary Union? Your theory of optimum currency areas emphasised the importance of high labour mobility within an area that had a common currency. And many people believe that Europe does not yet have that kind of labour mobility. And many people think that Europe is not the optimum currency area by your definition. What is your reflection about that? What do you think about the idea of European Monetary Union? / So what will happen with the dollar now when you get the European currency? Will that out-compete the dollar in world economy or is dollar so strong that it will stay as a dominating currence in currency world?",
    "Today during your speech you outlined something that I found very interesting. You were saying that households and individuals have had, over the last couple of years, to take much more serious economic decisions about how their, for example, pensions would look like in the future and so on. Would you please tell us a little bit more about what the consequences have been and what consequences you foresee in the future, for example for households and financial institutions? / Could this be a way of reducing the risk in a way? I mean people have been quite upset, if you look at Sweden, for example. We’re only now starting to realize that a large group of us will not have a pension that we thought we would have, because things have shifted and we were forced or made to believe that we had to make certain decisions. Do you think the risk for the individual will be less? / The fields of economics is often to people from the outside very theoretical, but really it’s about daily life.

But what did it give you, because you have said that you wanted to do something useful and something new, and at that time there was this whole idea of helping the developing world to greater economy, to, you know, narrow the gap? / There has to be incentives for people to pay tax somehow. When I look at the optimal taxation model, the idea is that you need to feel that you’re getting something back you know so that you actually pay, if I’m not simplifying it too much. Would you just tell us a little bit about the way you see the taxation system? From that point of view it may be forwards. You know where are we today, the so-called Western world?

Today, how valid is it? And obviously it’s used a lot, but do you see that it needs to be revised at times? How do you look at that theory that you then brought up, so to speak?",

In Germany, for example, the government is suggesting that jobless people should stay on the social benefits, but above that get a job and only get paid one euro an hour. Is that a way to move ahead, to try to solve this enormous problem of the joblessness and the less work that is available to people in this part of the world? / Could there be another solution to the so called Western problem of ageing population, less people working. There are millions of people in the so called Third World who really would like to come and earn a living in this part of the world, but they are not really welcome."

And we have already started on this journey where we really work more and more with governments, not just to give them suggestions but to kind of learn together. And I think this will help even more in terms of opening doors and making, reassuring various governments with whom we are not yet working, you know this is legitimate and not a strange undertaking by some crazy people so I think that will help a lot.

    "Yes, I have a completely different question. You frequently emphasise the power of literature and of narrative, most recently in the Nobel lecture. Do you think that literature and the author have more power than is generally recognised?

This topic, image of our country, how did you come to that?",
    "So the sections of conventional third person narrative in the novel, the bits which aren’t written in Anna’s notebooks are titled Free women and when I was re-reading it recently, that came to sound almost sarcastic actually / And you’ve done fantasy although I don’t know if fantasy’s the right word for it but quite recently, I mean only a year ago, you published The Cleft which is … is fantasy the right word for it, it’s an extraordinary kind of imaginative projection of a sort of primitive tale in which the female sex pre-existed the male sex and then … / And I’m interested if you were conscious of this at the time. The heroine, the protagonist, she’s hardly heroic in it. The interesting thing about it seems to be that she is where a lot of our interest lies, but she’s also in some ways quite obnoxious I suppose, or she behaves badly. And you have a strange mixture of sympathy and disgust. / The books that followed that, did that … did the success of The Grass is Singing sort of make you think: Right, I can now be a writer. This is going to be my career, I can actually survive doing this? / And in these novels, Martha gets involved, as I think you did, in Marxism, in communist politics, doesn’t she? Did you sort feel looking back that that was kind of a rich material for fiction? / I suppose this is a trick of time that now people think of The Golden Notebook, I mean the politics you’re talking about is sort of perhaps hidden history to lots of its new readers and they notice the sexual politics, I suppose, of it, much more than they notice what you’ve been saying about communism and the end of lots of peoples’ faith in that. And they notice, they notice I suppose, things about … I mean, how it seems an extraordinary satire on actually the behaviour of men. That’s one thing I think I noticed recently. I mean the men in the novel are a pretty ghastly lot aren’t they?",

But I think in the theatre that the young actors, for instance, we have a group of actors coming out of that background who can take in the idea of playing Shakespeare as easily as if they can do a rap number, so that mix is great. / Is there a valuable contribution that is evolving all of the time?

    "A reading from ‘Die Wiederholung’ (’Repetition’) by Peter Handke",
    "Later on you wrote other novels, but gradually you came to move away from the novel in the classical sense. To me, this process begins already with The Loss of El Dorado, which is a book that resembles nothing else. I can think of very few parallels to that book. I mean, it’s not a piece of history in the ordinary sense, it’s not a novel, it’s not a fantasy, it’s documentary in a sense, but it has the atmosphere of a piece of fiction without being one. How did you find that form? / But you came to discover that you had landed upon a new way of writing, a new method in this book, because later when you reflect on, for instance, when you found the name Chaguanas in the archives you had become aware that there was something in fiction that didn’t quite suit your needs, and that you had to develop a form that was more tied to factual details, and to the actual utterings of people that you had met. And let me recall another thing you said, just the other week, at the press conference when you arrived in Stockholm, and someone asked you your opinion of Stendhal, and it so happened that you had just re-read his two major novels, and become violently disappointed with them, having been an ardent admirer of Stendhal. This must mean that to you the novel, after all, is a form of some importance and that makes high demands on its writer, and perhaps even a very gifted man like Stendhal was not able to answer to that demand. / I think that if you look at your writing as a whole, there are at least to me two books that tower over the landscape, one we have already mentioned, A House for Mr Biswas, the other one being The Enigma of Arrival, which to me is one of the true masterpieces of contemporary literature, and an amazingly difficult book to describe. One doesn’t know quite what it is. Did that also just evolve? / However, if you look at the title of that book, The Enigma of Arrival, it first puzzles the reader, but after a while you come to a chapter where the whole thing is explained, it goes back to a painting or, to be exact, a reproduction of a painting by de Chirico, and you make a sort of reading or interpretation of that painting and you tell a little story, and that is the enigma of arrival. Well, that story I personally find to be completely amazing. It so fascinated me when I read it, and also the fact that you make practically no use of that story in the book. It is just there, isolated. But still it radiates a sort of energy into everything else in that book. And I have to ask you, how you came to this fantasy, because it isn’t really in the picture. This is something that you have found."
